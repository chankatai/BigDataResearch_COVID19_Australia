The top US health agency on Thursday announced it was lifting mask-wearing requirements for people fully vaccinated against Covid-19, a watershed moment in the pandemic.
"For somebody who's already been fully vaccinated, they can wear the mask out of solidarity or in a symbolic sense, but their wearing a mask indoors is not benefiting anyone else," explained Vinay Prasad, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Labor leader Anthony Albanese has delivered his budget reply speech, taking aim at the federal government for being “all announcement, no delivery”.

“I understand the value and the power of good government,” he said.

“I know our country needs and deserves a good government again, a government that believes in your potential.

“A prime minister who shares your values, a Labor government that’s on your side.”

Mr Albanese spoke of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government’s response to it.

“When we look at the devastation and heartbreak still unfolding in parts of the world, it’s only natural to feel that things could have been a lot worse here,” he said.

“Yet when I look at our country today, I also know we can do so much better.

“So much better than real wages declining over the next four years, after flatlining over the last eight years.

“So much better than three more years of scandal and a government treating taxpayers’ funds as if they were Liberal Party funds.

“So much better than three more years of announcements that are never delivered.”

Public health teams are continuing working to identify, test and trace people who’ve been in contact with the man.

Victoria recorded no new local cases on Thursday.

Acting Premier James Merlino said on Thursday that 67 people who came in contact
hadn’t contracted the virus after coming into contact with a Melbourne man who caught the virus in hotel quarantine in Adelaide.
He said a further 48 people were expected to receive their results within the next 24 to 36 hours.
One of the exposure sites was the Curry Vault restaurant in the CBD, where 42 patrons and staff were identified as primary close contacts.
So far, 34 negative test results have so far been returned.
SA Health has also ordered 10 South Australians who stayed on the same floor as the Victorian man in hotel quarantine to complete a further two weeks in isolation.

Australians "deserve" to know the truth behind governments' handling of COVID-19 and there are enough reasons to "justify" a full public investigation with a royal commission into the pandemic, according to Sky News host Peta Credlin.

"We've just had federal royal commissions into aged care, disability care, banking, and bushfires ... We're about to have a royal commission into veterans suicides. So why not into this pandemic," Ms Credlin said.

"We deserve the truth.

"If the British government, that has done so much worse than our own, is still prepared to have its actions scrutinised, what is Scott Morrison scared of? What is Daniel Andrews scared of, Annastacia Palaszczuk, Mark McGowan - all of them?

"All of this matters now, and it matters for the future because while we don't know when the next pandemic will come, we know that it will come, that's for certain."

Comedian David Hughes has upset his large fanbase after getting the COVID vaccine live on air.
During a segment on the Hughesy, Ed and Erin radio show, they had Dr Van Mai on to give the host his jab.
“This is big for us,” Hughesy said. “We’re nervous.”
“So am I,” Dr Mai joked.
People were not impressed with the radio star. Picture: InstagramSource:Instagram
RELATED: Seven new blood clot cases after vaccine
“You’re nervous because of the radio, not because of the procedure,” Hughesy added. “The procedure is something you have done a number of times?”
“Quite a few,” Dr Mai confirmed.
Hughesy went on to get his vaccine live on air, stating he didn’t even feel it when it happened.
However, this wasn’t something that sat well with some fans after the clip was uploaded to Instagram, with many claiming there was nothing in the syringe and that Hughesy was part of some conspiracy theory.
Many commenters said it was a fake vaccine. Picture: InstagramSource:Instagram

The comments rolled in:
“I thought Hughesy was smarter than that,” wrote one user.
“Puppets,” stated another.
“Show the actual vial. Just more propaganda.”
“Oh no. How the hell can someone do this to themselves. So many deaths #vaccinesuicide.”
There have been rare cases of serious adverse reactions from the AstraZeneca vaccine, however governments and medical groups have maintained COVID vaccines are safe for the vast majority of people. In Australia, it’s recommended people under the age of 50 receive the Pfizer vaccine.
Some people on Hughesy’s social media profile questioned whether or not Hughesy was paid to advertise the vaccine.
“How much did you get paid to do that??? ppffttt ...vaccines are KILLING people are your promoting them [sic]. Disgraceful.”
“Garbage! There’s nothing in the syringe, that’s very obvious!! Such blatant lies!”
“Lol clown. enjoy being a puppet [sic]. I’ll stick to remaining healthy without being coerced into toxic injections from gov and b grade celebrities [sic].”
“Weird move by celebs publicising this. You literally stand to gain nothing (people aren’t all of a sudden going to start loving you because of this). Instead you stand to lose a huge amount of followers who don’t agree with coercion/selling out. Anyway - as you were.”
“Idiots good luck with your adverse reactions [sic].”
“Would help if he actually pressed the plunger down ya gooses [sic]. Sellouts!!!! #boycottfakemedia.”

Kiwi trainer Tony Pike was forced to watch his horses race under rival trainers last year but he’s back in Queensland and eager to make his presence felt.

Astute trainer Tony Pike has an enviable record in Queensland and after a COVID-19-enforced break, he is back with a team of horses he says will make their presence felt in the winter carnival.
Pike was the toast of the town in 2019 after lifting The Bostonian to win both Group 1 features, the Doomben 10,000 (1200m) and Kingsford-Smith Cup (1300m), but hasn’t been able to saddle up a runner in the Sunshine State since.
Describing 2020 as a “shambles”, Pike was forced to transfer horses to other trainers if he wanted to race in Australia, but a recently established trans-Tasman travel bubble has breathed life into the Kiwi’s hopes of Group 1 glory this time around.
Pike will kick off Not An Option’s second Queensland campaign on Saturday after he fell flat in last year’s JJ Atkins at Eagle Farm.
While it is away from the bright lights of group-level racing, Pike is happy to start the colt back in the three-year-old plate (1350m) as he readies for a Fred Best showdown with boom galloper Ayrton in a fortnight.
“We need to get a run under his belt because he unfortunately pulled up with cardiac arrhythmia in his last start,” he said.
“He hasn’t run for a fair while, he had the two trials going in but we want to get him going for the Fred Best.
“He is drawn to get a reasonably soft run so I think he will run well, and then with a run under his belt I wouldn’t have thought he would be far off in the Fred Best.
“Obviously it is a ballot-free race so if he was able to win that, you’d consider the Stradbroke but we just want to get through Saturday first.”

Forced to watch on from New Zealand last year while his horses raced under the names of rival trainers, Pike is excited to be back in Queensland this time around.
“It was a shambles last year, it’s unfortunate because he was unlucky not to run in the top two in the (Group 1) Champagne Stakes last year then we pretty much had to pack the team up overnight and get them home,” he said, with the horse quickly transferring to Richard and Michael Freedman.
“Trying to train them over the phone wasn’t easy so it is good to be back in Brisbane for the first time in a couple of years, that is for sure.”
Pike also sends a three-pronged attack to the Sunshine Coast on Sunday where a half-brother to super mare Melody Belle begins his Australian career.
Tutukaka will have his second career start as Pike eyes some black-type races later in the carnival.

One state has announced a major change to its coronavirus restrictions, including where people need to wear masks.
Health Minister Greg Hunt has officially announced the completion of a contract between Moderna and Australia which secures 25 million MRNA vaccine doses for the nation. The agreement includes 10 million shots this year which are effective against the 'ancestral strain' of COVID-19 while the remaining 15 million will be updated variant booster shots delivered in 2022. Mr Hunt said the Moderna deal served two primary purposes and would play both a more immediate and future role in Australia's troubled vaccine rollout. 'Firstly, as a reserve supply for this year if other elements of the supply chain were to run into any challenges. Secondly, they are our foundation of a booster and variant strategy,' he said. 'Moderna is, on the advice that we have, the most advanced of the vaccine products with relation to the capacity to adapt to booster or variant requirements.' Mr Hunt said the Moderna agreement marked 'the next stage' of future proofing and of preparing for the future. The Health Minister also touted what he described as an 'approach to market' relating to MRNA production which will be opened by Christian Porter in the next 10 days. 'We are already in active discussions with Moderna as a possible candidate under that approach to market.' 'Our hope is that we will have at least one if not more than one manufacturing operations in Australia'.

The Perth and Peel regions will entirely return to pre-lockdown life this weekend, including ditching face masks, after successfully “crushing” COVID-19.
Western Australia has not had any new local cases since May 1 after a hotel security guard and two of his housemates tested positive.
Premier Mark McGowan said that meant the coronavirus restrictions would be lifted from 12.01am on Saturday, pending no further cases.

It means masks will only be required at the airport, which is a national rule.
There will be no capacity limits for funerals and weddings, and gatherings at homes will no longer be limited either.
Restrictions on the number of people visiting aged care facilities and hospitals will also be lifted.
Stadiums will return to 100 per cent capacity too.
“This is fantastic news for our community, businesses and the state’s economy,” Mr McGowan told reporters on Thursday.
“The return to pre-lockdown life is only possible because of the collective effort of all West Australians.”
Mr McGowan said the situation would be reviewed again in one month, then the state could possibly transition to remove the remaining restrictions and adjust to a new phase five.
But he warned people should not be complacent.
“The pandemic is not over yet and won’t be for some time, but we have the systems in place to manage it,” he said.

Confusion over the vaccine rollout ensued after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Aussies would get two shots by the end of 2021.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has walked back a budget forecast for Australia's vaccine rollout to be largely completed by the end of the year. Despite it being one of the key assumptions underpinning his budget numbers Mr Morrison said the prediction is not a government policy or promise. There is also confusion about whether the budget projection pointed to all Australians having received one or two doses this year. On Tuesday Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the 'exact wording' in the book is about the vaccine likely being rolled out by the end of the year to all Australians who want it. Mr Frydenberg said there was also an 'assumption they'll get those two doses by that time'. However, despite the comments from the treasurer, Mr Morrison now says there is no firm timeline or commitment for two doses by the end of the year.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has fallen into line over the national COVID-19 vaccine rollout timeline after contradicting the Prime Minister.
The treasurer sparked confusion on Tuesday by saying the budget assumed every Australian who wanted to be vaccinated would get two shots by the end of the year.
But he backed away from the comments during question time on Thursday, quoting Scott Morrison, who earlier moved to allay the confusion.
“The budget does not rest on this assumption entirely,” Mr Frydenberg told parliament.
“That is what the Prime Minister said.
“The reason being is a key factor that will help drive the momentum in our economic recovery is our ability to continue to suppress the virus.”

Mr Frydenberg said the date of a person’s second vaccine dose was dictated by their first.
But that did not stop opposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers from grilling Mr Frydenberg over the apparent contradiction.
“Why did the treasurer say on Tuesday that budget outcomes are based on an assumption that Australians will receive two doses of the COVID vaccine by the end of this year?” Dr Chalmers asked.
Mr Frydenberg replied: “The key point that (Dr Chalmers) and the house needs to understand is these are assumptions, not policy decisions by the government.”
He said they were based on the best medical advice available.
“The assumption is very clear in budget paper number one … a population-wide vaccination program is likely to be in place by the end of 2021,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Aged Care Services Minister Richard Colbeck said Australians were never expected to have two COVID-19 doses before the end of 2021.
“I don’t see where that suggestion comes from,” Mr Colbeck said.
Mr Frydenberg told parliament it was important that the vaccines were rolled out “as quickly as possible”.
Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday announced that Moderna would supply 25 million vaccine doses to Australia under a new deal.
“Importantly, that allows us to have a medium term strategy where we are focusing next year on the ability to have booster and variant capacity,” Mr Hunt said.

One state has brought in tough new COVID-19 regulations that could see some businesses slapped with thousands of dollars in fines.
The Victorian government has been urged to speed up its QR code check-in system rollout after contact tracers faced difficulties because a restaurant attended by the Victorian COVID-19 case was not enforcing mandatory check-ins. The man in his 30s completed hotel quarantine in South Australia before returning home to Victoria earlier this month. He began showing symptoms on May 8 and returned a positive test on Tuesday but at this stage it is an isolated case. However, a group of South Australians will have to re-enter quarantine after genomic sequencing revealed the source of the Victorian man’s infection was linked to the hotel they had been isolating in.

Victorian businesses not complying with QR code rules will be slapped with a $1652 fine, under tough new regulations now into effect.
The Victorian Government introduced the fines after contact tracers scrambled to track dozens of people who dined at a city restaurant, where a positive-COVID case visited last week.
Under the new regulation, businesses found intentionally flouting the code system will be issued the fine, along with an improvement notice and a follow up visit.
Repeated breaches would incur a further $9913 fine and businesses may be prosecuted in court for continued breaches.
Acting Premier James Merlino said on Thursday there had been a ‘serious challenge’ in the public’s uptake of the QR system, as a feeling of complacency had set in.
“The issue of compliance in recent times has been a real issue that we’re tackling,” Mr Merlino told reporters.
“It’s partly human nature. This has been a long pandemic and there’s a level of complacency and we need to combat that.

“We are not out of this pandemic and we won’t be out of it until we have successfully delivered the Commonwealth’s vaccine program.”
The warning comes after Melbourne city restaurant the Curry Vault was listed as a tier 1 public exposure site, after a man who later tested positive to coronavirus dined at the venue between 6.30pm and 9.30pm on May 7.
About 30 to 40 customers were in the restaurant at the time but not all had signed in using the QR code.

Acting police minister Danny Pearson said venues and facilities in the state were required to maintain an electronic record-keeping system for all visitors.
A recent COVID safe Blitz in April, where more than 4,000 hospitality and retail businesses were checked for compliance, saw more than 165 enforcement notices issued, as well as a further 300 verbal warnings.
“While most businesses are doing the right thing, those who aren’t are letting down every Victorian who has sacrificed to get us where we are today,” Mr Pearson said.
“This new on-the-spot $1652 fine sends a clear message that we will not tolerate any business ignoring its responsibility to help Victoria stay safe and stay open.”

A new outbreak of COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through Vietnam, a nation once praised for containing its outbreaks quickly through targeted mass testing and its strict quarantine system.

Vietnam is currently in its fourth wave of COVID-19 since the pandemic began and a large wave was “inevitable”, according to Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Director Professor Guy Thwaites.

“They’re getting it under control, I’m pretty confident they will do so, yes, there were 100 cases on Monday but the number are slowly coming down now rather than going up,” he told Sky News. 

“They’re doing what they have done well in the past which is identifying infections, tracking, tracing, and quarantining very large quantities of people.”

Professor Thwaites said there was only one case in Ho Chi Minh City and but there have been “30-70 cases a day” for the last few days in Hanoi and Penang because the populace were getting relaxed about antivirus measures. 

“People have been a little bit relaxed about it and maintaining this level of vigilance and maintaining this level of awareness in the population that things could change if you don’t mask and keep social distance".

"That’s something that’s become more difficult unless vaccination are widespread soon.”

Australia appears closer to making mRNA vaccines onshore, while a supply deal for 25 million doses of the Moderna jab has been secured.
Minister for Senior Australians Richard Colbeck has touted an agreement between Australia and Moderna which recently secured 25 million doses of the pharmaceutical company's coronavirus vaccine. It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison walked back a budget forecast for Australia’s vaccine rollout to be largely completed by the end of the year. Mr Colbeck told Sky News the deal meant “more good news in the context of vaccine supply” for the nation but pointed out the purchase of the vaccine still required TGA approval. “My understanding is that some of the doses will become available later this year so that again is good news but of course it still does have to go through the TGA approval process,” he said. The agreement includes 10 million shots this year which are effective against the 'ancestral strain' of COVID-19 while the remaining 15 million jabs of Moderna's updated variant booster candidate will be delivered in 2022. In a statement Moderna's CEO said, &quot;as we seek to protect people around the world with our COVID-19 vaccine and potentially our variant booster candidates”. “We look forward to continuing discussions with Australia about establishing potential local manufacturing opportunities.&quot;

Health Minister Greg Hunt says he’s “confident” mRNA vaccines will be able to be produced on Australian soil in the near future, with his comments coming as Moderna announced a 25 million dose supply deal.
The drug manufacturer also announced its interest in building manufacturing capability in Australia, as the government allocated money for it in this week’s federal budget.
Mr Hunt on Thursday said he hoped Australia would have at least one, if not more, manufacturing operation.
“I won’t make a guarantee on that, but I am confident that over the future period, we will have mRNA production in Australia,” Mr Hunt said.
“There are a range of potentially very viable approaches and proposals.”
Health Minister Greg Hunt said this was the next stage of future-proofing. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Gary RamageSource:News Corp Australia
Industry Minister Christian Porter will lead the approach to market in the next 10 days.
Moderna joins CSL and Biosena, which have publicly acknowledged their interest in establishing mRNA capability in Australia.
Mr Hunt said there was also others, but the government didn’t know if they would put forward proposals.
“Certainly we would prefer private-sector owned and operated. That is an important way to do it,” he said.
Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy said it was unlikely capability would be established this year.
“It is going to be some time next year, I would imagine, before mRNA vaccines can be produced here,” Professor Murphy said.
“MRNA vaccine technology is likely to be much broader than COVID vaccine. So it is something that we in Australia need to have anyway.
“Our primary vaccination strategy is in no way dependent on this.”

Professor Murphy said the capability would also aid flu and other novel vaccine manufacturing in the future.
“We are one of the small number of countries that have onshore sovereign vaccine manufacturing capability and we want to keep ahead of the game in that space,” he said.
Moderna chief executive Stéphane Bancel said the company plans to open a commercial subsidiary in Australia this year.
“We appreciate the partnership and support from the government of Australia with this first supply agreement for doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and our variant booster candidates,” Mr Bancel said in a statement.
“We look forward to continuing discussions with Australia about establishing potential local manufacturing opportunities.”
CSL will continue to manufacture doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, which does not use mRNA technology, in Victoria.

Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced the Coalition is currently in negotiations with Moderna over the possible production of the pharmaceutical company’s vaccine on Australian soil.

It comes as the Morrison government looks to open a local MRNA vaccine manufacturing facility to further secure the nation’s vaccine supply.

“Moderna is, on the advice that we have, the most advanced of the vaccine products with relation to the capacity to adapt to booster or variant requirements,” he told Sky News. 

The Health Minister also touted what he described as an “approach to market” relating to MRNA production which will be opened by Christian Porter in the next 10 days.

“We are already in active discussions with Moderna as a possible candidate under that approach to market.”

New data has revealed the suburbs first-home buyers armed with government incentives are looking to buy in to, including one surprising location.
What the 2021 federal budget means for property
Soaring home values in the wake of COVID-19 have pushed many first-home buyers to Sydney’s outer ring suburbs and beyond in an attempt to capitalise on better price deals.
New data from InfoTrack revealed seven of the 10 most popular suburbs for first-home buyers in NSW were in Sydney’s west.

The research found first-home buyers sought out areas that offered greater affordability than suburbs close to the CBD.
The most in-demand suburb was Marsden Park in Sydney’s northwest with a median house price of $829,000, followed by Austral in Sydney’s southwest. Oran Park, Schofield and Campbelltown rounded out the top five.

Hamlyn Terrace and Gosford on the Central Coast and Wagga Wagga were the three most popular destinations outside of Sydney.
InfoTrack CEO John Ahern said first-home buyer demand had increased significantly in the past year with March recording a 25 per cent increase in activity from the group.
“What is promising is that first-home buyer activity is still 40 per cent more active than in April 2020,” he said.
The most popular postcodes were also areas that allowed buyers to build brand new homes, a path to homeownership that was spurred on by the Federal Government’s HomeBuilder grant.
The COVID-inspired scheme, which launched in June 2020 and finished in April 2021, offered all homebuyers $25,000 (then $15,000) to build or renovate a home.

Thrive Homes general manager Janelle Goulding said recent government incentives had propelled demand from first-home buyers looking to build in popular house and land enclaves such as Marsden Park and Oran Park.
“The past few months have been some of our best months ever because of the incentives,” she said.
“First-home buyers have flocked to these suburbs on the outer ring because they are about the only areas in Sydney where you can taker advantage of the stimulus measures.”

Auctioneer Tom Panos said first-home buyer activity remained high because of FOMO (fear of missing out), despite house prices soaring by 9.3 per cent since the start of the year.
“Many first-home buyers were happy renting, but have now changed direction and want to buy because even with rent reductions, interest rates are so low that it’s cheaper to buy than to rent,” Mr Panos said.
It comes as the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced in Tuesday’s budget a further 10,000 places to the First Home Loan Deposit scheme, which has been rebranded as the New Home Guarantee. The scheme allows first-home buyers of newly built or under construction homes to purchase with only a 5 per cent deposit.

As US officials scramble to convince citizens to get vaccinated against Covid-19, one state is putting its money where its mouth is -- offering millions in lottery prizes for those who have received an injection.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine tweeted Wednesday that his state will give a $1 million prize away every week for five weeks in a lottery open to residents over the age of 18 who have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine.

Victoria has recorded no new local COVID-19 cases overnight but the state is entering a critical 36-hour window that will determine the extent of any spread.
A group of South Australians will have to re-enter quarantine after genomic sequencing revealed the source of a Victorian man's infection is linked to their hotel. Victoria recorded no new local cases, a day after the man tested positive.

Victoria has entered a critical two-day period that will determine the scale of any COVID spread in the state, following a positive case in the community.
The state recorded no new local cases on Thursday despite 84 people being deemed close contacts of a man who tested positive after completing hotel quarantine.
Acting Premier James Merlino said on Thursday that 67 people hadn’t contracted the virus after coming into contact with a Melbourne man who caught the virus in hotel quarantine in Adelaide.
He said a further 48 people were expected to receive their results within the next 24 to 36 hours.
“The broad message today is pretty positive,” Mr Merlino said.
“We know the source was South Australian hotel quarantine, so we’re not chasing an unknown source.
“So so far, so good.”
More than 20,000 people in Melbourne have taken COVID tests in the past day. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Ian CurrieSource:News Corp Australia
The state undertook 21,382 tests over 24 hours.
One new case was reported for the state in hotel quarantine
The Melbourne man who tested positive on Tuesday had arrived in Australia from COVID-ravaged India and caught the virus in hotel quarantine.
The man, aged in his 30s, had completed his isolation in South Australia after returning to Australia from India via the Maldives on April 19.
He returned to his Wollert home in Melbourne’s north on May 4 and developed symptoms four days later.
All three of his primary household contacts have so far tested negative.
At least 16 of 28 patrons and staff who attended the Curry Vault Indian restaurant in the CBD on Friday night have tested negative.

When asked if authorities were considering fining businesses or individuals over failing to use the state’s QR system, Mr Merlino said options were currently being investigated.
He said there had been a ‘serious challenge’ in the public’s uptake of the QR system, as a feeling of complacency set in.
“The issue of compliance in recent times has been a real issue that we’re tackling,” Mr Merlino said.
“We’re looking at all our options to improve the level of compliance and enforcement is one of those things.
“We need to look seriously at what more can we do in regards to ensuring businesses do what they need to do.”

A further 11 of 17 people who attended the Pact Altona North exposure site and five of eight people who attended the Indiagate Epping exposure site have tested negative.
At least 28 people have been identified as close contacts from the Woolworths Epping exposure site, with nine returning negative results so far.
Messages are also being sent to AFL ticket holders returning home on trains after Friday night football as well as registered myki holders linked to two train services on the Craigieburn line that the man travelled on.
Messages have also been sent to 396,000 people who live in communities near the exposure sites.
SA Health has also ordered 10 South Australians who stayed on the same floor as the man in hotel quarantine to complete a further two weeks in isolation.

A scathing independent review commissioned by the World Health Organisation has slammed the health body’s failure to act quickly during the early days of the pandemic.

The review found the WHO was too slow to declare a public health emergency, there was a failure to impose travel restrictions and countries failed to respond to the warnings quickly enough.

The expert panel recommended a global alert system be put in place which is allowed to publish information without the permission of impacted countries.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison played a pivotal role in calling for the review and addressed the conclusions this morning on 2GB radio.

Confusion continues over when Aussies will get two COVID-19 jabs, with another minister weighing in on the government’s plan.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has walked back a budget forecast for Australia's vaccine rollout to be largely completed by the end of the year. Despite it being one of the key assumptions underpinning his budget numbers Mr Morrison said the prediction is not a government policy or promise. There is also confusion about whether the budget projection pointed to all Australians having received one or two doses this year. On Tuesday Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the 'exact wording' in the book is about the vaccine likely being rolled out by the end of the year to all Australians who want it. Mr Frydenberg said there was also an 'assumption they'll get those two doses by that time'. However, despite the comments from the treasurer, Mr Morrison now says there is no firm timeline or commitment for two doses by the end of the year.

Australians were never expected to have two COVID-19 doses before the end of 2021, Aged Care Services Minister Richard Colbeck says.
The development comes as Moderna has also announced it will supply 25 million vaccines doses to Australia under a new supply deal.
Confusion continues over the vaccine timeline after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday handed down the federal budget, which was based on the assumption that a “population-wide vaccination program” would likely be in place by the end of the year.
“The assumption is that every Australian who wants to get two shots of the vaccine (will be able to) by the end of the year,” Mr Frydenberg said.
But Mr Colbeck said the government aspired to get everyone who wants a vaccine their first dose.
“For it to be two doses, you will have to bring that forward significantly and that’s never been part of our plans … because there was 12 weeks between doses,” Mr Colbeck told ABC’s RN.
“So I don’t see where that suggestion comes from.”

Under a new supply agreement announced by Moderna on Wednesday night, Australia has secured 25 million doses of the mRNA vaccine.
This includes 10 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine against the ancestral strain to be delivered in 2021, and 15 million doses of the company’s updated variant booster vaccine candidate to be delivered in 2022.
Moderna is yet to apply for approval from Australia’s drug regulator but says it expects to submit an application shortly.
Scott Morrison said first doses would support the vaccine rollout later this year among people aged under 50.
The prime minister said the government was trying to bring forward the rollout of additional Pfizer doses into the third quarter, while five million people could get Moderna, which is due to arrive in the fourth quarter.

“There is then another 15 million of what is called booster doses,” Mr Morrison told 6PR.
“That is a different vaccine again, that is next year, and that is to deal with possible variants.
“We are now well in the phase of what is coming next because the pandemic is not going anywhere.”
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler welcomed the Moderna announcement but questioned why it had taken so long.
“If the rest of the world struck deals with Moderna as early as last year for access to this state-of-the-art vaccine, why do Australians have to wait to the end of this year?” he said.
“What happened to Scott Morrison’s promise that Australians were at the front of the vaccine queue?”
Labor treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers accused the government of playing catch up.
“What has been obvious to everybody else is that the government didn’t do enough deals to get the vaccination program going as well as it should be,” Dr Chalmers said.
“That has costs and consequences for the vaccine rollout and therefore for the economy.”

Outspoken crossbench Senator Jacqui Lambie told Today the Moderna announcement came out of nowhere.
“I’m still trying to work out how I can lie that I’m under 50 … so I can get the Pfizer shot,” she joked.
Mr Colbeck said about 80 per cent of the aged care sector, excluding the workforce, had now been vaccinated.
“We’ll have all aged care residents having had their first dose in the next couple of weeks,” Mr Colbeck said.
He said advice from the US recommended against vaccinating workers and residents at the same time because it affected care delivery.
This came on top of health advice about blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Mr Colbeck said prompted authorities to “reset the workforce rollout”.

Minister for Senior Australians Richard Colbeck has touted an agreement between Australia and Moderna which recently secured 25 million doses of the pharmaceutical company's coronavirus vaccine.

It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison walked back a budget forecast for Australia’s vaccine rollout to be largely completed by the end of the year.

Mr Colbeck told Sky News the deal meant “more good news in the context of vaccine supply” for the nation but pointed out the purchase of the vaccine still required TGA approval. 

“My understanding is that some of the doses will become available later this year so that again is good news but of course it still does have to go through the TGA approval process,” he said.

The agreement includes 10 million shots this year which are effective against the 'ancestral strain' of COVID-19 while the remaining 15 million jabs of Moderna's updated variant booster candidate will be delivered in 2022.

In a statement Moderna's CEO said, "as we seek to protect people around the world with our COVID-19 vaccine and potentially our variant booster candidates”.

“We look forward to continuing discussions with Australia about establishing potential local manufacturing opportunities."

The Victorian government has been urged to speed up its QR code check-in system rollout after contact tracers faced difficulties because a restaurant attended by the Victorian COVID-19 case was not enforcing mandatory check-ins.

The man in his 30s completed hotel quarantine in South Australia before returning home to Victoria earlier this month.

He began showing symptoms on May 8 and returned a positive test on Tuesday but at this stage it is an isolated case.

However, a group of South Australians will have to re-enter quarantine after genomic sequencing revealed the source of the Victorian man’s infection was linked to the hotel they had been isolating in.

Returned travellers on the same floor as the nation’s latest community COVID case have been ordered back into two weeks quarantine.
A group of South Australians will have to re-enter quarantine after genomic sequencing revealed the source of a Victorian man's infection is linked to their hotel. Victoria recorded no new local cases, a day after the man tested positive.

Returned travellers staying on the same floor as the latest COVID-19 leak from hotel quarantine have been ordered back into two weeks isolation.
South Australia‘s chief health officer Nicola Spurrier confirmed on Wednesday evening out of “an abundance of caution” those people who were on the same level at the same time as a Victorian man who later tested positive would be required to quarantine for a further 14 days.
She also confirmed genomic sequencing results had determined the Victorian man’s infection was linked to a positive case at the Tom’s Court medi-hotel in Adelaide.
Professor Spurrier said investigations into the precise cause of transmission were ongoing but those on level three of the Playford Hotel would have to isolate again.

The Melbourne man who tested positive had arrived in Australia from COVID-ravaged India and caught the virus in hotel quarantine.
The man, aged in his 30s, had completed hotel quarantine in South Australia after returning to Australia from India via the Maldives on April 19.
He returned to his Wollert home in Melbourne’s north on May 4 and developed symptoms four days later.

“Those people who were on level three of the hotel during the period of concern who have subsequently been discharged will be required to quarantine for a further 14 days,” Professor Spurrier said in a statement.
“This includes 10 South Australians who will be able to quarantine at home, if the home setting is suitable.”
An SA Health spokeswoman said 24 other international travellers also quarantining on the third floor of the Playford Hotel had since returned to Queensland, Victoria and NSW.
But she said it would be up to each state’s individual chief health officer as to whether they would also be required to isolate for a further 14 days.
She said SA Health had previously contacted all of the 24 returned travellers and advised them to isolate until they received a negative result.
A NSW Health spokeswoman said four people on the same floor who returned to NSW after completing quarantine would also have to isolate until 14 days after May 4 – the day the positive case in Victoria left the Playford Hotel.
Queensland Health said eight people who were on level three had also been told to isolate for 14 days from their last exposure at the Playford Hotel, with seven of those in home quarantine and one at a hotel.
Victoria’s health department said six people were undertaking 14 days quarantine and urgently getting tested on Thursday.
SA Health said the “vast majority” of medi-hotel staff working at the time had their required daily testing.

“There are only five medi-hotel staff that we are still following up,” they said.
Victorian health authorities have identified 81 primary close contacts from four venues that were deemed exposure sites during the four days the man spent in the community.
The Victorian health department said 41 primary contacts had tested negative so far.
The have been no positive community cases linked to the man at this stage, with his three household primary close contacts also returning negative results.

US company Moderna has announced a new supply agreement with Australia for 25 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine.
The biotechnology firm said this would include 10 million doses of its jab against the original “ancestral” strain of coronavirus in 2021 and 15 million doses of its variant booster candidate for delivery in 2022.
The agreement is subject to approval of the messenger RNA vaccine and booster candidates by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the company said in a press release.
“We appreciate the partnership and support from the government of Australia with this first supply agreement for doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and our variant booster candidates,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna.

“As we seek to protect people around the world with our COVID-19 vaccine and potentially our variant booster candidates, we look forward to continuing discussions with Australia about establishing potential local manufacturing opportunities.”
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not immediately respond to news.com.au’s request for comment.
The World Health Organisation added the Moderna jab to the growing list of approved emergency-use vaccines on May 2 as the world struggles with a global supply issue.
The US Food and Drug Administration authorised the emergency use of the Moderna vaccine on December 18, 2020, and the jab has also been authorised for use in Canada, Israel, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore, Qatar, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Brunei. It is currently under review in other countries.
The vaccine, which is administered in two doses, has a reported efficacy of 94.1 per cent after second dose.

It uses the same process as the Pfizer one, taking a genetic snippet for the coronavirus spike protein and protecting it in an oily pod so it can be delivered to our cells.
Our immune system sees the spikes that are then generated as a sign that we’ve been infected and starts its defence, building our response to the real illness.
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has spoken to Health Minister Greg Hunt about a proposal to manufacture Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at a facility in the state. The manufacturing facility in Thebarton, in Adelaide’s inner west, has the capacity to mass produce the mRNA vaccines within 12 months.
Only two vaccines are currently approved for use in Australia — the Pfizer/BioNTech jab and the Oxford/AstraZeneca one.
Australia has delivered only 2.66 million doses of vaccines in a population of more than 25 million people and is currently vaccinating 400,000 people per week.
The rollout has been affected not only by supply issues but by reports of blood clots among people who had received the AstraZeneca jab, with the Pfizer vaccine now the preferred choice for under-50s.

Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face an inquiry into his handling of the pandemic
European economies like France are inching back towards normal thanks to accelerating vaccination schemesSource:AFP
An expert panel on Wednesday blamed bad coordination as well as dithering by national governments and international organisations for the failure to tackle Covid-19 before it became a full-blown pandemic, as India's death toll topped 250,000.
India added a record 4,205 deaths to its Covid-19 toll in the past 24 hours, with the variant stoking the country's surge now present in dozens of other countries across the globe.
Latest figures gathered by AFP from official sources showed almost 160 million confirmed cases worldwide by 1600 GMT Wednesday.
The IPPPR insisted that rich countries should provide one billion vaccines to the world's poorest nations by September 1.
Vaccinations have helped to ease the pandemic crisis in the United States and Europe.
Vaccine frontrunner Britain reported a 2.1-percent jump in GDP in March as it gradually emerges from lockdown.
As governments eye a return to mass travel, Spain said it was hoping to welcome 45 million tourists this year and Germany said it would relax quarantine rules for holidaymakers returning from some EU neighbours.
Bangladesh on Wednesday took delivery of half a million doses from China.
As China's vaccine diplomacy push continues, Senegal also announced it would receive 300,000 doses from Beijing.
But hesitancy is also limiting vaccinations in some parts of the world, with a poll showing that most people in vaccine-sceptical Russia do not want the jab.
For now India is struggling even to count the dead, with many experts saying official figures -- 254,197 killed so far -- may be an underestimate by several times.
There are fears that the virus is now raging in India's vast rural hinterland where two-thirds of the population live, and where health care is patchy.
The European Medicines Agency said Wednesday that there is "promising evidence" that mRNA-based vaccines like those developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech can "neutralise" the new variant -- although it is still monitoring data.
But it has spread to at least 44 nations, the WHO said Tuesday, with Britain detecting the most cases of the variant outside India.
- Olympic doubts -
It used AstraZeneca doses supplied as part of the global Covax programme aimed at boosting immunisation in poorer nations.
Norway on Wednesday said it was dropping AstraZeneca from its vaccination programme, while keeping Johnson & Johnson's jab suspended over similar concerns.
As the nationwide vaccine rollout remains confined to medical workers and the elderly, golf star Hideki Matsuyama became the latest high-level sportsman to express doubts.
Polls show a majority in Japan oppose holding the Games this year.

The catastrophic scale of the Covid-19 pandemic could have been prevented, an independent global panel concluded Wednesday, but a &quot;toxic cocktail&quot; of dithering and poor coordination meant the warning signs went unheeded.
The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response said a series of bad decisions meant Covid-19 went on to kill more than 3.3 million people so far and devastate the global economy.
Early responses to the outbreak detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 "lacked urgency", with February 2020 a costly "lost month" as countries failed to heed the alarm, said the panel.
And the panel also urged the world's wealthiest nations to fund new organisations dedicated to preparing for the next pandemic.
Requested by World Health Organization (WHO) member states last May, the report, "Covid-19: Make it the Last Pandemic", argued that the global alarm system needed overhauling to prevent a similar catastrophe.
"We cannot simply point to one individual who is ultimately responsible," she said.
"Poor strategic choices, unwillingness to tackle inequalities and an uncoordinated system created a toxic cocktail which allowed the pandemic to turn into a catastrophic human crisis."
Sirleaf said: "The world had been warned that this would happen. This should never happen again. This must be the last pandemic to cause destruction on the scale we are witnessing today."
The panel said the WHO could have declared the situation a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) -- its highest level of alarm -- on January 22, 2020.
Nevertheless, given countries' relative inaction, "we might still have ended up in the same place", said former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark, the report's other chairwoman.
As for the initial outbreak, "there were clearly delays in China -- but there were delays everywhere", she added.
G7 industrialised nations should pay 60 percent of the $19 billion ($15 billion euros) required to fund vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics via the WHO's Access to Covid Tools Accelerator programme in 2021, it added.
The WHO and the World Trade Organization should also get major vaccine-producing countries and manufacturers to agree voluntary licensing and technology transfers for Covid-19 vaccines, the panel said.
- Invest billions, save trillions -
The G20 should also create an International Pandemic Financing Facility, able to spend $5-10 billion a year on preparedness, with $50 to $100 billion ready to roll in the event of a crisis.
"Do nations really want to go through all this again?" she asked.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would work with member states "to build a stronger WHO and a healthier, safer, fairer future for all of us".

Norway will drop AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine from its immunisation programme over rare but serious side effects, and keep Johnson &amp; Johnson's jab suspended, the government announced Wednesday.
The vaccine from US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson will still be offered to those who volunteer to take it in Norway. Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a press conference the decision had been taken in view of the rare but serious side effects associated with the jabs, which both use the same adenovirus technology.

An independent report has found the World Health Organisation was too slow in declaring a public health emergency after the emergence of COVID-19 in China.

The WHO commissioned review also claimed "a month of inaction" allowed the disease to spread rapidly. 

It recommended a new global alert system to swiftly address future health threats without the approval of impacted countries. 

The panel also called on wealthy nations to fund vaccines, drugs, and medical supplies for the world.

The damning findings will be debated at a global assembly later this month.

A damning report into the COVID-19 pandemic commissioned by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has concluded that the global disaster could have been avoided.
The independent review found that there were “weak links at every point in the chain of preparedness and response” and gaps in international and national responses “that must be corrected”.
The WHO was “under-powered”, the alert system too slow and “too meek” and global political leadership “absent”, according to the report released on Wednesday by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response.
It said “valuable time was lost” in the early days of the pandemic after the virus was detected in China in December 2019 because international emergency declaration procedures were “much too slow” to prevent the spread of a fast-moving respiratory pathogen.

For a month after the declaration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, the report continued, “too many countries took a ‘wait and see’ approach rather than enacting an aggressive containment strategy that could have forestalled the global pandemic.”
The panel said that a “combination of poor strategic choices, unwillingness to tackle inequalities, and an uncoordinated system created a toxic cocktail which allowed the pandemic to turn into a catastrophic human crisis.”
Panel Co-Chair and former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the current system had “failed to protect us from the COVID-19 pandemic. And if we do not act to change it now, it will not protect us from the next pandemic threat, which could happen at any time.”
“The shelves of storage rooms in the UN and national capitals are full of reports and reviews of previous health crises,” she said. “Had their warnings been heeded, we would have avoided the catastrophe we are in today. This time must be different.”
And the report warned that the world needed an international system “fast” to stop future disease outbreaks from becoming “catastrophic pandemics”. It said that even as countries continue to battle COVID crises, a “new pathogen with pandemic potential could emerge at any time.”

“These gaps in preparedness need urgent rectification,” the report continued.
Calling for urgent reform, the panel said the current system was “clearly unfit” to prevent another infectious pathogen from developing into a pandemic.
“COVID-19 is the 21st century’s Chernobyl moment ... because it has shown so clearly the
gravity of the threat to our health and well-being,” the report said.
“It has caused a crisis so deep and wide that presidents, prime ministers and heads of international and regional bodies must now urgently accept their responsibility to transform the way in which the world prepares for and responds to global health threats.”
Former New Zealand prime minister and panel co-chair Helen Clark said that the panel wanted to make “bold recommendations for change”.
“The tools are available to put an end to the severe illnesses, deaths, and socio-economic damage caused by COVID-19. Leaders have no choice but to act and stop this happening again,” she added.
The panel called for heads of state and government to lead the way in transforming the existing system with forward-looking reforms, including:

Broadcaster Kel Richards says "forward estimates" should be taken with a grain of salt given mathematical projections are "dubious things" by nature, such as projections about the number of COVID-19 deaths in Australia.

"Mathematical projections are never reliable because they can't take into account the unpredictable," he said.

"Projections, in the end, are the art of prophecy."

“We want them to feel confident that it is the right thing to do.

Much needed Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to better protect Australians from COVID-19 could be developed in South Australia.
A locally advanced manufacturing facility in Thebarton, in Adelaide’s inner west, has the capacity to mass produce the mRNA vaccines within 12 months.
For more than 35 years, the 4600 sqm plant was previously used for microbial fermentation by American pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Hospira.
The initiative would run in partnership with biotech giant BioCina, the University of Adelaide and the SA Health and Medical Research Institute.
The Commonwealth will need to approve the plan for it to go ahead.

BioCina purchased the Pfizer biologics manufacturing plant last August.
Its CEO Ian Wisenberg said it was the most advanced facility of its kind in Australia and the only one approved by the US-FDA.
Between the three parties involved, he said the state had the needed elements to begin production “in the short term”.
“We have a state-of-the-art facility that, with reasonable financial support from government to add key capabilities and expand capacity, can within months be producing key ‘ingredients’ of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to address the current global shortage,” Mr Wisenberg said.

The University of Adelaide’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Anton Middelberg said SA would play a key role in accelerating the nation’s COVID-19 vaccination program.
Premier Steven Marshall said he spoke with Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt about the facility but could not say if the federal government would invest in the project.
He said he believed the proposal — introduced about four weeks ago — was a “great opportunity” for local jobs as well as ensuring the nation had effective capability to manufacture vaccinations in future.
“I’m hopeful the federal government will look favourably at working with us to scale up this opportunity,” Mr Marshall said.
“We’d be naive to think this (a global pandemic) wouldn’t happen again in future so having these capabilities, so that we’re not dependant on vaccines coming from overseas, would be very helpful going forward.”

Last month, the Victorian government announced it would fund $50 million into mRNA COVID-19 vaccine production to kickstart domestic manufacturing.
At the time, acting Premier James Merlino said it would take at least a year for the vaccines to be made.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed the announcement and said the Commonwealth would look into what support they could offer.
Australia currently only has the ability to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine domestically, with 50 million doses to be produced by CSL in Melbourne.

Dire budget forecasts about Australian wages for those who have hung on to their jobs have prompted a lashing of the federal government.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has celebrated an improved federal budget deficit off the back of a post-coronavirus jobs boom. Treasury has revealed the post-coronavirus jobs boom will wipe $53 billion from the forecasted budget deficit, lowering the predicted deficit to $161 billion. “We have actually seen our economic position improve since last year’s budget in October and that’s particularly off the back off a stronger labour market with more people in work,” Mr Frydenberg said. “Because when more people are work you see higher tax receipts from their income tax and you see lower welfare payments.”

Aussies who hung on to their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic will now have their real wages cut, federal Labor warns.
The opposition attack came less than 24 hours after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg handed down the federal budget.
The Morrison government’s big-spending agenda was not enough to distract the opposition from grilling them over wage growth figures during question time.
This is because the budget predicts inflation will outstrip wages growth, prompting a cut to real wages.
Inflation is expected to hit 3.5 per cent by the middle of this year, while wages are only forecast to rise 1.25 per cent.
“What is the point of an eight-year-old government racking up $1 trillion of Liberal debt when workers’ wages aren’t keeping up with their bills?” Opposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said.
“Workers who have been lucky enough to hang on their jobs through the pandemic will now have their real wages cut.”
But Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the best way to drive up wages was to lower the unemployment rate.
“In last night’s budget papers, Treasury pointed a forecast for the unemployment rate to go under five (per cent) by the end of next year,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“The key to driving higher wages is a tighter labour market.”

He said real wage figures took into account inflation, which entered negative territory after the government introduced emergency measures such as free childcare in response to COVID-19.
“We have seen pretty modest inflation, so the real wages are at their 10-year average,” Mr Frydenberg said.
He said the government’s additional investment in skills, tax relief and infrastructure would help to drive more Australians into jobs.
“This budget will help to create more than 250,000 more jobs by the end of 2022-23,” Mr Frydenberg said in his budget speech.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack was also questioned over the government’s $10bn infrastructure investment, with opposition infrastructure spokeswoman Catherine King saying the budget papers showed a $3.3bn cut over the next four years.
“The only cut I have seen this week was the haircut I got the other day,” Mr McCormack said, prompting the chamber to erupt with laughter.

Tougher new measures involving undercover police officers will be put in place to stop wrongdoers from ignoring COVID-19 directions.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the QR code system used in New South Wales enables rapid contact tracing which has allowed state residents greater freedom during the pandemic. She described the QR code system as an “extra weapon” which could be used to manage COVID-19 effectively when clusters emerge. “From feedback I’ve received no other state in Australia has a system like ours and that’s why we can do things a bit differently,&quot; she said.

Tougher measures are being put in place by South Australian police to stamp out complacency surrounding the use of QR codes.
Operation Trace — which will begin on Thursday — will see plain clothed police officers on the look out for wrongdoers skipping past COVID-19 check-ins at a number of businesses, like supermarkets and restaurants.
Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said SA police had long taken an educational approach to QR codes but expected the community to understand the requirements by now.
He said the state currently has about 1 million people checking in daily, with officers checking up on about 100 businesses during that same time period.

“We are seeing a level of complacency regarding COVID-19 check-ins and now is not the time to stop,” he said.
“If you speak to any person in the street, they'll tell you about their observations regarding people simply walking past those QR codes.
“SA has done very well so far … these steps have been taken to make sure that if we do have an outbreak in South Australia, SA Health are in the best position to respond and minimise the likelihood of us having to move to more harsh restrictions as a result.
“The outbreak from SA’s medical hotel is a great reminder to us that whilst this particular individual travelled to Victoria, they could just as easily have moved back into the SA community.”
The Commissioner — who is also the State Coordinator for coronavirus — said he anticipated “a large number” of people to be spoken to during the operation.
He said the undercover officers would have their identification to prove they were legitimate officers when speaking to wrongdoers.
SA Police also have a mechanism in place that keeps track of all people that have been spoken to in order to assess their level of compliance.

“My hope is that they'll go home and talk to their friends and relatives about the fact that they were stopped and spoken to by police.
“Hopefully the message will move through the community that we take this seriously and it's important that people do the right thing.”
Commissioner Stevens could not provide an exact number of officers that would be deployed under the task force because it depended on the number of officers needed for other operational demands.
But, he warned police were making a concerted effort to visit as many places on a random basis as possible.
Trace officers will also remind businesses of their requirement to make QR codes as well as a hard copy signing process readily available to all customers.
Under current laws, individuals found to breach COVID-19 directions can be slapped with a $1060 fine while businesses can cop a $5060 expiation.
The operation will run from May 13-21 but the Commissioner said it could be extended.

Australians don’t know when they will be vaccinated after mixed messages from the government, and it’s all based on one central budget assumption.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Scott Morrison continues to 'sledge members of the Opposition' instead of answering questions, during a heated debate over the vaccine rollout in Question Time. Shadow Health Minister Mark Butler quizzed the prime minister in relation to the federal government's promises for the number of coronavirus doses Australians will have received by the end of the year, however Mr Morrison said the budget papers 'make no reference' to first or second doses. 'I've been very clear in the medical advice that we've received that we are working as quickly as we can together with the states and territories to ensure we get as many Australians vaccinated as quickly as possible,' Mr Morrison said. 'It's the next day after the budget, and as we come to this despatch box and talk about economic plans, we get questions from the shadow health minister, the shadow treasurer.' Labor leader Anthony Albanese, on a point of order, accused the prime minister of sledging members of the opposition 'rather than answer questions'. 'Secondly, on relevance, if the prime minister doesn't understand that the vaccine rollout affects the economy, then I'm not quite sure how we can explain that to him.' Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt quieted the opposition's vaccine rollout concerns, saying the assumption is 'for a whole of population vaccination program'. 'And the difference between a first and second shot of Pfizer - which is what we're doing in the final quarter - is three weeks,' Mr Hunt said. 'So if you have the whole of the population during the course of the year, if those people who complete their vaccination by the ninth of December, they will be done this year. 'And if there are those that occur in the last few days of the year, then by definition those three weeks will occur on the other side of the calendar.'

The deadline for when all Australians will receive their COVID-19 vaccines remains unclear after mixed messages from the nation’s top leaders.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday delivered a free-spending federal budget based on the assumption a “population-wide vaccination program is likely to be in place by the end of the year”.
Mr Frydenberg told reporters on Tuesday: “The assumption is that every Australian who wants to get two shots of the vaccine (will be able to) by the end of the year.”
The comments came after Finance Minister Simon Birmingham told the ABC he expected “some Australians will still be getting vaccinated next year”.
And during question time on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison moved to ensure the government was not pinned to the treasurer’s timeline, insisting the measure was “not a policy commitment” from the Coalition.
“It is a Treasury assumption that has been put in place and it makes no reference, I note, to second doses. It only refers to doses,” he said.

Labor health spokesman Mark Butler accused Mr Morrison of failing to give a “clear answer” on when Australians would be vaccinated.
“If the budget’s assumptions aren’t based on policy settings, what are they based on?” he said.
Labor treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said the government had used “weasel words” to avoid being held to a specific timetable.
“The prime minister has been out and about this morning, we are none the wiser on what his assumptions are about the rollout of this vaccine,” he said.
“It’s been one humiliation after another when it comes to the Prime Minister and vaccinations.”
Vaccination targets have proved a vexed issue for the government since revelations the AstraZeneca jab was not advised for people under 50.
AstraZeneca had been set to make up the bulk of Australia’s rollout, with 50 million doses to be produced in Melbourne.
But April’s development saw the Coalition abandon all vaccination targets, as the prime minister warned “you don’t get to set the agenda” during COVID-19.
Mr Morrison was then forced to walk back a claim from Trade Minister Dan Tehan, who said the government aimed to offer a first dose to all Australians by the end of the year.
“The government has also not set, nor has any plans to set any new targets for completing first doses,” Mr Morrison said.
“While we would like to see these doses completed before the end of the year, it is not possible to set such targets given the many uncertainties involved.”

Zero cases is the daily statistic all Australians long to hear of, while one case sends us into panic. It’s a strange reaction and it has to stop.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

COMMENT
So that’s it then, Australia’s borders are closed until mid-2022.
On page 36 of budget paper 1 was the bad news for anyone with a family overseas: “Inbound and international travel is expected to remain low through to mid-2022”.
Almost 30 per cent of Australians are first generation immigrants, many with parents overseas.
With a resigned sigh, some of those are now considering leaving jobs and homes here and emigrating back from whence they came. They don’t want to, but if the choice is between Australia and seeing elderly parents, some will choose the latter.
Much of the border barricading appears to be down one number: zero, and its irresistible allure. It’s an almost unique and bizarre Australian phenomenon.

Not zero, but actually kinda zero
The depressing budget forecast came days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison was reported as saying borders would be closed “indefinitely” as there was a “target of zero cases”. He later said he’d been “misreported” and there was no “zero” target.
But he did say vaccinated people might only be allowed to travel if there was “clear evidence that this prevents transmissibility”.
Official policy or not, that sounds a lot like a strategy to ensure zero — or near zero — COVID-19 cases cross the border and get out into the community.
That might make sense right now; no one is suggesting the frontier should be flung open a week next Tuesday. It will no longer make sense if, down the line, vaccines do their job and serious cases of COVID plummet.
Closed borders will then look less like a health measure, and more like a political ploy.
BAD NEWS ON BORDERS - page 36, Budget Paper No 1 for those who want to hit the books https://t.co/YCamLCYNHP@newscomauHQpic.twitter.com/70Ck8NJ2Ak
Australia has fetishised zero cases. We’ve become intoxicated by our virus success. A single positive case in the community can send a city into panicked lockdown and lead to supermarket shelves being stripped.
Conversely, we love a doughnut day; even better a double doughnut day, of no cases in the community or in quarantine.
Australia’s success at almost entirely keeping COVID out is remarkable. No one wanted to go through the pain that the UK endured as it fumbled through the first months of the pandemic.
We’ve rewarded premiers who have promised the most hardline COVID approach with landslide election victories. The PM now appears to have taken note with it looking very possible borders will remain essentially shut until after the 2022 federal election, which could be as late as September of next year.
Keeping the frontier closed during 2022 is about fear: fear of more than zero cases, and fear of losing the election.
If you’re the PM, why would you risk easing the border open beyond New Zealand if you’ll get slammed by voters for a single case crossing the threshold? Even if, after we’re vaccinated, it might cause very little harm?

Australia’s bizarre fascination with zero cases
Zero cases is a potent drug.
Like all drugs it has harmful side effects. Not just for families but for the tourism, hospitality and transport industries who will miss out on international visitors if the border remains closed for longer than necessary. Businesses will shut, jobs will be lost.
Zero might soothe us now, but this drug could lead to a collective madness about borders if we demand they remain shut even after we’re jabbed. Zero is a drug we will have to wean ourselves off once most of us are vaccinated. But why get vaccinated, some might ponder, if there’s no prospect of travel? Easier just to let zero keep us safe.

How we should judge COVID success
In March, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said case numbers should be replaced by hospitalisation rates as the future metric to judge COVID success by.
“Zero community transmissions are easy to achieve when we’ve got no international travel,” she told radio station 2GB.
“We need to change our measure or we will be left behind as a nation if we don’t think about travelling internationally.
“What is a good measure of success is keeping people alive and keeping them out of hospital.”

Zero may never be achieved globally. What then?
Earlier this year, journal Nature commented on the “coronavirus-free” life of Western Australia. For the globe, however, WA was merely a “beautiful dream,” an “improbable” model of what will likely never be elsewhere.
Many scientists now believe COVID-19 will become endemic. That is, it won’t be eradicated and will continue to circulate but vaccines will have a double effect: infections will drop and those that do catch the virus will have a far less serious condition. Booster jabs and shots adapted for new variants will be the norm.
For most nations, reducing COVID transmission to low levels with few if any serious cases is the target — not zero.
We don’t yet know if that will come to pass. But the signs from countries with high rates of inoculation are promising.
In the UK, where 27 per cent of people are fully vaccinated, 2000 cases a day are being recorded. Sounds a lot — but that’s down from a high of 67,000 in a single day in January. On Monday, no one died of COVID-19 in England, and that’s with three quarters of the population still yet to get there full dose.
Israel has vaccinated 56 per cent of its residents. It had 43 cases yesterday and zero deaths. Fully vaxxed Bhutan has had one death – throughout the whole pandemic.
If, in a few months’ time, countries like Israel and the UK are continuing to see some cases but few hospitalisations, Australia will have to question its zero cases fixation.
Hell London, at some point in 2022, 2023, who knows? (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)Source:Getty Images
Australia’s sluggish vaccine rollout means it could indeed take until 2022 to vaccinate everyone. But if it picks up the pace and many Aussies, including those most at risk, get jabbed earlier, what then?
The single-minded focus on zero cases alone will become harder to justify as more people get their AstraZeneca or Pfizer shot.
Fully vaccinated Aussies will begin to ask why vaccinated Brits and Israelis, Americans and Spaniards, can jet off to see family but they can’t. Zero could mean people’s grandmas and grandpas, mothers and fathers will die needlessly separated from their Aussie loved ones, with last goodbyes done via Zoom.
The reality is the rest of the world may never get to zero cases but will carry on, just with far fewer people falling ill. If Australia insists on zero cases, we’ll carry on too, just with borders closed indefinitely and immigrants making heartbreaking decisions about whether to stay or go.

Queensland has fumed about the share of funding among the states but there’s another ‘glaring omission’ bothering Premier Palaszczuk.
From single parents to families and the elderly: These are the winners and losers in this year's budget cash splash from the government.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg handed down the federal budget on Tuesday night. Picture: Sam Mooy/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images
The “most glaring omission” in the federal budget was the refusal to commit to a regional quarantine plan, the Queensland premier says, accusing the Morrison government of failing to provide “safety and certainty” against the health and economic impacts of COVID-19.
Annastacia Palaszczuk has continued to lobby the commonwealth to build purpose-built facilities to accommodate returning travellers, proposing a centre in Toowoomba.
The 1000-bed site would be based on the outskirts of the regional city, with similar facilities dotted across the country as a solution for the continued failings of centrally-based hotel quarantines.
“In this ongoing age of COVID, there are two things Australia needs: safety and certainty,” Ms Palaszczuk told state parliament on Wednesday.
“Regional quarantine is our last best hope for both.
“Returning stranded Australians from overseas, plugging the gaps in the labour market, the return of foreign students, the return of international travel – all these problems are solved with regional quarantine.”

The Premier reiterated her criticism of the Morrison government, who she said was constitutionally responsible for quarantine but it was being “shouldered by the states”.
“Our hotels were never designed for long-term quarantine,” she said.
“Last night, the budget revealed international borders will not open for another year.
“That’s another Christmas before families see each other again.
“Regional quarantine reunites families sooner.”
The pointed criticism comes after Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said the budget was a “rotten rip-off” based on the previously reported $1.6bn of transport infrastructure investment allocated to the Sunshine State compared to $3.3bn and $3bn for NSW and Victoria respectively.
He said this share of investment ignored the pressures of population growth, with migration adding 30,000 residents to Queensland last year, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics, compared to population losses of 19,000 and 13,000 in NSW and Victoria respectively.
“Tonight, we have learned the truth – only $807.5 million of that supposed $1.6 billion, barely half of the amount promised - is in this budget,” he said on Tuesday night.
“Scott Morrison is holding Queenslanders to ransom, saying they’d have to vote for him in at least two more elections before we’d see the money he promised.”

Queensland’s chief health officer has allayed fears Qantas ground staff were forced to come into close contact with a COVID-positive traveller.
New South Wales Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has reiterated calls for a roadmap to open Australia up to the rest of the world. “There’s still no clear roadmap or strategy to get there and I think that needs to be communicated more clearly,” Mr Perrottet told Sky News. “It’s a difficult conversation because we will be one of the few countries in the world that will be opening up and letting the virus in but at that point in time you’d want to have the majority of the population vaccinated. He said it’s not only important for the government but for businesses and citizens. “Unless we set those targets, even if we fall short, at less there is a direction that we know we’re heading.”

A traveller who arrived from Papua New Guinea posed “no risk” to airport staff, Queensland’s chief health officer says, after reports emerged ground employees were told to “open the door and run”.
The Courier Mail reported on Wednesday that Qantas staff had described the arrival of Air Niugini flight PX003 on May 7 as an “absolute cock up”.
They were reportedly told there was a COVID-positive passenger on board, which has since been vehemently denied by health authorities.
A Qantas spokesman confirmed to NCA NewsWire that Brisbane Airport had been alerted 30 minutes prior to the flight’s arrival that there was a “potential case on board”.

However, Jeannette Young said the man in question had fully recovered from the virus and would not have been allowed to fly if he had been positive.
“The good thing that we’ve seen in Queensland is that everyone has been very cautious … That has stood us well,” Dr Young said.
“There was no need for this to have happened. This was a fully recovered, historic case - that’s why he was given permission to travel to Australia.
“Anyone who tests positive before getting on a plane is not allowed to travel until they are fully recovered.
“I do not criticise the airport or anyone there for taking an ultra-cautious approach … but they do not need to have been concerned. He was fully recovered.”

The Qantas spokesman said there were a “number of strict procedures in place for managing aircraft arriving from overseas”.
“Qantas ground staff followed all procedures,” he said.
Fully decked in PPE, Qantas ground staff were instructed to open the doors and leave the area, as is standard procedure, and had no contact with anyone inside the plane.
The aircraft was taken over by health and border authorities, in line with protocol.
Dr Young said while the man concerned did not have the virus, “we do not know that anyone else on that plane did not have COVID”.
“There could always be a positive case on that plane … We need to treat every single person on one of those flights from PNG, or anywhere, as potentially being infectious,” she said.
“This particular individual did not cause any risk, but there might have been others who did.”
The man is currently in hotel quarantine, where he will serve the mandatory 14 days.
Queensland recorded three new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, all overseas acquired and in hotel quarantine.

Victorian authorities have confirmed a Melbourne man was likely infected with coronavirus in a South Australian quarantine hotel.
Victoria has recorded no new locally acquired coronavirus cases despite the positive case which was reported in the state on Tuesday. The man in his 30s returned to Australia from India via Singapore and the Maldives in late April and undertook two weeks of hotel quarantine in South Australia. Health authorities believe the man contracted COVID while he was in quarantine despite testing negative at three stages during his stay because someone in the room adjacent had tested positive to the virus. The question remains as to how the virus was able to escape the room or whether the two people somehow came into contact. The man flew home to Victoria on May 4, began displaying symptoms of COVID on May 8 and had a COVID test on May 10. People arriving in Sydney from the Greater Melbourne area will have to complete a declaration form from today confirming they have not attended any potential exposure sites in the previous 14 days.

Victorian authorities have confirmed a Melbourne man who tested positive for COVID-19 likely caught the illness in a hotel quarantine facility in South Australia.
Officials have made contact with hundreds of thousands of Melburnians in an attempt to narrow down the risk of a COVID-19 spread after the man visited multiple venues across the city.
So far, 84 of the man’s primary close contacts have been identified and all are isolating for 14 days, Victoria’s COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar told the Seven Network on Wednesday night.
Of those, 44 have already tested negative.
“We’re hoping to see other results coming through for the rest of today and tomorrow and over the next few days,” Mr Weimar added.
The man tested positive to the virus following 14 days in hotel quarantine in South Australia, before flying to Melbourne and spending time in the community. The man tested negative for COVID-19 on day 1, 5 and 13 but a positive case was detected in the room next to him on the day the man left quarantine.
A Wednesday afternoon statement by Victoria’s Department of Health and Human Services said genomic sequencing results have come back and “support the hypothesis that the Victorian case acquired COVID-19 in an interstate hotel quarantine facility”.
It means Victoria hasn’t had a locally acquired case of COVID-19 in 75 days.
SA Chief Public Health Officer Professor Nicola Spurrier said the results confirmed the Victorian case was linked to a case in the Tom’s Court hotel in Adelaide.
She said investigations are ongoing, but those on level three of the hotel will have to quarantine for a further 14 days “out of an abundance of caution”.

Twelve exposure sites have been identified including two Tier 1 sites.
A CBD Indian restaurant, domestic Jetstar flight, Altona packing shed and Craigieburn and Flinders St stations were all listed among the most at-risk locations in Victoria following news of the case.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said on Wednesday the government had contacted people who lived in Melbourne’s northern and eastern suburbs, with testing also ramping up in those areas.
“We’ve sent out 396,000 text messages to communities who live near the exposures sites to get tested,” Mr Foley said.
“We’ve also increased the hours across every single one of our testing facilities and we’ve seen already this morning quite a strong surge in demand.”

Mr Foley said 18 patrons at Melbourne’s Curry Vault Indian Restaurant and Bar had been tested, with a further 14 contacted and three of those returning negative tests so far.
Only 18 had checked in under the QR code system when the man was there but up to 40 diners were in the restaurant at the time.
A further 17 close contacts at Pact Retail Accessories in Altona North also received tests.
The man’s three household contacts were in isolation and had all returned negative tests so far, Mr Foley said.
The state reported no new local cases as of Tuesday evening.
“Yesterday we tested 21,461 Victorians, that’s a very good figure and we’ve established more testing facilities in the northern and eastern suburbs based on a list of exposure sites,” Mr Foley said.

Contact tracers are also working to contact hundreds of Victorians who had travelled to and from Craigieburn and Flinders St stations on May 7, following an AFL game.
“We are working with both Metro services and the AFL, given it was the aftermath of the Richmond and Geelong game,” Mr Foley said.
“We’re working to get that message out through their clubs and get that message out to what we expect would be many hundreds of people on that train.”
Passengers who were on the man’s Jetstar flight JQ771 from Adelaide to Melbourne had also been contacted, but Mr Foley said the risk of transmission on the flight was low.
“We’ve sent messages to those people to please come forward and get tested,” he said.
“We think the likelihood of that flight being an acquisition flight is improbably, but this is out of an abundance of caution.”

The infected Victorian man, in his 30s, returned to Australia from India on April 19.
The man returned to his Wollert home in Victoria on May 4, and developed symptoms four days later.
He was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Tuesday, sparking a “full public health response”.
Hundreds of Victorians have been ordered to isolate after the man visited locations in Epping, Altona North and the CBD between Thursday and Saturday last week.
Alerts were issued on ­Tuesday for exposure sites in Melbourne’s CBD, Epping and Altona North between ­Thursday and Saturday last week.
Three of the man’s primary household primary contacts had returned a negative test result.
No new Victorian restrictions were foreshadowed on Tuesday, but authorities have urged people to follow the health advice, including wearing masks inside.
Amid the scare, Mr Foley said Victorians and businesses were getting lazy with QR codes, which made it easier for contact tracers to track any potential exposure sites.
He said there were challenges in tracking those who visited the CBD restaurant as customers had not properly been implementing the use of the QR system at the site.
“This is a reminder that the quality and speed of the public health response is directly linked to record keeping that operators and customers use in the facilities,” Mr Foley said.
“The most important thing you can do when you come to a restaurant or facility is to check in.”

Temporary restrictions have been in place since a recent COVID-19 case, but Gladys Berejiklian has hinted when she’ll make a call on their end.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Sky News he is not looking at the election and is instead focused on fighting the pandemic which is raging across the world. “People who focus on politics will do that, but as prime minister I have to focus on the pandemic and Australians out there, that’s what they’re focused on,” he said. “The only thing I’m fighting in the pandemic, to secure people’s health and to secure their jobs.”

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has hinted at easing the restrictions that came into effect last week to deal with the state’s first locally acquired COVID-19 case in more than a month.
A man aged in his 50s and his wife, from Sydney’s eastern suburbs, became the first community transmitted cases of the virus in NSW since early April when they tested positive last week.
It prompted the state government to reintroduce restrictions including mandatory mask wearing in indoor places such as public transport and a limit of 20 visitors to households.
The rules remain in place until midnight on Monday.
However, with NSW recording five consecutive days of no local cases since the two cases were revealed, Ms Berejiklian suggested the restrictions would not be extended.
“We can't predict the health advice that we’ll get, but obviously every day that goes by with zero cases means the health experts will feel more confident to let us go back to what we had (before) last Thursday,” she told reporters on Wednesday at Martin Place.
“When clusters emerge, what we don’t know is how many clusters we prevented and I just want to thank everybody throughout Greater Sydney for sticking to the (restrictions) we’ve put in place.
“I look forward to getting the (health) advice over the weekend as to what will happen on Monday morning.
“I’m always optimistic, but I have to say I’m very comfortable about how (case numbers) are going. But we will continue to monitor what’s happening across other states as well.”

Ms Berejiklian’s last comment was in relation to a potential COVID-19 cluster in Melbourne, where a surprise new COVID-19 case was recorded on Tuesday.
A man in his 30s tested positive after arriving home to Melbourne after completing 14 days hotel quarantine in South Australia, sparking fears about how he contracted the disease.
He had tested negative four times during his stay at Adelaide’s Playford Hotel.
Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton said the man had returned to Australia from India on April 19, but most likely caught the virus in hotel quarantine.
“People arriving in NSW from the greater Melbourne area from 6am on Wednesday must complete a declaration which confirms they have not attended a venue of concern,” NSW Health officials said in a statement.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has touted the federal government’s massive spending budget saying they must continue to spend responsibly to ensure Australia doesn’t walk back in its COVID-19 recovery. 

“We’ve moved passed the immediate emergency phase and now we’re into that recovery phase,” he told Sky News. 

“We will spend responsibly but we have to spend to ensure that we keep this recovery on track.”

He pointed to the JobKeeper program, saying it was “the single biggest economic support the country has ever seen … but we also knew when to turn it off”. 

“See in our government we know when to do it and we know when to stop it and right now we need to keep leaning in, particularly with infrastructure and skills and the digital economy and workforce support. 

“All of this needs to continue so our recovery can continue.” 

Asked what he would of thought of the current numbers 12 months ago, the prime minister said he would have called it “heroic”. 

“This is what Australians have achieved,” Mr Morrison said.

A furious Tom Cruise screamed at crew members in a shocking clip that leaked several months ago. Now, he’s broken his silence about the scandal.
Actor Tom Cruise has been recorded yelling at Mission Impossible crew members for not following social distancing protocols.

Back in December, leaked audio of Tom Cruise ranting about the importance of COVID-19 safety protocols on his Mission: Impossible 7 set went viral.
Now, the 58-year-old actor/producer is addressing why he felt the need to say what he said.
“I said what I said,” Cruise told Empire magazine. “There was a lot at stake at that point. But it wasn’t my entire crew. I had the crew leave the set, and it was just select people.”

Cruise went on to explain how filming was “never shut down again” despite the pandemic. “And here we are, continuing to film.
“All those emotions were going through my mind,” he added. “And for the whole crew to know that we’d started rolling on a movie was just a huge relief … It was very emotional.”
On the audio, Cruise can be heard yelling about crew members reportedly not following social distancing rules.

“If I see you do it again, you’re f***ing gone. And if anyone in this crew does it, that’s it – and you too and you too. And you, don’t you ever f***ing do it again,” he said. “They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherf***ers.”
“That’s it. No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their f***ing homes because our industry is shut down,” Cruise continued. “We are not shutting this f***ing movie down. Is it understood? If I see it again, you’re f***ing gone.”
Cruise claimed at the time that he was in close contact with studios, insurance companies and producers to set what he called a “gold standard” of filming amid the pandemic.
In September, Forbes reported that Cruise paid $US700,000 ($A893,000) for the cast and crew of the film to live on cruise ships in hopes of creating a safe bubble for the team to work in order to thwart any risk of a breakout.

Finance Minister Simon Birmingham says the federal government is engaged in negotiations with global pharmaceutical companies to bring their mRNA vaccine technology to Australia. 

He told Sky News there was money "baked" in the “bottom line” of the budget to invest in onshore manufacturing of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, however, the government has not yet detailed the costs. 

"It's part of the contingency reserve in the budget, we just don't to publish those figures because obviously we want to negotiate the best possible deal for the taxpayers," he said. 

“There are two very sensitive commercial negotiations that have to be pursued there, the first is with the holders of the vaccine technology, companies like Pfizer or Moderna. And the second is then with those you negotiate to establish a production facility here. 

“We certainly welcome state partnerships to the table, what we’ve been doing already and are continuing to do is negotiate with those global pharmaceutical companies to get the technology transferred to Australia. 

“There’s no point just saying here’s a bucket of money to have a manufacturing facility in Australia, you’ve actually got to go back to first principles here and get those tech companies to bring it to the country in the first place. 

“This is not about the immediate … but there is an expectation that there may need to be boosters over the long term."

Finance Minister Simon Birmingham says Australia is the only country in the developed world to see more people in work today than before the pandemic.

"We've been able to - because of the management through the COVID crisis - to get to a point where we're seeing strong economic growth," he said.

"We're the only country across the developed world to be in that position where we've actually got more people back in work pre-pandemic. Everybody else is still struggling to get back to that starting point. 

"That has given us the window of opportunity to be able to invest in our aged care services, in our mental health services, in careful, targeted ways, but in ways that keep our net debt lower than forecasted in our last budget."

Net debt is expected to climb to $980.6 billion by 2024/25.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced students will need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend classes in person at the State University of New York and the City University of New York.

“No excuses – SUNY and CUNY boards will require vaccinations for all in-person students coming back to school in the fall,” he said.

“You're a young person, you go to a SUNY school, State University of New York, City University of New York, you must have a vaccine to come back in September.

“If you must have a vaccine, get it now if you have to get it anyway.”

Mr Cuomo also encouraged private schools and universities to mimic the requirement.

The mandate comes as Mr Cuomo attempts to boost the uptake in two groups with low vaccination rates, branded the “youthful” and the “doubtful”, 

“Let’s make a global statement – you cannot go back to school, in-person in September, unless you have a vaccine,” he said.

“That will be a major motivation for people to get the vaccine, and if you have to get it by September you may as well get it now, why wouldn’t you get it now?”

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has delivered this year’s federal budget, addressing Australia’s most pressing issues and how the government aims to tackle them.

The treasurer spoke on Australia’s economic situation amid COVID-19, declaring the nation is “coming back” despite net debt increasing to $617.5 billion and the deficit being set to hit $161 billion.

He announced almost 500,000 jobs have been created and outlined the federal government’s plan to secure economic recovery and “build for the future”.

An additional $15 billion for infrastructure commitments was announced, to go along with the government’s 10-year $110 billion infrastructure program.

Speaking on the Royal Commission into Aged care Quality and Safety, Mr Frydenberg committed $17.7 billion in targeted and practical new funding to “significantly improve the system”.

He emphasised the issue of mental health, labelling it a “clear national priority," touting the federal government’s spending on the area.

“We have nearly doubled spending on mental health since we came to government,” Mr Frydenberg said.

The federal government is also “playing its part” on climate change, having met the nation’s 2020 commitments and being on track to “meet and beat” the 2030 target.

“Australia is on the pathway to zero, and our goal is to get there as soon as we possibly can,” he said.

According to Mr Frydenberg, Australia is seeing jobs and the economy come back very strongly.

“And this budget will ensure we come back even stronger and ensure that we secure Australia’s economic recovery.”

From tax cuts and childcare to education and COVID-19 vaccines, here’s everything you need to know about the budget at a glance.
A budget for everyone, but this time the government mean it.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has unveiled another massive-spending budget aimed at locking in Australia’s pandemic recovery – and it’s got something for just about everyone.
With an eye-watering deficit of $161 billion and a national debt heading towards $1 trillion, Mr Frydenberg has made no apologies for the “significant and unavoidable cost” of digging the country out of its first recession in three decades.
From tax cuts for middle Australia and childcare subsidies for busy families, to sweeteners for the “tradie and the truckie and the teacher and the nurse”, Mr Frydenberg’s second budget in six months throws in everything but the kitchen sink.
“Australia’s economic recovery is now well underway and we must keep the momentum going,” the Treasurer said in his budget speech to parliament on Tuesday night.
“This budget secures the recovery and sets Australia up for the future. Tax cuts to put more money in people’s pockets. Business incentives to unleash a further wave of investment. New apprenticeships and training places to get more Australians into work. A $110 billion infrastructure pipeline to build our nation’s future. And record funding to guarantee the essential services Australians rely on. Jobs are coming back. The economy is coming back. Australia is coming back.”
Here’s your five-minute guide with everything you need to know.

Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has declared Australia is “coming back” despite the COVID-19 recession being set to see net debt increase to $617.5 billion, and the deficit hit $161 billion.

“In the face of a once-in-a-century pandemic the Australian spirit has shone through,” he said.

“Team Australia at its best, a nation to be proud of.”

Mr Frydenberg spoke of Australia’s unemployment rates throughout the course of the pandemic, noting Treasury had feared unemployment could reach 15 per cent and the economy could contract by more than 20 per cent.

“Today, the reality is different,” he said.

“Ahead of any major advanced economy, Australia has seen employment go above its pre-pandemic levels – at 5.6 per cent, unemployment today is lower than when we came to government.”

The Treasurer also pointed to the success of the JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs, which were made possible because “we entered this crisis from a position of economic strength”.

“But it has come at a significant and unavoidable cost,” Mr Frydenberg said.

“The COVID-19 recession will see our deficit reach $161 billion this year – falling to $57 billion in 2024-25.

“Net debt will increase to $617.5 billion or 30 per cent of GDP this year, and peak at $980.6 billion or 40.9 per cent of GDP in June 2025.”

Mr Frydenberg said this is “low by international standards” and Australia is better placed than “nearly any other country in the world” to meet the economic challenges which lie ahead.

“Our plan is working,” he said.

“Australia’s economic engine is roaring back tonight.”

The Treasurer has sent the state premiers a message after handing down a budget that makes a big call on when all Aussies will be able to get the jab.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has outlined the Morrison government's plan to &quot;secure Australia's economic recovery&quot; and its plan to &quot;build for the future,&quot; in his budget address on Tuesday evening. Mr Frydenberg said it is a plan that &quot;continues to protect Australians from COVID&quot;. &quot;A plan that creates more jobs. A plan that guarantees the essential services and a plan that builds a more resilient and secure Australia&quot;. &quot;It is a plan that is guided by our enduring values - reward for effort, the power of persuasion and aspiration and enterprise, upholding personal responsibility and always providing a helping hand to those who need it&quot;. &quot;This is what the Coalition stands for&quot;. The treasurer said in this budget, a further $1.9 billion is allocated to the rollout of vaccines in the country.

State premiers have been told to keep their heads during future COVID-19 outbreaks, as the Treasurer warns Australia’s economic recovery depends on suppressing the virus.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unveiled a big-spending budget on Tuesday aimed at accelerating Australia’s post-COVID recovery, painting an optimistic picture of vaccination rates over the next 12 months.
The budget assumes that snap COVID closures will still occur over the next six months, but not the extend of the extended lockdown Victoria endured last year.
Speaking ahead of his third budget as Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg warned “our economic recovery does depend on our successful suppression of the virus”.
He conceded COVID-19 made predicting the coming months an inexact science, but urged state and territory leaders not to overreact to minor clusters.
“We don’t know what is around the corner with respect to the virus. The assumption is that there will be new cases,” he said.
“My message to the premiers is, of course, have a proportionate response when outbreaks occur.”

A record 402,000 Australians were vaccinated last week, taking the country’s total to 2.7m since the rollout began, though immunisation rates remained well below the government’s initial estimates.
Embedded in the budget assumptions was a “population-wide vaccination program” likely to be in place by the end of the year, but Mr Frydenberg conceded not all Australians were “lining up” to be immunised.
“It is difficult business making assumptions such as this in the middle of a pandemic,” he said.
“The assumption is that every Australian who wants will get two shots of the vaccine (will be able to) by the end of the year.”
Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday Australians should consider the international border reopening as an incentive to get vaccinated, after the government came under pressure to reveal its timeline.
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said reopening the international border was of “utmost importance”, but warned it would require vigilance from the states.
“That requires us to also make sure the states and territories maintain their successful regimes — testing, tracing and isolating,” he said.

Anyone in Tasmania who has been in high-risk Victorian locations should isolate immediately following a new case of COVID-19.
The World Health Organisation has classified the coronavirus variant first found in India as a “concern at the global level”. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, said while early research indicated the B. 1.617 variant has an increased transmission rate there was no evidence that vaccines don’t work against it. “We don’t have anything to suggest that our diagnostics, our therapeutics and our vaccines don’t work,” she said. “We will continue to see variants emerge, we will continue to see variants of concern around the world, and we must do everything we can to really limit the spread. “Even though there is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies, we need much more information about this virus variant in this lineage in all of the sub-lineages, so we need more sequencing, targeted sequencing to be done.”
TASMANIA has declared a number of Victorian locations as high-risk following a case of COVID-19 in a recently returned traveller who had completed quarantine.
Deputy Director of Public Health, Dr Julie Graham, said effective from 12.01am Wednesday, 12 May anyone who had been in those locations needed to isolate.
“This decision has been made in response to an announcement by Victoria of a case of COVID-19 in a recently returned traveller who had completed 14 days quarantine in South Australia.
“Authorities in both Victoria and South Australia are investigating the source of the infection.
“Anyone who arrived in Tasmania from Victoria on or after 5 May has been contacted
and advised to review the list of high-risk premises.”
The locations are in the areas of Altona North and Epping.

“Anyone who has been at these sites at the time and date specified is required to isolate immediately and call the Public Health Hotline … for further advice and to arrange testing.
“A person who intends to travel to Tasmania who has been at a high-risk premises at the dates and times specified will not be permitted to enter Tasmania unless approved by the Deputy State Controller as an Essential Traveller.
“The list of high-risk premises may change as the Victoria public health response progresses and it should be checked regularly by anyone who has recently been in Victoria.
Dr Graham said anyone with cold or flu symptoms, even mild should contact the Public
Health Hotline on 1800 671 738 to arrange a test.
Further advice will be issued as Victorian authorities continue contact tracing. Visit www.coronavirus.tas.gov.au for the latest Tasmanian information and a list of these premises.

States have reacted after Victoria recorded a new case of COVID-19, with some people being told to go into quarantine.

Travellers who have recently returned to Western Australia from Victoria have been warned they must get tested for COVID-19 immediately after an outbreak of the virus in the eastern state.
It comes after a man aged in his 30s tested positive for coronavirus in Melbourne after completing 14 days of quarantine in a South Australian hotel.
Western Australia has been criticised by some for slamming its border shut whenever there has been an outbreak in another jurisdiction, but health authorities have been slowly moving away from that method.
The health department has issued an alert, saying anyone who has been to exposure sites in Victoria at the specified times should get tested immediately for COVID-19 and quarantine for 14 days from the date of exposure.
The case was likely infectious from May 6 to 10, Western Australia's chief health officer Andy Robertson said in a statement.

Anyone who has travelled to the state from Victoria is also urged to monitor the Victorian Health website for exposure locations as contact tracing continues.
“We believe any risk to WA remains very low,” Dr Robertson said.
“However, the situation highlights the importance of remaining vigilant to prevent any spread of the virus or community transmission in this state.
“We will continue to monitor the situation in Victoria very closely and issue updated health advice if required.”

Meanwhile, Queensland health authorities are warning anyone who has been to an exposure site — who is already in Queensland or will enter Queensland before 1am on Thursday — must call 134 COVID and immediately travel by private transport then quarantine for 14 days.
Anyone arriving in Queensland after that date must undertake mandatory hotel quarantine for two weeks.
“We are asking all Queensland to continue to monitor the list of interstate exposure venues for 14 days after you arrive to ensure no new venues have been added,” a statement read.
“We are also asking all Queenslanders to reconsider travel to Victoria.”

New South Wales Health says authorities are continuing to closely monitor the situation in Victoria.
People arriving from the Greater Melbourne area from 6am on Wednesday must complete a declaration that confirms they have not attended a venue of concern.
Anyone who has attended any of the exposure venues at the times listed must contact New South Wales Health immediately on 1800 943 553.
“These declaration forms provide critical information to enable New South Wales Health to contact travellers if required and is for all travellers who intend to enter New South Wales by air, road and rail having been in Greater Melbourne in the previous 14 days,” a statement read.

Infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake told Sky News, northern hemisphere countries would be watching “with some amazement” how Australia responds to one or two COVID-19 cases appearing suddenly.

Mr Senanayake said despite the very low case load which continued to emerge in Australia, one or two COVID-19 cases could “turn into something a lot worse” particularly with new, more virulent variants.

“Perhaps something like we had in Melbourne in the middle of last year,” he said.

“Certainly our public health authorities throughout the states and territories have managed these outbreaks very well, but there is also luck involved.

“People in the northern hemisphere probably watch with some amazement how we respond to one or two cases suddenly appearing.”

The Victorian man who tested positive after completing hotel quarantine in South Australia has returned another positive test, but his three household contacts have not.

He underwent the mandatory 14-day quarantine period in South Australia after returning to Australia and arrived back in Victoria on May 4.

He began displaying COVID symptoms when he returned to his Wollert home on May 8 and got tested on May 10 before returning a positive result on Tuesday morning.

Victoria Health Minister Martin Foley outlined the tier-one sites the infected man visited. People who visited these sites must get tested and isolate for 14 days.

“Firstly, the Melbourne CBD, the Curry Vault Indian restaurant and bar at 18 to 20 Bank Place between 6:30pm and 9:30pm on Friday, 7 May," Mr Foley said,

“Secondly, in Epping, Indiagate Spices and Groceries at unit 14 C, 560 - 590 High St, Epping between 5pm and 6pm on Saturday eight May.”

The tier-two sites listed require people to return a negative COVID-19 test result.

“The first site is in Altona North. It is the TIC group, which is a warehouse, it is the rear warehouse section at 200 and 32 Blackshaw Road, all day on Thursday 6 May. 

“In Epping at 7-11, and that is the 7-11 at 705 High St, which is on the corner of Cowper Street between 6:30pm and 7pm on Thursday six May, and the Epping 7-11 again at the same site, 705 High St on the corner of Cowper Street between 11:10am and 11:40am on Saturday, 8 May.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia is “moving beyond emergency responses” to the pandemic and has begun the recovery phase.

The prime minister said the upcoming budget will show how the government was “protecting Australia” against the COVID-19 pandemic.

“How we create jobs, how we guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, whether it be in aged care or mental health, the National Disability Insurance Scheme,” Mr Morrison said.

“It's against that pandemic background that tonight's budget is framed. We will continue to take responsible action to save lives and to save livelihoods.

“While moving beyond emergency responses as we have been doing for these last 18 months, we move into the recovery phase and continue to provide the support that both Australians need, to protect their lives, and to protect their livelihoods.”

South Australia Chief Health Officer Professor Nicola Spurrier has confirmed the Victorian man who returned a positive COVID-19 test this morning tested negative on multiple occasions while undergoing hotel quarantine in Adelaide. 

She confirmed the state’s hotel quarantine program included testing patients on days one, five, nine and thirteen. 

The man – who recently returned from overseas – from discharged from the medihotel upon completing his mandatory 14-day quarantine period and returned immediately home to Victoria. 

“We usually decide that the infectious period is two days before somebody develops symptoms which would have been May 6 so if people in South Australia are thinking could this person possibly have been out and about here in South Australia it doesn’t look like that is the case,” Professor Spurrier told the media. 

She said state officials were engaged in an “interjurisdictional or bi-jurisdictional outbreak investigation” and were looking at several hypotheses as to how the man contracted the virus. 

One theory was he was potentially exposed to the virus before entering quarantine and had a very long incubation period. 
Another was a potential breach in the hotel quarantine system. 

“People are aware that this has happened in other hotels in other states so this is obviously right at the top of our mind in terms of seeing whether this could have happened here in South Australia,” Professor Spurrier warned.  

“I think people have really started to understand that this is a particularly nasty and sneaky virus which is very easily transmitted form one person to another.” 

The infected patient was staying in a room in the Playford medihotel adjacent to a positive patient before they were transferred.

Anthony Mundine says there are “evil plans” to reduce the global population, suggesting the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is “blatant genocide”.

Veteran broadcaster Ray Hadley has blasted Australian boxing great Anthony Mundine for calling the COVID-19 vaccine rollout “blatant genocide” and suggesting there are “evil plans” in place to enforce global depopulation — while offering no proof to back up his outrageous claims.
Mundine shared a bizarre post to his Facebook page on Monday afternoon, calling on his followers to “do your research” about the coronavirus.
The 45-year-old claimed, without any supporting evidence whatsoever, the vaccine paralyses the body’s immune system. In actuality, vaccines work by training the immune system to fight diseases.
“You take the shot then you will have serious health problems even death!” Mundine wrote.
“There (sic) evil plans are to depopulate the world to 1 billion people we are at 7/8 billion now … this is blatant genocide on the human race with a virus that has 99.7% recovery rate!
“I’ll let my immune system go to work cause if you take the shot your immune system becomes paralysed!
“DON'T TAKE IT! DO YOUR RESEARCH.”
Mundine’s plea to his social media followers goes against all recommended health advice, with medical professionals urging people to get vaccinated when they can.
Speaking on his 2GB radio show on Tuesday, Hadley laid into Mundine.
“In the past, I’ve ignored your rantings … because I think at the base of it you’re not a bad person. But this irresponsible stupidity that you’re now posting can cause great concern for people,” Hadley said.
“Anthony, I’ll take my medical advice from professors and doctors, not you.
“You read that somewhere on the internet, did you, Anthony? Or did someone read it to you?
“It’s just mind-boggling that a young man who’s reasonably intelligent, one would hope, could come out with such unadulterated bulls**t. Because that’s exactly what it is.”

The government’s handling of Australia’s vaccine rollout has come under fire for not matching the speed and efficiency of other vaccination efforts around the world.
Last month Prime Minister Scott Morrison scrapped plans to announce a new deadline to vaccinate all Australians by the end of the year against COVID-19 in an admission over the “uncertainties” surrounding the program.
Vaccination efforts have also been complicated by a small number of cases of people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine developing blood clots. Around four to six people out of every million suffered the rare illness after receiving the AstraZeneca shot.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) subsequently advised everyone under the age of 50 to receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca shot.
More than 200,000 Australians have participated in feeding back data on the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. Some 51.8 per cent of respondents reported some kind of adverse reaction, but only 1.2 per cent experienced reactions serious enough for them to seek medical attention.

Mundine retired from professional boxing following a first-round knockout defeat against Michael Zerafa in March.
The former rugby league star was an embarrassment in his final fight, failing to lay a glove on Zerafa and being knocked down twice in two minutes.
Mundine had won just one fight since 2014 and lost five of his final six bouts, taking his official record to 48-11.
The former world champion had “retired” several times before, most notably after his brutal loss to Jeff Horn three years ago.

In August an Aussie health company implemented a 70-hour, or nine-day fortnight without a pay cut. This is what it looks like in practice.
The Australian Tax Office has warned what they will be putting under scrutiny this year.

From working-from-home to pivoting strategy, although all businesses, companies and workplaces were affected by COVID-19, some were able to use the upheaval to change their company culture for the better.
For Melbourne health technology company ANDHealth, this meant implementing a company wide 70-hour (or nine-day fortnight) working scheme, something they did without a pay cut.
And despite many offices being given the all-clear to return, ANDHealth have continued their remote working arrangements with reduced hours.
Speaking to news.com.au, ANDHealth’s CEO and Managing Director Bronwyn Le Grice, said this transition came after she noticed the extra mental toll of working from home.
“I was becoming quite aware of Zoom fatigue,” she says. “I had one week where I had maybe 30 hours of Zoom meetings and by the end of that week I literally felt like I had to crawl under a rock.
“What we saw was that working from home offers immense flexibility but when you’re working from home you also work with greater intensity.”

Bronwyn Le Grice says the intensity of working-from-home during COVID made her realise that extra measures had to be taken to protect the work-life-balance of her employee. Picture: Supplied.Source:Supplied
The 70-hour fortnight became a way to help her employees balance their work and personal lives.
“It was an acknowledgment that if you want people to be on all the time, then make sure they have time to do other stuff, live their lives, and do the things that improve their own physical and mental wellbeing,” she says.
In practice, ANDHealth employees are able to choose when they want to work their fortnightly 70 hours. For some, this may mean seven-hour working days, while others may prefer a nine-day fortnight or lengthier days from Monday to Thursday with a weekly day off on Friday. The latter is how Ms Le Grice structures her office hours.
“I have long days from Monday to Thursday and have Fridays to do other things, which include hanging out with my kids who are four and 16 months,” she says.
“One of our staff uses that time to walk his son to school everyday, the other staff work nine-day fortnights or use the time to do things they want to for themselves whether that’s having dinner with their parents, hanging out with their friends or even going to the day spa. It doesn’t really matter.”
Speaking to news.com.au, SEEK’s resident psychologist Sabina Read says flexible working practices have become particularly important in a post-pandemic employment landscape.
“I’m a firm believer that flexible work practices are not just the domain of parents and that’s what it used to be. That trend has long left the station,” she says.
“We’ve all got different needs and it’s up to the employee to understand what their needs are and find ways to put them on the table and propose them in ways that will work for both them and the employer.”
Ms Read also says compulsory work-from-home arrangements during COVID-19 proved that employers were able to work independently, removing the trust barrier that might once have existed.

“A lot of organisations and employees used to talk about trust and the idea that if you’re not seen then people don’t trust you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing,” she says. “The dial has shifted.”
While most offices have now returned to blended working-from-home and in-office setups, ANDHealth will continue largely working from home, with the wider team convening on creative and collaborative sessions, strategy days and monthly team lunches. Although she describes this working style as a “very self-empowered approach,” Ms Le Grice admits this all hinges on the trust she has in her employees.
“Everyone is trusted to deliver their outcome and many people might work more than 35 hours a week but they have the flexibility and control to design their own work week from a time perspective,” she says.
“We’re a small business but I have a relationship with everyone in the team and I think if you trust your staff, it comes back to you in spades.”
For employees, ANDHealth and Ms Le Grice, their flexible 70-hour work week has been an undoubted success. She’s noticed her team’s output, engagement and productivity has increased and she’s also reduced the “administrative burden” that came from having to approve leave requests like doctor’s appointments, family commitments and life admin.
“You don’t pay people for their hours, you pay people for what they create and if they’re creating value then who cares?” she says.
“I’d prefer to have people take the time off and come back to work fully focused than have them try to work through a pressing personal challenge.
“We all have lives, we all have friends, parents, partners, children, pets and it is just completely not feasible to say that you need to work 8am to 6pm every day and everything you do in life has to happen around that.”

The Melbourne venues visited by a Victorian man who tested positive to COVID-19 have been revealed as authorities scramble to trace his close contacts.
Business Council Chief Executive Jennifer Westacott says the government needs to produce a “timetable” for the nation’s vaccine rollout in conjunction with relieving restrictions. “The first thing we’ve got to prioritise is keeping our domestic economy going,” she told Sky News. “We’ve said when vulnerable people are done in the vaccine – that’s 1b as the government calls it – there is no basis at that point to shut domestic borders and we should be lifting those public health orders. “Because 52 per cent of people are not travelling because they’re worried … about getting stuck. “We do need to set that timetable that as we vaccinate the population, as we lower the risk, that we do start targeting exposure to international borders.”

Hundreds of Victorians have been ordered to isolate after a man returned from hotel quarantine in Adelaide and tested positive for ­coronavirus.
Alerts were issued on ­Tuesday for exposure sites in Melbourne’s CBD, Epping and Altona North between ­Thursday and Saturday last week. Health investigators believe the man, aged in his 30s, was infected while in hotel ­quarantine at The Playford Hotel. A patient in an adjacent hotel room on May 4 tested positive to COVID-19 — the same day the man was released from his 14 days of isolation and flew to Melbourne.

hundreds of train passengers were on Tuesday night ordered into isolation, after the Department of Health revealed the infected man travelled on public transport.
Authorities were scrambling to determine whether commuters may have been exposed to the virus last week.
Anyone who caught the 5.28pm Craigieburn to Southern Cross service on Friday May 7, or the 10.20pm Flinders Street to Craigieburn service on the same night, must get tested and isolate immediately.
Both services have been deemed a Tier 2 exposure site by the Department of Health.
“If you were on this service – in any carriage, and alighting and departing at any station – follow the health advice,” a statement read.
“If you travelled around this time but are unsure about which service you caught, please get tested.”
Flinders Street station, Southern Cross station and Craigieburn station have all been deemed Tier 3 exposure sites, meaning anyone who was at any of these stations on May 7 must monitor for COVID symptoms.

The man, aged in his 30s, arrived in Victoria and returned to his home in Wollert, on Melbourne’s northern fringe, on May 4 before developing symptoms on May 8.
He got tested on Monday, May 10, and returned a positive result on Tuesday morning.
The man visited the Curry Vault Indian Restaurant and Bar 18-20 Bank Place in Melbourne CBD from 6.30pm and 9.30pm on Friday 7 May.
He also attended the India Gate Spices and Grocery 14c, 560-590 High St Epping between 5pm and 6pm Saturday, 8 May and Epping Woolworths between 5.40pm and 6.38pm on Saturday, 8 May.
The TIC Group front office at 232 Blackshaws Road, Altona North, from 12:01am - 11:59pm May 6 is also a Tier 1 exposure site.
People who were present at any Tier 1 exposure site during impacted times must get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days.
The TIC Group warehouse in Altona North is also a Tier 2 exposure site for all day on May 6.
Tier 2 sites also include the Epping 7/11, 705 High St, on May 6 from 6.30pm to 7.30pm and between 11.10am and 11.40am on Saturday, 8 May.
Anyone who has visited a Tier 2 location during these times must get a test and isolate until they receive a negative result.
It comes as the owner of an embattled Melbourne CBD restaraunt declared a Tier 1 coronavirus exposure site says he is “devastated” by the pandemic’s latest blow to his business.
Curry Vault Indian Restaurant and Bar owner Kailash Sharma said news a COVID-19-infected man visited the Bank Place site on May 7 means he must now close for at least 14 days.
“It’s very concerning, it’s such a terrible feeling when innocent people caught up in this,” Mr Sharma told the Herald Sun.
“We are closed for a deep clean until 10pm tonight and all affected staff members have self-isolated,” he said.
He said his business had lost more than $100,000 last year due to multiple lockdowns.
“I’m just so shocked this has all happened. We’ve been closed for almost a year and now this.
“I can’t reopen for at least two weeks as I have no staff, it’s just devastating.

People who were present at any Tier 1 exposure site during impacted times must get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days.
The TIC Group warehouse in Altona North is also a Tier 2 exposure site for all day on May 6.
Tier 2 sites also include the Epping 7/11, 705 High St, on May 6 from 6.30pm to 7.30pm and between 11.10am and 11.40am on Saturday, 8 May.
Anyone who has visited a Tier 2 location during these times must get a test and isolate until they receive a negative result.
Health Minister Martin Foley said the man’s three primary household primary contacts had returned a negative test result.
“Preparatory actions were well under way should any of them have tested positive,” he said.
“My understanding is the gentleman departed India via the Maldives via Singapore into Adelaide.”
The infected man is currently isolating at home, the Department revealed.

It’s not yet known if the positive man was an employee or close contact of someone linked to Citadel Health.
The Herald Sun revealed on Tuesday that employees at the Melbourne CBD health business were sent home on Tuesday morning “as a precaution” after a COVID scare in their offices at 459 Collins St.
Citadel Health staff were asked to leave to work from home, with a Citadel spokeswoman confirming that the company was liaising with the state Department of Health.
The nature of any exposure or risk is not yet known.

Citadel Health provides software support for the health sector including hospitals.
Comment was being sought from the health department.
A Department of Health spokeswoman told the Herald Sun the exact locations and details of where the Wollert man had visited since arriving back into Victoria were being worked through and further alerts would be issued in time.
The Herald Sun understands Health Minister Martin Foley and Chief Health Officer will hold a press conference about the new case at 3.15pm on Tuesday.

In South Australian quarantine, guests are tested on day 1, 5 and 13, but the state has also recently introduced a day nine test.
South Australia’s chief health officer, Professor Nicola Spurrier, said the infected patient tested negative on all tests in quarantine.
But he was quarantining in a room adjacent to a confirmed positive case, who was eventually transferred to another hotel.
Professor Spurrier confirmed authorities were scrambling to determine how the man got the virus.
“Of course there’s a number of potential hypothesis and we’re working through all of these,” she said.
Professor Spurrier said the man may have been exposed to the virus before entering quarantine.
She added it was also a possibility that he may have picked up the virus while in hotel quarantine.
“This is obviously right at the top of our mind, seeing where the risk happened in South Australia,” she said.
The man was discharged on Tuesday, May 4, and returned straight home to Victoria.
“We usually decide the infectious period is two days before someone develops symptoms, which would be 6 May,” she said.
State opposition spokesman David Davis said the state government needed to quickly “pounce” on the new case.
He said the new case was “concerning” and would put Victoria’s contact tracing teams to the ultimate test.
“There are a couple of key things here. The state needs to have the very best contact tracing system in the land and we don’t … We know we don’t, we know the problems are still there,” he said.
“We don’t think the state’s contact tracing is still up to scratch, we still don’t think it’s equivalent to New South Wales or elsewhere, and it should be.”
When asked if he was concerned about the prospect of another lockdown, Mr Davis said if the medical advice recommended a shutdown, it needed to be made publicly available.
“If it’s necessary, if they can’t quickly, with the contact tracing, get a grip on this (case), we can see the risk to the state,” he added.
Travellers arriving in NSW from Melbourne will need to complete a declaration form confirming they have not attended a public exposure site linked to the new COVID-19 case.
From 6am on Wednesday the forms will come into effect for anyone who has been in Melbourne for the previous 14 days.
“These declaration forms provide critical information to enable NSW Health to contact travellers if required and is for all travellers who intend to enter NSW by air, road and rail having been in Greater Melbourne in the previous 14 days,” NSW said in a statement.
“This form includes contact details and confirmation of whether people have been to any venues of concern. Declaration forms must be completed within the 24-hour period prior to entering NSW, or on entry to NSW.”
One new case was added to Victoria’s tally in hotel quarantine on Tuesday, a passenger who arrived into Australia from overseas.
That was separate to the Wollert case.
There were 8155 vaccine doses administered and 12,918 test results received in the past 24 hours.
It follows the announcement on Monday that Perth had been downgraded to a green zone under Victoria’s traffic light permit system after West Australia recorded another day of no community transmissions.

The changes were effective from 11.59pm Monday and included Perth’s metropolitan area and the Peel region.
Victoria’s Chief Health Officer said the decision was based on an assessment of public health risks.
People entering Victoria from a green zone will still require a permit to visit the state.
They can be obtained at service.vic.gov.au and take around 5 minutes to be approved.
Green-zone permit holders are free to enter Victoria with no restrictions.
Western Australia’s capital was upgraded to a red zone on April 17, after a man was infected with coronavirus in the state’s hotel quarantine program.
He spent time in Perth before flying back to Melbourne when he was released from hotel quarantine.
It was only after he landed that he was told by West Australian authorities that he was a close contact of a positive case.
He immediately quarantined at his home in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, before moving into hotel quarantine at his request and testing positive.
The outbreak triggered a snap three-day lockdown in Perth, while all Victorians who returned home from Western Australia were forced to quarantine for 14 days.
Non-Victorians who entered the state from WA were required to enter hotel quarantine until a return flight could be arranged.
There are 18 active cases of coronavirus across Western Australia.
The state eased COVID-19 restrictions last Friday after close contacts linked to a cluster in hotel quarantine returned negative.

Nationals Senator Matt Canavan has defended Prime Minister Scott Morrison against criticism over his lack of a timeline relating to the opening of Australia’s borders.

His comment comes as the Morrison government prepares to hand down a big-spending federal budget later today which is expected to put the Commonwealth in deficit for decades.

Mr Canavan told Sky News “we live in a time of great uncertainty … and the key thing for us is to just remain nimble enough to respond”.

“Scott Morrison can’t stop the coronavirus in Nepal, Pakistan, or Saudi Arabia”.

His words echo those of Treasurer Josh Frydenberg who spoke to the press in a prebudget speech this morning claiming only assumptions could be made around border opening dates.

“In tonight's budget, we make some assumptions around vaccine rollout and around border closures and around the containment measures that are put in place in respect to COVID-19,” he said. 

“But it's very hard to be precise in the middle of a pandemic. There's a lot of uncertainty, globally and domestically with respect to the virus.”

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 years old.
Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said in March that their two-dose vaccine regimen was shown to be safe and highly effective in a trial of 2,260 12 to 15 year olds.

A recent COVID-19 case in Sydney that has stumped NSW Health officials has prompted the state’s chief health officer to issue a stern warning.
NSW Health authorities have slammed media outlets for identifying the man at the centre of Sydney’s latest coronavirus outbreak. Asked about the identity of the so-called “BBQ man”, Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said she was “incredibly disappointed” to see him being named in the media. “That was not in accordance with the wishes of the gentleman,” she said. “He’s really gone above and beyond to help us and I think that it’s not a good outcome from public health. “We obviously take the approach that where we need to we will be very frank with any information but that was not necessary.” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard also weighed in on the matter, saying it was “absolutely appalling”. “No journalist should think that it’s ok to go naming a patient, somebody who’s working with Health, it’s the quickest way to destroy the confidence of all of us if we think that some journalist thinks that it’s ok to name a patient who is actually working with us to make sure the community stays safe. “It stinks actually.”

NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant has stressed the importance of using QR codes to check into businesses as COVID-19 contact tracers scramble to find the source of infection for a man from Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
A man aged in his 50s and his wife became the first locally-acquired cases of the virus in NSW in more than a month when they tested positive last week.
Although the man’s genetic sequencing is a perfect match for a returned traveller from the US in hotel quarantine, NSW Health is yet to trace the exact point of transmission.
Authorities continue to believe he caught the virus during brief contact with an infectious person who was likely running errands in the community.
“The team has been thinking of every which way this transmission could have occurred,” Dr Chant told 2GB on Tuesday.
“(So far it is a) case that’s popped up in the eastern suburbs without explanation.
“We’ve always got to keep an open mind that there could be another source.
“This always adds uncertainty but at the moment we don’t have any clear crossover point for this gentleman.”

NSW Health has listed nine venues as close contact, which requires people who visited during allocated times to self-isolate for 14 days regardless of their test result.
Dr Chant urged businesses and their customers to continue vigilantly signing in using the Service NSW app’s QR code.

“This is a wake up call … the QR codes, we really need those and people to be using them,” she said.
“I think people can get a bit complacent.
“We have asked people to make sure they are in prominent places (within stores).
“We want to make sure there's no other transmission occurring in the community that we are missing.
“(COVID-19) can be quite mild ... so people might be putting off getting a test. But we need everyone pulling together … and come forward for testing.”

The Motley Fool’s Scott Phillips says the government’s COVID-19 response was spectacularly good.

“You can argue about how it could have been better targeted, whether businesses should have to repay money – those are the fringe arguments,” Mr Phillips told Sky News.

“But the result is spectacular good. Better than the government expected, better than the RBA expected.

“The treasurer and the PM have done a spectacular job.”

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has addressed the media ahead of his 2021 Budget speech tonight – saying “Australia makes its own luck”. 

“We must secure Australia’s economic recovery, tonight’s budget will do exactly that,” he said. 

“Australia’s strong position today is not a result of luck; Australia makes its own luck and tonight’s budget will lay out the Morrison government’s economic plan to secure Australia’s recovery. 

“A lot of work has been put in by a lot of people but tonight’s budget is not about us, tonight’s budget is about the Australian people, about guaranteeing their essential services, about creating more jobs and keeping Australians safe from COVID-19.” 

Asked about the vaccine rollout and international border closures moving forward, the treasurer said there were “assumptions” in the budget around those issues and “the containment measures that are put in place”. 

“But it’s very hard to be precise in the middle of a pandemic. 

“The key point is we’ll always follow the medical advice and we’ll always do our best to keep Australians safe.”

The head of the International Olympic Committee has pushed back a visit to Tokyo as Japan struggles to contain COVID-19.
Tokyo's Olympic organisers held a test event for rhythmic gymnastics on Saturday as they confirm operation capabilities and COVID-19 countermeasures ahead of the Summer Games.

Fake cheers, empty seats and the sound of pounding feet: welcome to the COVID-era Tokyo Olympics, which Japan seems determined to hold at all costs.
An athletics test event brought home the reality of hosting an Olympics during the pandemic, with athletes competing in a muted atmosphere and excitement hard to muster.
Foot-strikes echoed around Tokyo’s 68,000-capacity Olympic Stadium during track events, with recorded crowd noises reaching a crescendo as the runners approached the finish.
A fanfare of music greeted the end of the race, before the runners quickly departed down the tunnel, leaving a smattering of media and officials in the otherwise empty stadium.
“It’s weird running in a stadium with no fans,” US sprinter Justin Gatlin said after winning the men’s 100m.
“It feels almost like a time trial or kind of like an intra-squad meet.”

The athletics meet, one of a series of test events taking place in Tokyo, involved more than 400 competitors, only nine of them from overseas.
The atmosphere could be similar at this year’s coronavirus-delayed Games, with overseas fans already barred and organisers set to decide in June how many domestic spectators can attend, if any at all.
Although the test events are unusual, they lend weight to the argument that the Olympics can be held despite the pandemic, which has left Tokyo and other areas under a state of emergency.

There was more noise outside the stadium, with around 100 people protesting against an Olympics that polls show a majority of Japanese oppose.
“COVID-19 infection numbers are high in Tokyo and Osaka, with many severe cases,” said protester Takashi Sakamoto.
“I would like the money (for the Games) to be used in hospitals instead,” he told AFP.
Protesters Sunday said “no” to Tokyo Olympics with virus surging in Japan and less than 2% vaccinated. This is NOT a typo. 2%. Hospitals jammed and Olympics will divert 10,000 health-care workers.

On Monday, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach was forced to postpone a trip to Japan over the state of emergency.
And a poll by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily found 59 per cent of respondents want to cancel the postponed 2020 Games, which will open on July 23. The poll did not offer the option of a further postponement.
A separate survey by the TBS television channel found 37 per cent back cancellation, while 28 per cent want the Games delayed again.

‘Beyond safe’
Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was forced on the defensive on Monday, insisting in parliament he has “never put the Olympics first” and his priority remains “the lives and health of the Japanese people.”
An online petition urging the Games be cancelled has gathered more than 315,000 signatures since last Wednesday, but Games organisers insist the mega-event can be held safely with strict virus rules.
“I felt beyond safe,” said Gatlin.
“I’ve been tested every day, either saliva or nasal swab every morning.
“The bubble has been very successful. The only time I’ve seen the outside is when we get on the bus to go to the track.”

The rules were similarly strict at the Diving World Cup the previous weekend, which featured more than 200 divers from almost 50 countries somersaulting in silence with no fans present.
“We’ve been spitting in tubes a lot,” said British diver Tom Daley.
There were some frustrations, with Germany’s sport director Lutz Buschkow describing the restrictions as slightly claustrophobic.
“The most disappointing thing is that we can’t breathe any fresh air. That’s a really big burden for the athletes and trainers,” he told reporters.
“It would at least be nice if we got a chance to walk in the hotel garden or car park … it would be good if there was a way to fix these things.”

Gatlin said he hoped organisers might be “just a little more lenient” come the Games, but that is unlikely.
In an indication of the risks, organisers reported two coronavirus cases during the events: a diving coach who tested positive on arrival in Japan and was quarantined, and a support member of a rowing team who tested positive during the competition.
But neither case forced a halt to events, and there were no immediate reports of additional cases being detected.

The top US infectious diseases expert has called on India to take drastic action to protect its citizens and the world as the crisis spreads.

Scientists have lashed the Indian government for “squandering” its early successes in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, in a blistering editorial in a top medical journal.
The article in The Lancet said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempt “to stifle criticism” as the crisis escalates was “inexcusable”.
It came as the top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci said that India has “got to shut down” to take control of the devastating outbreak.
“You’ve got to shut down. I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission, and one of the ways to do that is to shut down,” the White House coronavirus adviser told the US ABC’s This Week on Sunday.

The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease told CNN News18 on Friday that a lockdown of just weeks would help “break the chain of transmission” and bring down the number of cases so the nation can vaccinate more people and “get ahead of the trajectory of the outbreak.”
India has now reported 22.66 million cases and 246,116 deaths with hospitals overwhelmed, severe oxygen shortages and trees felled in public parks to cope with an unprecedented surge in dead bodies and cremations. Hundreds of thousands of cases continue to be reported each day, and many believe the true numbers are much higher.

“The scenes of suffering in India are hard to comprehend,” reads the The Lancet article published on Saturday, which noted that health workers were exhausted and falling sick while social media is full of desperate doctors and relatives seeking life-saving supplies.
“Yet before the second wave of cases of COVID-19 began to mount in early March, Indian Minister of Health Harsh Vardhan declared that India was in the ‘endgame’ of the epidemic,” the article reads.

The government’s COVID taskforce had not met in months before April and India’s leaders gave the impression “that India had beaten COVID-19 after several months of low case counts, despite repeated warnings of the dangers of a second wave and the emergence of new strains.”
The article said that modelling had falsely suggested India had reached herd immunity “encouraging complacency and insufficient preparation” while data suggested that only 21 per cent of the population had antibodies in January.
“At times, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government has seemed more intent on removing criticism on Twitter than trying to control the pandemic,” the editorial reads.

“Despite warnings about the risks of superspreader events, the government allowed religious festivals to go ahead, drawing millions of people from around the country, along with huge political rallies — conspicuous for their lack of COVID-19 mitigation measures.”
It said this message that COVID “was essentially over” also slowed the vaccination rollout, with less than 2 per cent of the population currently vaccinated.
The article claimed that a lack of communication with state governments had led to “mass confusion” with states such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra much worse hit than others.
It said India now urgently needed to fix its “botched vaccination campaign”, reduce transmission as much as possible while the vaccine is rolled out and own up to its mistakes.
The Lancet article warned that the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation had predicted a “staggering” million deaths by August 1, and that if this were to happen, the Modi administration would be responsible for a “a self-inflicted national catastrophe”.

The disaster in India, one of the world’s largest vaccine-manufacturing nations, has also put Africa’s recovery in jeopardy.
“The vaccines situation is extremely complex now because of the situation in India,” said Cameroonian virologist John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the African Union’s health watchdog.
“We are hoping that there will be a continuous supply of vaccines through Covax from India, but we are watching in total horror and disbelief what is going on in India and we don’t expect that vaccines will be shipped out of India anytime soon.”
Africa has been spared the worst of the pandemic so far with just over 124,000 deaths officially recorded and 4.6 million cases, but its overcrowded cities, slums and fragile health system mean it faces many of the same challenges that caused India’s destructive wave.

Athletes ran to an eerily empty stadium at a test event in Tokyo ahead of the Summer Olympics
Spain has lifted a coronavirus state of emergency, allowing people to travel between regionsSource:AFP
Schools and stores reopened in several parts of Europe on Monday as the continent eased out of months of Covid-19 lockdowns, but India remained in the grip of a devastating outbreak.
Rapid vaccination programmes have allowed a number of wealthy nations to start taking steps towards normality, but the virus is still surging in many countries and concerns are growing about global vaccine inequality.
Ireland on Monday lifted domestic travel restrictions and began a phased reopening of non-essential retailers, while Greece opened nursery, elementary and middle schools.
Cinemas are also expected to reopen, as well as some large indoor venues after the government held several pilot events -- including a rock concert -- to test safety measures.
- Act 'responsibly' -
"The end of the state of emergency does not mean the end of restrictions. Far from it. The virus threat still exists," Justice Minister Juan Carlos Campo wrote in an opinion piece in El Pais, urging Spaniards to behave "responsibly."
And in Germany, people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 were exempt from many restrictions from Sunday after the government passed new legislation.
But in Norway, an expert government committee recommended that the country drop the Johnson & Johnson and the AstraZeneca jabs over the risks of rare but serious side effects.
- India variant worries -
The devastating wave has overwhelmed India's healthcare system, and experts have said official figures for cases and fatalities are much lower than the actual numbers.
The situation in India has been worsened by a new more contagious variant and there are fears it could potentially dodge some vaccine protections, World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told AFP on Saturday.
Underscoring the gravity of the Indian outbreak, an Australian court on Monday kept in place a contentious ban on citizens returning home from the country.
And China plans to set up a "separation line" on the summit of Mount Everest -- which straddles the China-Nepal border -- to avoid possible infections by climbers from Nepal, where dozens have been taken ill at base camp, state media reported.
The world got a glimpse of post-pandemic life as Tokyo hosted a test event ahead of the Summer Olympic Games.
"It's weird running in a stadium with no fans," US sprinter Justin Gatlin said after winning the men's 100m.
The United States remains the worst-hit nation in the world, with the highest number of known fatalities and infections.
The United States was battered by the pandemic, but since January new infections have come down as more than 114 million people have been fully vaccinated.

A swimming star is the first Olympian to receive one of her two COVID-19 injections as the AOC rejects claims athletes pushed in the line.
We put Australia's Olympians to the test to find out what they know about Japan - some might need to do their homework ahead of Tokyo 2021.

A relieved Cate Campbell can finally focus on winning an Olympic Games gold medal in Tokyo after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination in Brisbane on Monday.
Australia’s freestyle sprint queen admitted she panicked last week when she realised time was running out to get the first of two Pfizer vaccine jabs.
“When I saw the announcement came out, I was like `I need to get the vaccine in about a week’ and it was almost a week to the day since I had that thought and here I am (after) my first vaccination,” she said.
“I’m really glad that we can get it far enough away from the Olympics so that if there are any adverse side effects, we’ll be well and truly over them by the time it comes around to Olympic trials (next month).
“We are going into a pretty unknown situation over in Tokyo, so to have this little Band-Aid is a huge weight off everyone’s shoulders.”
While the vaccine isn’t compulsory for Australia’s Olympic and Paralympic contingent – set to total more than 2000 including officials — AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said it “provides comfort” for Olympians given the COVID concerns in Japan and rejected claims athletes have pushed in front of the queue.
“We’re not queue jumping,” he said.
“No one (in the public) is missing out, we’re running the vaccination process and we’re not putting the load on the public system whatsoever.”

Campbell was confident most, if not all, Olympians, would have the jabs.
“As far as I know everyone is putting up their had and saying ‘yes please and thank you’,” she said.
“The majority of competitors from first world countries will have had the vaccine as well, so we definitely want to even the playing fields as much we can with Brits and the Americans.
“No-one can guarantee anything. We’ve learnt that so much in the past year and a half, that this virus can change and mutate, and it’s up to us to play catch-up, by getting the vaccine, we’re getting on the front foot, which is really great.”
Campbell – who returned to Queensland in December with coach Simon Cusack after two years in NSW – said Australian athletes were fortunate to be able to prepare normally for the Olympics.
“The pandemic has impacted everyone, let’s not understate that but we are incredibly privileged in Australia to exist in a society where COVID doesn’t impact us on a daily basis,” she said.
“We still have access to all our training facilities, and everyone who we need to see. That’s been really helpful in preparing for these games.
“The rest of the world, the COVID situation that they’re dealing with, is much more dire than what we’re facing in Australia.”
As she prepares for her fourth Olympics, 28-year Campbell said she was better prepared than she was for the 2016 Rio Games.
“I have changed some mindsets going in, I’ve shaken up my training program, I’ve tried to keep a more balanced lifestyle, and I’m really looking forward to going in,” said Campbell, whose two Olympic gold medals have come in 4x100m freestyle relay events in Rio and nine years ago in London.
The Tokyo Olympic Games Opening ceremony will be held on July 23rd, 2021.

While no firm conclusion about the theories surrounding COVID-19 can be arrived at, available data is “fairly firmly in favour” of the virus coming from the lab at Wuhan, according to science writer and editor Nicholas Wade.

“In the Wuhan lab they were taking bat coronaviruses – that’s the same kind as the SARS-CoV-2 virus – and they were swapping in and out the spike protein from related coronaviruses,” he told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.

“They were trying to get a virus that was most infective for humans.”

Sky News host Sharri Markson says there is a “great deal of evidence” Chinese military scientists were undertaking research about bio-weaponising SARS coronaviruses.

A document produced by the Chinese military discussed the weaponisation of SARS coronaviruses five years before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

“It’s clear they had a highly developed bio-weapons program that had been operational for many, many years,” Ms Markson told Sky News host Rita Panahi.

“It’s very obvious that this was going on and that it involved coronaviruses as well as other pathogens and other viruses.”

The world is now “better prepared” to hear what research on COVID-19 early in the pandemic “clearly showed,” according to Flinders University Professor Nikolai Petrovsky.

His comments come following the revelations from a document produced by Chinese military scientists – in which they discuss weaponizing SARS coronaviruses.

Discussing the revelations with Sky News host Chris Kenny, Professor Petrovsky said the “pendulum has really swung back the other way”.

“Early on in this pandemic our research clearly showed there were a lot of unusual features about this virus,” he said.

“It was exquisitely human adapted from day one – that puzzled us enormously and raised questions how this virus came about.”

The leader of a nation of 30m people could be toppled as cases rise 1200 per cent and both beds and oxygen run out in a “devastating” unfolding crisis.
Nepal is facing a major Covid crisis with hospitals running out of oxygen and beds in scenes similar to India.

The COVID-19 crisis engulfing the mountainous nation of Nepal probably started somewhere like the border town of Birgunj.
Known as the “Gateway to Nepal”, bustling Birgunj is a main link between the capital Kathmandu and Kolkata, India’s third largest city with 14 million residents.
The two countries share an open border; no passports are needed and citizens of each country walk or drive freely across the frontier every day.
It’s likely that a few weeks ago, the new and more contagious Indian variant of COVID-19 hitched a ride over the border and sunk its spike proteins into the nation of 30 million.
“One of my best friends has COVID; my relatives in Kathmandu have COVID; almost every household has one or two people with COVID,” Sydneysider Shamim Anwar, whose parents live in Birgunj, told news.com.au.
His mum and dad have so far not tested positive, but Mr Anwar fears it’s only a matter of time.
“By population, the situation is worse than India. Most people I know in Nepal have COVID. It’s devastating”.

Nepal ‘staring into the abyss’
On Sunday, Nepal recorded 8777 new cases of coronavirus. That might not seem much when compared to India’s 400,000 daily infections, but India’s 1.3 billion inhabitants is far more than its Himalayan neighbour’s 29 million.
ICU beds have run out, oxygen is running out and the Prime Minister’s time may soon be up too, with leader KP Sharma Oli facing a no-confidence motion in the country’s parliament today.
He has been compared to Emperor Nero, of “fiddling when Rome burned”.
Earlier in the crisis he recommended the Nepalese gargle with guava leaves to ward off infection. It didn’t work.
In March, fewer than 100 people a day were being diagnosed in Nepal. In late April, daily cases broke the 1000 mark. The current seven day rolling average is 8100. Bodies are being cremated en masse.
“Nepal is staring into the COVID abyss with cases skyrocketing by 1200 per cent in weeks,” thundered the Indian Express newspaper.
“Experts believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg as the high positivity rate shows that Nepal isn’t detecting nearly enough cases,” the paper reported.
Around 500 kilometres to the west of Birgunj is Nepalgunj. Another border town, it’s now the country’s second COVID-19 epicentre outside Kathmandu.
“The hospital is overloaded, we are treating patients at each and every corner of the building,” said Badri Chapagain, a doctor at the hospital.

‘Cases were hidden’
India’s recent state elections saw massive rallies, thronging with people. A large religious festival also took place, which many Nepalese people attended. Both are thought to have been the ideal conditions to spread the virus.
Nepal took steps to limit border crossing, but as it did so, tens of thousands of Nepalis working in India rushed home, likely bringing COVID-19 with them.
“When it came to Nepal, they couldn’t control it,” said Mr Anwar.
“At first the cases in Nepal were all hidden, the main media didn’t cover it. But when people were dying everyday people began posting about it on social media.”
The crisis has been exacerbated due to several factors.
Nepal’s healthcare system is weak with 1595 intensive car beds and 480 ventilators. According to World Bank data, it has just 0.7 physicians per 100,000 people. That’s fewer than India’s 0.9 per cent.
On May 8, 22 of the country’s health districts had bed shortages, according to Nepal’s Health Emergency Operation Centre.

Red tape not helping already stretched health system
To critics, the government in Kathmandu has seemed to hinder more than help.
They point to a diktat from the health ministry which ordered hospitals to ask for official permission before they could refill their already small number of oxygen tanks, creating more red tape in the midst of a crisis.
Local media have reported that several hospitals have now called patients’ families asking them to take them home as they cannot supply them with oxygen. Four major hospitals have told the Government they will be unable to admit patients if the supply of oxygen is interrupted.
“The government hospitals are without beds. The private hospitals, where beds are available, have not been able to provide services due to the lack of oxygen due to the government’s decision,” the Association of Private Health Institution of Nepal told the Kathmandu Post.
A lockdown is now in place in the capital.
Mr Anwar is doing what he can, from Sydney, to help Nepal. Through Himani Kosh, the Australian arm of the Himani Trust, a charity set up by a former Nepali princess, he has started a GoFundMe page. He is hoping to raise $50,000 to pay for food, medicine, equipment and oxygen.

A lack of vaccinations has also hit Nepal hard. Just 7.2 per cent of the population have had a jab, mostly AstraZeneca vials produced in India. But that country’s COVID crisis has led it to stop exporting the shots so it can ramp up its own vaccination drive.
The situation in Nepal is in stark contrast to nearby Bhutan which also neighbours India. The nation of 800,000 vaccinated 93 per cent of its citizens in a little over two weeks in April. By the time India stopped shipping vaccines, Bhutan was done.
Yesterday, it reported just 15 cases of COVID-19; it has seen one single death throughout the entire pandemic.
“Bhutan has been well managed but you look at Nepal and it’s having issues getting the vaccine from India,” said Mr Anwar.

PM is ‘Nero fiddling while Rome burns’
Ahead of Monday’s no confidence vote in the Kathmandu parliament, PM Oli is getting a drubbing.
An opinion piece in The Kathmandu Post mocked his schedule.
“He is a busy man. He starts his day as early as eight or nine at times.
“(But) he is too busy to pay attention to the raging coronavirus pandemic that on Thursday claimed 54 lives.”
Some local analysts have said a feud between factions in the ruling coalition has taken his mind off the emergency.
“This could lead to further escalation of the political crisis, thereby putting the pandemic crisis out of focus,” stated the editorial.
Others were more caustic.
“Prime Minister Oli can be compared with Nero, the fifth Roman emperor who earned notoriety for fiddling when Rome burned … for his indifference towards people’s plight,” said Rajendra Maharjan, a political commentator.
“He is not a bit worried even though people are dying for a lack of beds and oxygen.”
Nepalis desperately need a government focused on the virus that is gripping the nation, not infighting.
For Mr Anwar, he just wants to help his parents, and others, from contracting COVID-19 in a country not equipped to deal with their health needs should they fall ill.
“It’s really painful knowing my friends and family have got or are getting COVID.
“It’s emotionally and psychologically painful and stressful right now. I just try to help them with whatever means I can.”

Sky News host Chris Kenny says his “main reason” for opposing the India travel ban is because it is a “fundamental breach” of a citizen’s rights - after it was announced on Monday the Federal Court rejected a bid to overturn the ban. 

Mr Kenny’s comments come after the Morrison government implemented a ban on all Australians returning from India until May 15 – threatening heavy fines and jail time for those able to breach the ban.

The ban was implemented amid continual COVID-19 concerns. 

“Banning citizens, telling them they can't come home, threatening to prosecute them if they do, from any country, let alone singling out just one country, is an extreme action,” Mr Kenny said. 

“Because a basic right of a citizen is to be able to return to their own country”. 

“I, for one, don't want to see such a ban imposed ever again”. 

Mr Kenny spoke to constitutional lawyer, Professor George Williams, about the issue.

Most Australians who get critically ill with COVID-19 have lingering health issues, early results from a study shows, although the seriousness varies.
Doctors are warning that patients who have survived COVID-19 may be left with longer-term health problems.

About two in three Australians have ongoing health issues after being critically ill with COVID-19, early results from a study shows.
The COVID Recovery Study has been tracking about 200 patients across 30 different hospitals in Australia about the lingering impacts of getting the coronavirus, six to 12 months after they were infected and admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Monash University Professor Carol Hodgson told the ABC that early results showed about 30 per cent of people were “alive and disability free” six months after contracting the virus.
The other 70 per cent of patients mostly experienced mild symptoms including shortness of breath and weakness, with a small number having a persistent cough, headache, or loss of taste and smell.
Those who were the most sick were the most likely to have continuing health issues.
Burnet Institute principal research fellow Joseph Doyle said COVID-19 was “far more serious” than influenza, in both the initial infection and the potential longer-term impacts.
“[COVID-19] clearly has a much higher chance of killing you when you get it than the flu does, and a much higher chance of getting you into hospital and intensive care,” he told the ABC.
However, not everyone will experience ongoing issues, especially if they have only had a mild cases, and most people do recover fully.

RELATED: Extra reason for Aussies to get jab
Dr Doyle said that because COVID-19 was mainly a lung infection, there was a risk of lung damage leading to a lack of exercise capacity and fitness that could take weeks or months to recover.
He said there were “some very specific symptoms”, including weakness and tiredness, which lingered following COVID in some patients.
Other patients whose immune systems become overactive can get blood clots, or have heart attacks and strokes, which also have their own long-term consequences.
“COVID doesn’t just affect the lungs and make you sick like some other viruses do,” Dr Doyle said.
Being hospitalised, especially if you spend a lot of time in Intensive Care, can also cause issues regardless of what condition you have.
About half of the critically ill patients in the Australia study needed to be put on ventilators while in Intensive Care and these were usually in hospital for about four weeks.
“Four weeks [total] in hospital, that does result in significant ICU-acquired weaknesses,” Prof Hodgson said.
She said this was caused by a “cytokine storm”, in which cells release cytokine, a protein that causes inflammation and a breakdown of muscle protein.
“We know that this [muscle breakdown] can be quite prolonged and can last up to five years in other types of critically ill patients.”
She said the symptoms reported in the Australian study were more likely to be physical than psychological, but the scientists were “seeing an increased number of patients who test positive to being at risk of post-traumatic stress”.
Vaccinations are the best protection against such long-term effects of COVID, she said.
Editor’s note: The original version of this story incorrectly stated that 70 per cent of ALL COVID patients still suffered lingering symptoms. It is only 70 per cent of those who were critically ill with the virus.

Australians who are vaccinated against COVID-19 could see some crucial benefits in terms of travel, the health minister says.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

Vaccinated Australians could receive easier passage to and from the country in a plan aimed at incentivising immunisation, the health minister says.
A record 402,000 COVID-19 vaccines were administered across the nation last week, as the government faced pressure to reveal when the international border closure will end.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the prospect of reopening should compel Australians to get immunised, but warned the border would open incrementally over time.
“It should certainly be an incentive to get vaccination,” he told reporters on Monday.
“What we are also looking at with regards to the opening of borders is that progressive capacity, based on medical advice for those that have been vaccinated to have easier passage out and easier passage in,” he said.
In April, Mr Hunt said even a 100 per cent vaccination rate was “no guarantee” of the border reopening.
“(It) is based on a series of factors … If the whole country were vaccinated, you couldn’t just open the borders,” he said.
Vaccines were highly effective at reducing serious symptoms caused by COVID-19, Mr Hunt said, but key to the reopening decision would be their effectiveness at stopping transmission of the virus.

Mr Hunt also confirmed the government would respond “in full” to the Royal Commission into Aged Care, which delivered 148 recommendations in a final report in March.
The health minister would not “pre-empt” the announcement, but said it would prove to be a “line in the sand” for the sector.
“It will be a record investment in aged care and will also be a record response to any royal commission in Australian history,” he said.
“Not only is it about investment, but it is about the deep and profound respect for older Australians.
“If we can produce not only the support but also respect and care and dignity, then I think we will have achieved something.”
The government in 2019 received a damning interim report from the Royal Commission titled ‘Neglect’, outlining the “cruel and harmful” system awaiting Australians in their old age.
When the final report was handed down, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government’s response would be detailed in the budget.
But Labor leader Anthony Albanese on Monday accused the Coalition of “sitting around” in the interim, saying it “waits around until there’s a crisis” before responding.
“This government has sat on eight years of neglect,” Mr Albanese said.
“This government also cut funding for aged care, directly by Scott Morrison, and hasn’t put that money back in spite of the interim report of the Royal Commission. So this is a real test.”

After the reopening of the travel bubble between New Zealand and NSW, an infectious diseases expert says more bubbles will be open in months.
After 395 days, international travel between New Zealand and Australia has opened, in which travellers were warmly greeted at Wellington airport.

An infectious diseases expert says more travel bubbles will be opening between Australia and other countries within the next few months.
Speaking to Channel 9’s Today Show, Professor Robert Booy at the University of Sydney said despite the federal government pointing to a 2022 reopening, he believes more corridors will open this year.

The comments come as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australian borders will be reopened in 2022 under a “cautious approach”, but there’s a huge wildcard driving uncertainty about when and how quickly that will happen.
“We have New Zealand, we’ll have many more,” he explained.
“Pacific Islands – we’ll have more places, perhaps in Asia as they totally clamp down and have high vaccination rates as well.
“We’ll get to a point where this virus is more like a cold – that too will help us open up.”
According to Tuesday’s budget preview, the Morrison Government has conceded the big question around the reopening of the border remains the threat that people who are vaccinated may still be able to catch and spread COVID, even if the vaccine means it will no longer kill them.

Booster shots may also be required to improve the immunity of travellers who go to regions with new variants that are immune to the first generation vaccines.
It’s that uncertainty that’s driving delays and caution over the reopening of Australia’s international borders that will likely be delivered in a staggered changes that test the impact of each small step to return to normal.
With the trans-Tasman travel bubble up and running, where we could be allowed to travel to next has been hot on the agenda.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously mentioned places like Singapore and Japan and South Korea, but despite the corridor across the ditch – no further locations have moved forward on.

Liberal Senator James Paterson has revealed he holds concerns about China’s lack of transparency amid revelations researchers discussed the use of biological weapons five years before COVID-19 struck.

Mr Paterson – who chairs the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security - said he was “concerned” that Chinese military researchers had discussed biological warfare in the document.

“What this paper shows is it is of a great deal of interest to the highest levels of the People’s Liberation Army,” he said.

“What we would ask of them, as we’d ask of any government in the world, is to be transparent and open about that.”

Mr Paterson said as China was a signatory to major international agreements banning the research of biological weapons, he was concerned whether the interest in the paper had “gone further”.

“China like many other countries has entered into obligations not to conduct research of this nature for all these reasons outlined in your introduction,” he said.

“They are highly dangerous weapons that could do massive harm to our societies and no one wants to see them released.

“The interest they have is noteworthy and what we’d be concerned about is whether that interest has gone any further.”

His comment came after Sky News host Sharri Markson revealed in The Australian newspaper that a document produced by Chinese military scientists discussed the weaponisation of SARS coronaviruses five years before the pandemic hit.

The sentiments shared by Mr Paterson were echoed by his British counterpart Tom Tugendhat who chairs the United Kingdom’s Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

Mr Tugendhat said the decision by China’s top military scientists to engage in discussions about biological weapons was in itself a concerning development.

“This is not a fringe scientist talking about it in a sort of conspiracy way,” he said.

“This is a mainstream scientist who’s got the ear of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party who is talking about some of the most dangerous weapons the world has ever known.

“It is concerning that this is a major Chinese scientific institution talking about such weapons.”

Both men raised concerns with how transparent China had been in dealing with the World Health Organisation investigation into COVID-19.

Mr Paterson went so far as to describe China’s actions as being “obstructive”.

“The obstruction of the World Health Organisation’s investigation into the origins of COVID-19 does raise real concerns about that failure to be transparent,” he said.

“When the World Health Organisation team got to China they found themselves obstructed every step of way in terms of access to data, access to personnel and access to key sites.

“If they were not willing to be transparent with that process, I fear they will not be willing to be transparent with any process.”

Musician Amy Shark has scolded the Queensland Premier on social media, accusing Annastacia Palaszczuk of deserting the music industry, which was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Sunshine State Labor leader tweeted a celebratory photograph from Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night after the Queensland Reds won the Super Rugby grand final.
“Queensland are the comeback kings,” Ms Palaszczuk’s caption read, accompanying a photo of her giving an enthusiastic thumbs up alongside the state’s Sport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe.
I wish you’d support the music industry like this @AnnastaciaMP we need help x https://t.co/XINspL5tCv
Amy Shark, the ARIA-winning popular indie singer from the Gold Coast, led a chorus of backlash online fuming at the premier’s celebration of the rugby match’s crowd size given the industry’s struggles to perform to capacity audiences.
“I wish you’d support the music industry like this, Annastacia Palaszczuk,” the musician said in a retweet of the premier’s post.
“We need help.”

Others joined in, demanding music venues be given the opportunity to increase event attendance numbers.
“It’s insulting seeing the number of people allowed to cram into sports stadiums while we are left with half capacities and no wriggle room,” another user tweeted.
Concert venues, theatres and auditoriums are restricted from hosting capacity crowds due to a Queensland Health COVID-19 directive.

Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says there is an “assumption” in tomorrow’s budget international borders will be open to immigration next year but it does not necessarily appear to be backed by the prime minister. 

“It’s a Treasury department projection not backed in it seems necessarily by Scott Morrison,” he told Sky News. 

“Australia is getting what it’s used to, a tough on borders election which is where my concern comes that we could be locked off from the rest of the world for the next four years.” 

Mr Clennell pointed to the success of the COVID-19 vaccine as a ultimate decider on borders moving forward. 

“What’s been said to me is if it stops you getting the virus, if that’s proven then our international borders will be open earlier. If it just stops people getting as sick maybe not everyone the government will be more reluctant to move quickly on it.”

Health Minister Greg Hunt says unless Australia cuts itself completely from the rest of the world there is no guarantee there will never be another COVID-19 case. 

Providing a coronavirus update today, Mr Hunt said there had been a total 81 days this year where zero community transmission had been recorded but warned cases would pop up “from time to time”. 

“Unless we completely wall ourselves off from the world with nobody coming in, nobody going out, no trade going out, no trade coming in, then nobody, nobody can guarantee that there will be zero cases.

“When there have been cases we know how to deal with it, incredibly strong responses. 

“We’re very confident in every state and territory’s testing and tracing programs.” 

He also confirmed as of today 2.663 million vaccine doses had been distributed across the country.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has unveiled his big-spending budget, proclaiming that the Australian economy is “roaring back to life”.

The Treasurer has marvelled at Australia’s resilience while handing down the budget, declaring it outperformed almost every other nation recovering from the debilitating COVID-19 pandemic.
Josh Frydenberg delivered his third federal budget on Tuesday, saying Australia was well on the road to recovery.
“In the face of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the Australian spirit has shone through,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“Australia’s economic engine is roaring back to life.
“We are better placed than nearly any other country to meet the economic challenges that
lie ahead.
“Team Australia at its best.”
Josh Frydenberg says Australia has responded strongly to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Philip GostelowSource:Supplied
Despite the significant and unavoidable cost of responding to the COVID-19 recession, Mr Frydenberg said the government’s plan to protect Australians from the virus and create more jobs was working.
He said half a million jobs had been created since the October budget, and business conditions had reached record highs.
Net debt will hit $617.5bn or 30 per cent of gross domestic product this year, and peak at $980.6bn or 41 per cent of GDP in June 2025.
But Mr Frydenberg said Australia’s debt level was low by international standards.
“As a share of the economy, net debt is around half of that in the UK and US and
less than a third of that in Japan,” he said.
The Treasurer acknowledged the pandemic was far from over, as 800,000 new cases a day were being recorded across the world.
Mr Frydenberg said the global economic environment remained uncertain, adding that parts of Europe had fallen back into recession.
He said it was “remarkable” that after Treasury feared unemployment could reach 15 per cent and the economy contract by more than 20 per cent, the jobless rate was now 5.6 per cent.
“Australia’s fate could have been so much worse,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“The United Kingdom, France and Italy all contracted by more than 8 per cent, Japan and
Canada by around 5 per cent. Australia, just 2.5 per cent.”

The Morrison government’s plan to secure Australia’s economic recovery in this federal budget involves extending several initiatives that it believes have worked.
This includes a whopping $15bn infrastructure outlay, as well as incentives for tradies to buy new utes.
The government has also sought to ease barriers for first home buyers and tax cuts will be extended for low-income and middle-income earners.
In response to the damning aged care royal commission, the government will invest $17.7bn in aged care reforms, including funding another 80,000 new home care packages.
Working families looking to take on more days will also benefit from increased childcare subsidies for two or more children in care.
Mr Frydenberg said Australia’s manufacturing sector would be a key driver of future jobs and higher wages.
The push to lower the unemployment rate to below 5 per cent is a key factor in the government’s plan to pay for the incentives through tax receipts and lower welfare bills.
He also hit back at the opposition, which has repeatedly accused the government of making policy announcements on the run, saying the government had delivered on its promises.
“We promised more jobs and we delivered,” he said.
“Australia is coming back.”

A small private hospital in India’s most populous state has been charged under the National Security Act for raising the alarm about oxygen shortages.

The move marks the latest action taken by authorities in the state to clamp down on what they call 'black marketing' and 'spreading rumours' as the nation recorded over 400,000 new cases in the last 24 hours.

The federal government has done all the “heavy lifting” in providing funding for infrastructure in areas suffering amid the COVID-19 pandemic – particularly in Queensland – according to Liberal MP Julian Simmonds. 

“We have a lot of projects that have been over a number of budget cycles that are pouring money into Queensland to get us the infrastructure that we need,” he told Sky News. 

“If we had a … state Labor government that was more willing to chip in rather than continually holding out the hat for their budget failures there would be more in the tin.”

Australia is being called on to change its vaccination strategy as experts warn about limitations with the AstraZeneca jab.
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine blood clotting cause still 'unknown' but understanding the risk is simple.

Australia must change its COVID-19 vaccination strategy as AstraZeneca does not provide enough protection for the community, experts have warned.
In an opinion piece on Policy Forum, economist and modeller Professor Quentin Grafton of Australian National University, along with other experts including epidemiologist and biostatistician Dr Zoë Hyde of the University of Western Australia, put forward four changes they believe are necessary for Australia’s vaccination program.
“With the emergence of more transmissible new variants, Australia’s current COVID-19 vaccination strategy doesn’t make sense from either a public health or an economic perspective,” they write.
“It must change or Australia risks a future epidemic and/or very large costs from lockdowns when its international border reopens.”
They believe Australia needs to do four things.
1. Strengthen the country’s quarantine system by acting on the latest evidence of the role of airborne transmission in quarantine breaches;
2. Aim for herd immunity by using vaccines with the highest possible efficacy, such as Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer, as they provide security against even concerning new variants of the virus;
3. Not relax international border restrictions until everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated; and
4. Establish mass vaccination hubs in major centres to maximise the number of people who can be vaccinated each day, as Victoria is doing.
Concerns over AstraZeneca
The experts are critical of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Australia is relying on to vaccinate people over 50 years old.
“Herd immunity is the only way to eliminate community transmission for good and to avoid costly lockdowns,” they write.
“This can be achieved with a Pfizer or Pfizer-Novavax vaccination strategy, but not with the country’s current approach because it will be impossible to achieve herd immunity against several of the world’s most concerning variants using AstraZeneca.”
It notes that “real world experience” shows the Pfizer vaccine is 75 per cent effective against infections caused by the South African (B. 1.351) variant and 90 per cent effective against the UK (B.1.1.7) variant.
The AstraZeneca vaccine only has 10 per cent efficacy against the South African variant, although it’s probably still reasonably effective against severe disease.

The authors say variants threaten “both young and old” because younger people are more likely to be hospitalised.
“In other words, the risk for a 20 to 39-year-old is now similar to the risk previously faced by a 40 to 59-year-old,” they note.
“Variants also markedly increase the likelihood of dying from COVID-19; the United Kingdom variant raises this risk by 64 per cent.”
The authors, which also include Professor of Biosecurity and Environmental Economics, Tom Kompas at the University of Melbourne and mathematician and modeller Dr John Parslow, say it’s also “inequitable” to impose AstraZeneca on those who are 50 years and older.
“It knowingly gives older people, who face a higher risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19, a less effective vaccine,” they argue.
“It also runs the risk of creating a situation where the South African variant could spread in Australia’s older population should border controls be relaxed or if an outbreak should occur.
“Seychelles, which has fully vaccinated the highest proportion of its population than any country at 61 per cent – 40 per cent of the total population with a version of the AstraZeneca vaccine made under license in India – is now facing a surge of cases in which the South African variant appears to be playing a role.”
They argue that data around AstraZeneca’s effectiveness at preventing severe disease or death is also not as clear as some have suggested.
“It’s been claimed the vaccines in Australia’s portfolio are 100 per cent effective at preventing severe illness and death, but that’s not supported by science,” they write.
“There were too few severe cases in the AstraZeneca trials to accurately assess this endpoint, and the estimated efficacy lies somewhere between 72 and 100 per cent for severe illness.
“In contrast, real world experience from Israel has shown the Pfizer vaccine is 97.5 per cent effective against severe disease, with a confidence interval of 97.1 to 97.8 per cent.”
RELATED: More blood clot cases found in Australia after AstraZeneca jab
The risk of blood clots
AstraZeneca also carries a risk of blood clots and the authors note that the European Medicines Agency has doubled its estimate of the risk of blood clots for older people since the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) carried out its original analysis of the issue.
The authors believe this would have changed ATAGI’s risk analysis in the case of another outbreak in Australia (equivalent to its first wave in which there were 7000 cases and 100 deaths).
“Critically, if ATAGI had used the revised and higher estimates of blood clot risks … it would have also recommended against AstraZeneca for those aged between 50 and 60,” they write.
The authors say the Australian Government must reassure the public that the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine among those over 50 years old is necessary, and is not just being imposed to allow earlier reopening of international borders.
While a three to six month delay in reopening the international border could cost the economy $6 billion to $12 billion, it could be worth it so everyone can be vaccinated with Pfizer or Novavax rather than AstraZeneca, they say.
They point out the cost is much less than the cost of a prolonged lockdown if a major outbreak occurred, or if more frequent short lockdowns were necessary following the international border reopening.
“Australia’s vaccination strategy must change as the facts change,” they argue.
“Crucially, an AstraZeneca only vaccination strategy for those aged 50 and over will not provide the level of protection necessary to safely relax border controls, nor will it deliver herd immunity,” they said.
“The country won’t be truly safe until we’ve reached herd immunity. Reaching this threshold ensures an outbreak won’t spread rapidly in the community and lead to an epidemic.
“It also protects the millions of Australians who can’t be vaccinated due to medical reasons, or aren’t currently eligible for vaccination, such as children and adolescents.”
However, Deakin University epidemiologist Professor Catherine Bennett doesn’t agree, and believes “the vaccine you have in your arm is better than a potential one down the track”.
“AstraZeneca has fantastic efficacy on most strains,” she told news.com.au.
“To not give it when we’ve got it, is problematic to me.”
Prof Bennett said it was better to use the vaccine that was available as eventually they would all be tweaked and improved to give better coverage.
Waiting for Pfizer would push the vaccination program “well into next year” and Australia could struggle as the rest of the world opened up using vaccinations such as Pfizer or AstraZeneca.
“I don’t think cutting back on our vaccination strategy now makes public sense,” she said.
“We need to have some level of population protection and then we can build on that.”

There have been no new confirmed COVID-19 infections in NSW, but officials are still worried the virus could be spreading in Sydney.
Mother’s Day will be slightly different this year as Sydneysiders are instructed to follow strict new COVID-19 safety measures this weekend.

NSW has recorded no new cases of local COVID-19 transmission, but fears remain the virus may be lurking in the community.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Monday the eastern suburbs man who was infected last week likely had a “fleeting” contact with an unknown person described as a missing link.
That missing link would be the intermediary between the eastern suburbs man and a returned traveller from the US who has been identified as the likely source of last week’s spread.
Finding that missing link would go a long way towards easing officials’ fears that the virus may be spreading among Sydneysiders who have no idea they’re infected.

“We have tested everyone in close proximity to this gentleman (and) the contact with the infectious person must have been very fleeting,” Dr Chant said.
“So because of that we're still concerned that there may be chains of transmission in the community that are yet unrecognised.”
There were 13,768 COVID-19 tests reported in the state in the 24 hours leading up to 8pm on Sunday, a big drop from the 18,024 that were reported the previous day.
NSW Health has encouraged anyone with symptoms that could be COVID-19 – including headaches, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose, or loss of taste or smell – to get tested.
Nearly 25,000 vaccine doses were administered last week, pushing the state’s total to 786,154.
The NSW government announced on Sunday it was extending a raft of coronavirus restrictions into next week.
This means that until May 17, NSW residents won’t be allowed to drink while standing up at the pub, host more than 20 guests in their homes, dance at nightclubs or ride public transport without a mask on.
There will also be a limit of two people per day visiting aged care facilities.
One restriction was eased, however: masks are no longer mandated inside shops.

Chinese military scientists reportedly discussed the benefits of bio-weapons in a document written five years before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Chinese-language paper describes 'SARS coronaviruses' as heralding a "new era of genetic weapons".

It also claims bio-weapons could be mass-produced at 0.05 per cent of the cost of traditional arms.

People's Liberation Army scientists are among 18 people who authored the 261 page document.

National Mental Health Commission CEO Christine Morgan says the COVID-19 pandemic shone a spotlight on the need to access mental health services as it showed Australians their mental health “is as much a part of us as our physical health.” 

Better mental health support for expectant mothers will be among several measures in tomorrow’s budget designed to improve women’s health.  

“Just as we expect to get unwell physically, I think every Australian now realizes that their mental wellbeing can be negatively impacted,” Ms Morgan said. 

She told Sky News a second realisation from the pandemic was “it actually makes a difference if we reach out for help because actually if you get some services for your mental illness, your mental unwellness you actually get better”. 

“That shift in the understanding of Australians of their mental health and wellbeing and the fact that they could and should expect to be able to access services was really important.”

The NSW chief health officer has issued a grim warning about Sydney’s ‘missing link’, saying the virus could be spreading in secret.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has defended her state’s vaccine rollout program after Victoria nearly doubles the amount of jabs administered in the past 24 hours. Victoria had already established mass vaccination hubs which lead to 7,000 vaccinations administered in the past 24 hours compared to 4,000 in NSW. Ms Berejiklian defended her state’s system, and said NSW had the “strongest GP network” in Australia. “Look at the overall number of people who have had the jab, NSW traditionally has had the strongest GP network in the nation.”

Health officials are still racing to work out how a Sydney man caught COVID-19 amid concerns there are chains of transmission that continue to go “unrecognised” in the city.
“(The local case’s) contact with the infectious person must have been very fleeting,” chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant told reporters on Monday.
“We are concerned there are chains of transmission in the community that are unrecognised.
“We’re not out of the risk period.”
Dr Chant said the missing link between a returned US traveller and the man, from Sydney’s eastern suburbs, had still not been found as of Monday morning.
The man in his 50s and his wife tested positive to COVID-19 last week.
Neither have links with hotel quarantine, border control or healthcare, sparking concerns about how he caught the disease.

Health officials fear someone may have been unknowingly infectious may be going about their business in the community.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian agreed the man’s contact with an infected person must have been brief.
She said authorities have combed CCTV and spoken to “lots of people” to try and determine how he caught it, with the man even detailing the roads he had walked along to contact tracers.
“The concern is, if it’s one or multiple people, who are those missing links it was a very fleeting meeting,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters.
“That suggests there could be a high level of contagion.”

Meanwhile, lines are already forming at a mass vaccination hub in Sydney’s west as the government ramps up its jab rollout.
Located at Sydney Olympic Park, the hub will administer 30,000 doses a week in a bid to double the number of jabs distributed across NSW each week.
It will operate 12 hours a day and is staffed by more than 300 healthcare workers.
Restrictions were due to lift across NSW on Monday, but will stay in place for at least another week in the hopes of finding the ‘missing link’ before the small outbreak spreads further.
The only restriction to ease on Monday is the mandatory wearing of masks in retail settings, but workers will still be required to wear them for at least another week.
While official numbers will be revealed at 11am, it’s very likely there are no new cases of COVID-19 recorded in NSW on Monday.

The Sydney man who visited several BBQ stores before being diagnosed with COVID has been identified — and it explains everything.
NSW Health authorities have slammed media outlets for identifying the man at the centre of Sydney’s latest coronavirus outbreak. Asked about the identity of the so-called “BBQ man”, Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said she was “incredibly disappointed” to see him being named in the media. “That was not in accordance with the wishes of the gentleman,” she said. “He’s really gone above and beyond to help us and I think that it’s not a good outcome from public health. “We obviously take the approach that where we need to we will be very frank with any information but that was not necessary.” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard also weighed in on the matter, saying it was “absolutely appalling”. “No journalist should think that it’s ok to go naming a patient, somebody who’s working with Health, it’s the quickest way to destroy the confidence of all of us if we think that some journalist thinks that it’s ok to name a patient who is actually working with us to make sure the community stays safe. “It stinks actually.”

The Sydney COVID-19 patient dubbed “BBQ Man” after he visited an extensive list of BBQ stores while infectious has been named, finally providing an explanation for his shopping spree.
Investment company Apollo Global Management managing director Tom Pizzey has been identified by the Australian Financial Review as the man linked to Sydney’s latest COVID-19 scare.
Mr Pizzey is understood to have contracted the “double mutant” Indian strain of the virus earlier this month, with his wife later testing positive to COVID-19 as well.

The publication understands Mr Pizzey is still suffering coronavirus symptoms, with Apollo confirming it is assisting NSW Health in relation to a positive virus case.
“The employee has not travelled outside Australia this year,” an Apollo spokesperson told AFR.
Mr Pizzey, who is one of Apollo’s only two full-time employees in Australia, is understood to be the mystery COVID-19 case who visited multiple venues on May 1 while unknowingly infectious, including several BBQ stores.
Two of those trips were to different Barbeques Galore stores in Casula and Annandale.
The chain is in its early stages of auction and, while Mr Pizzey was searching for a new BBQ, AFR reports he was also checking out the stores for Apollo, with reports the company is considering acquiring the chain.
In the same day, Mr Pizzey also visited Joe’s Barbeques & Heating in Silverwater, Tucker Barbecues in Silverwater and The Meat Store in Bondi Junction

NSW extends COVID-19 restrictions
The new COVID-19 infection sparked panic across NSW as authorities have been unable to determine how Mr Pizzey contracted the virus.
So far authorities have connected Mr Pizzey’s genomic sequencing to a returned traveller from the US who tested positive in hotel quarantine, but they have been unable to find the missing link between the pair.
Last week, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a raft of COVID-19 restrictions would be reinstated from Thursday evening to Sunday night.
Despite NSW recording no new locally acquired coronavirus cases, authorities made the decision to extend the restrictions for another week over concerns about the missing link.
Residents are no longer required to wear masks in retail settings but the following restrictions will remain in place until 12.01am on May 17:
• Visitors to households are limited to 20 guests, including children
• Masks are compulsory on public transport and in public indoor venues, such as theatres, hospitals, and aged care facilities
• Drinking while standing up at indoor venues is not allowed
• Singing at indoor shows or by congregants at indoor places of worship is not allowed
• Dancing is not allowed at indoor hospitality venues or nightclubs however, dancing is allowed at weddings with a strong recommendation that no more than 20 people should be on the dancefloor at any one time
• Visitors to aged care facilities are limited to two people per day
These restrictions apply to Greater Sydney, Wollongong, the Central Coast and the Blue Mountains.
On Thursday, Ms Berejiklian said it was “business as usual” for anyone outside those areas but urged people to “be sensible” in a bid to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus if an outbreak was spreading undetected within the community.
“Maintain your good social distancing. Make sure you avoid large events if you’re vulnerable and make sure you exhibit good hand hygiene and most importantly make sure, if you have the mildest of symptoms, you come forward and get tested,” she said.
“What is really critical to all of us in New South Wales is to make sure that we’re on alert.”

A new survey has unveiled a concerning trend in the Australian property market, with the findings particularly bad for first time buyers.
As auction bidding continues to soar, here's what $1 million in property can net you in Australia's biggest cities.

Confidence in Australia’s property market has plummeted to levels close to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to research by comparison website Finder.
Finder analysed data collected from more than 24,000 survey respondents to uncover its Property Positivity Index.
The index, which was at 67 per cent just six months ago, now sits at 49 per cent, only minimally higher than the pandemic low of 42 per cent in April last year.
Finder’s head of consumer research, Graham Cooke, said property confidence had been a rollercoaster during the past 12 months.
“As lockdowns rolled out across Australia and open house inspections declined, Finder’s Property Positivity Index nosedived, only to recover again as the housing market sprang back to life,” he said.
“Both the rock-bottom cash rate and FOMO (fear of missing out) have turbocharged prices, but fears of a property bubble are making many Aussies pessimistic that now is the time to buy.”
However, 74 per cent of respondents still felt property prices in their suburb would continue to rise during the next 12 months.

A group of 16 experts and economists from Finder’s RBA Cash Rate Survey were asked to analyse some of the results from the survey.
The panellists were torn on whether first-time buyers who had saved a deposit would miss an affordability window if they did not purchase within the next year.
Nine of the 16 experts said first home buyers would miss out while the remaining seven said they would not.
Dale Gillham, stock market analyst from Wealth Within, said first home buyers should not be worried.
“I have never seen a time when we thought property was cheap for anyone, let alone first-time buyers,” he said.
Rebecca Cassells of Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre said buyers could miss a window if they don’t pull the trigger within the next year.
“Increased house prices driven by significant stimulus and low interest rate environment has the potential to lock out future first home buyers by making it even harder to come up with the deposit needed to enter the market,” she said.

Sky News host Sharri Markson has assessed "chilling" details from a document produced by Chinese military scientists, in which they discussed weaponising SARS coronaviruses five years before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

Ms Markson said the book was written by People's Liberation Army scientists and senior Chinese public health officials in 2015.

The documents describe SARS coronaviruses as heralding a “new era of genetic weapons” and said they can be "artificially manipulated into an emerging human - disease virus, then weaponised and unleashed in a way never seen before".

The Chinese-language paper is called 'The Unnatural Origin of SARS and New Species of Man-Made Viruses as Genetic Bioweapons'.

“The document also talks about the psychological terror that bioweapons can cause, it's chilling,” Ms Markson said. 

“To be clear ... while intelligence agencies suspect, and they've been investigating this since early last year, that COVID-19 may be the result of an accidental leak from a Wuhan lab, there is no suggestion it was an intentional release.

“The significance of this paper is that it offers a rare insight into how senior scientists at one of the PLA's most prominent military universities, where high levels of defence research were conducted, were thinking about biological research.”

Coronavirus restrictions in the Greater Sydney region have been extended until May 17 even though no further cases have been recorded after the two initial mystery infections.

New South Wales has recorded zero new locally acquired infections for the third consecutive day but authorities argue the week extension of restrictions is an important safety precaution.

Restrictions must be obeyed by residents of the Greater Sydney region, Wollongong, the Central Coast and the Blue Mountains and include a 20-visitor limit for households and a two-visitor limit at aged care facilities.

Drinking while standing in addition to singing and dancing has been banned at indoor venues and the mask mandate will remain in place for public transport. 

While restrictions have been extended in NSW, the travel bubble with New Zealand will resume due to the fact no new infections have been recorded .

The prime minister's messaging on his COVID-19 management strategy has undergone a dramatic change over the past few months to the point where he is now “smashing that panic button,” says Sky News host James Morrow.

Mr Morrison revealed to the Sunday Herald Sun he intended to keep Australia’s borders closed indefinitely saying the completion of the vaccine rollout did not guarantee a reopening.

He also acknowledged he had no plans to abandon a “zero cases” target.

Mr Morrow said the Coalition were in “full-on election mode” and “smashing that panic button as hard as they can to stay in power”.

Sky News host Rita Panahi pointed out while “this is frightening stuff ... it is electorally popular”.

EU leaders unite to call for vaccine exports, not patent waivers
Experts fear the official Indian figures are a gross underestimateSource:AFP
New Covid-19 deaths surged past 4,000 for the first time in India on Saturday in one of the world's worst outbreaks, as EU pressure mounted on Washington to end vaccine export limits and offer a concrete plan to lift patents.
"I call very clearly on the United States to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production," Macron told reporters at an EU summit in Porto. He was referring to a de facto US ban on the export of vaccine raw materials.
"I do not think that a patent waiver is the solution to make more vaccines available to more people," she said in Berlin.
Earlier, Pope Francis had focused on his desire to see patent waivers to "allow universal access to the vaccine."
The call for waivers has gained momentum after the United States announced surprise support for such a scheme to enable adequate vaccine supplies to fight Covid-19.
As India battles to stem the rising tide, Africa is fretting over a potential knock-on effect regarding vaccine supplies for the continent.
An African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team is hoping to acquire vaccines through its programme by the end of July but Nkengasong said he hoped that date could be brought forward.
Earlier Saturday, Madagascar received its first batch of vaccines through the Covax global sharing scheme, one of the last African countries to obtain supplies after months of resistance by President Andry Rajoelina.
By Saturday the global pandemic had killed more than 3.2 million people since emerging in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
But Michel, speaking in Porto, added the EU doubted the idea could be a short-term "magic bullet" and encouraged "all the partners to facilitate the export of doses".
Its coronavirus death toll now stands at 238,270,
The aim is to stop its outbreak from snowballing during the upcoming Eid celebrations at the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
In Greece, thousands of people hit private beaches, which reopened for the first time this year Saturday.
"We’ve been waiting very long to be able to receive here all the tourists and citizens that want to sunbathe and enjoy the sea," Andreas Kondylis, mayor of the southern Athens suburb of Alimos told AFP.
The global arsenal against the coronavirus expanded as the vaccine from China's Sinopharm became the first fully non-Western shot to get the green light from the World Health Organization.
In Japan, concerns remain about the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, with Japan's vaccination programme moving slowly.
But International Olympic Committee vice-president John Coates was adamant Saturday that the Games, slated to start on July 23, will go ahead.

The global threat of COVID-19 has left scientists around the world scurrying for new solutions. But this may be the strangest yet.
Dutch researchers have trained bees to detect covid-19 in test samples. Scientists used sugary-water as a reward for bees - when they indicated a positive coronavirus result by extending their tongues. Bees have a keen sense of smell and researchers hope the insects could be trained as a cheap, fast method for detecting the illness.
BERLIN, GERMANY – MAY 17: A bee in flight approaches a flower on May 17, 2019 in Berlin, Germany. May 20 is World Bee Day, which is drawing more attention this year in comparison to previous years due to the strong and ongoing decline of bee populations in industrialised nations across the globe.

The imminent threat posed by COVID-19 has seen a wide range of left-field solutions emerge out of labs over the past year as scientists scurry to stem the spread of the unprecedented pandemic.
In February, scientists at the US’ University of South Carolina developed an artificial intelligence capable of generating vaccine designs in mere seconds, a process which has historically taken years to carry out by teams of researchers.
The demand for fast and reliable testing remains stronger than ever as infection rates continue to soar around the globe, prompting a number of alternatives to the traditional PCR test. In July 2020, a team of researchers for BMC Infectious Diseases revealed dogs could be used to detect coronavirus in patients at a success rate of 94 per cent.
Now, scientists in the Netherlands have found another way to detect coronavirus: bees.
The benefits bees bring to the global ecosystem are already well-documented, but now it appears the world’s one and only suppliers of honey have added a new skill to their resume.
Controlled tests using 150 bees at the biosafety laboratory of Wageningen Bioveterinary Research revealed strong results. By using sugar water solution as a reward, scientists were able to train the bees to detect positive samples of coronavirus collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected minks.
After a lengthy training period, the bees were able to detect coronavirus in samples collected from humans.
“The bees extended their tongues to collect the sugar water solution. By repeating this action several times, the bees associated the sugar reward with the scent as the stimulus,” the report stated.
Scientists have been working around the clock to find new testing methods for COVID-19.Source:Getty Images
“With this repeated conditioning, soon enough bees started extending their tongues out for the scent alone, with no reward offered as a follow-up.”
According to InsectSense, Bees have extremely sensitive olfactory receptors that can sense volatile compounds in the range of parts per billion to even parts per trillion. This ability makes them ideal for detection of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) that might be present in the environment in extremely low quantities.
Researchers have already developed prototypes of a new machine, “BeeSense”, which can automatically train large amounts of bees simultaneously, including a biosensor that deploys the trained bees for diagnosis.

Scientists conducting the Wageningen study are confident the BeeSense could act an effective diagnostic system for developing countries with limited access to high-end technology.
“No one is saying they can replace a PCR machine, but they could be very promising,” veterinary neurologist Holger Volk told Nature.
Coincidentally, next Thursday (May 20) is World Bee Day, so don’t forget to raise a glass for the little buggers.

A WA grandmother is in hospital after developing severe bruising after receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, with health authorities investigating to see if her illness is related to the jab.
WA health authorities are investigating after a grandmother developed bruising all over her body days after receiving her first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The daughter of 80-year-old Maureen DeBoick, from near Mt Barker in the Great Southern, shared shocking images of her elderly mother’s bruise-covered hands, saying she had to be airlifted from Albany to Fiona Stanley Hospital two weeks ago for treatment.
“It started off as a spot on her tongue that got bigger overnight,” Trudy Love posted on social media. “It progressed very quickly to the inside of her gums bleeding & everywhere she touched on her body came out in a huge dark bruise straight away.
“If she rubbed it, it bled out.” Ms Love said the photographs of her mother’s hands were taken within the first two days of the condition appearing and it “progressively got worse all over her body”.
The family today said blood tests before she was taken by the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Perth showed that her platelet count had dropped to zero. “A bone marrow biopsy at Fiona Stanley has shown that Maureen is producing blood platelets, however these are not present in her blood,” the family said.
“One solution suggested by doctors is to remove her spleen.
“Maureen’s platelet count has increased slightly over the last few days to 10 and she is now responding to steroid treatment. We hope for this to continue so she can recover at home.”
A FSH spokesman said Ms DeBoick remained in a stable condition.
Ms DeBoick thanked the “wonderful” medical staff with the RFDS and at Albany Regional Hospital and FSH, saying they have taken “amazing care of her”, with the WA Health Department helping accommodate her husband and daughter.
The Department said the “case is under investigation” and said “while it is possible that vaccination was the trigger, other causes unrelated to vaccination are also possible”.
However, the Department said the condition described was not consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome — or blood clotting — a rare side-effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“There are numerous causes of thrombocytopenia, which is the medical condition described in the social media post which is currently circulating,” the Department said.
“Vaccinations, including influenza vaccination have rarely been reported as triggers for thrombocytopenia.
“So, while it is possible that vaccination was the trigger, other causes unrelated to vaccination are also possible.”
This week, there were five new cases of blood clots linked to AstraZeneca across Australia.
Health authorities say reports of the rare blood clots have developed between day four and 20 after getting the shot.
Symptoms can include blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain and unusual skin bruising and or “pin point round spots beyond the site of injection”.
Those who suffer these symptoms should seek immediate medical attention.

Dutch researchers have trained bees to detect covid-19 in test samples.

Scientists used sugary-water as a reward for bees - when they indicated a positive coronavirus result by extending their tongues.

Bees have a keen sense of smell and researchers hope the insects could be trained as a cheap, fast method for detecting the illness.

A leading expert has warned that Australia isn’t out of the woods yet and that the “virus will win” as we socialise more.
A leading epidemiologist has warned Australia’s risk of a disastrous COVID-19 outbreak is at its highest level yet.

Australia is at its highest risk of experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic over a year ago, a leading epidemiologist has warned in a bleak prediction.
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist and mathematical biologist with the University of Melbourne, said the “virus will win” with coronavirus cases expected to escape through quarantine hotels on a monthly basis.
“We will expect incursions at least once a month and more often. And while we mix more socially, the chance of one of those taking hold goes up very quickly,” he said, Nine Newspapers reported.

RELATED: Fears as Aussie put in NZ quarantine
Despite this scary outlook – largely brought about by the more contagious B117 strain first detected in Britain – Prof McCaw said vaccination against the virus will prevent an outbreak from having a “disastrous impact”.
Prof McCaw, who leads a research team providing coronavirus modelling to the Federal Government, said, it was “absolutely inevitable” the virus would spread as Australians mix more socially.
“The (B117) strain is more transmissible and it is more severe, and the severity comes to lower age groups,” he added.
Prof McCaw said vaccinations were the “game-changer” and would help to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control.
“The virus will win. But it won’t have a devastating impact if we are vaccinated,” he said.
Prof McCaw said there needed to be improvements to Australia’s quarantine hotel system but a wide take-up of vaccinations would also be needed to see a significant improvement.

“It would be unwise to think that the risk of this virus has gone once we have vaccinated (just) the vulnerable,” he said.
“Especially given that we would expect the B117 variant to come in. We could easily have a situation where our hospital system was overwhelmed with lots and lots of sick young adults.”
This week, NSW’s Health COVID-19 surveillance report revealed that six overseas travellers who reported they were fully vaccinated have tested positive for the virus while in hotel quarantine.
It said the six cases in quarantine hotels tested positive over four weeks ending on May 1, despite reporting they were vaccinated prior to arriving in Australia.
NSW Health noted all six may have contracted the potentially deadly virus prior to their vaccination becoming fully effective.
A total of 2.5 million Australians have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, according to Federal Government figures.

However, this falls well below the government’s target of having the jab administered to four million adults by the end of March.
Last month, Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan told a press conference the situation was “very real”, the pandemic “will not be going away this year” and expressed his frustration with the Federal Government at its previous refusal to cut international arrivals into WA to “crush” the spread of COVID-19 – something he’d been requesting for a month.
“Unfortunately, this pandemic will not be going away this year,” Mr McGowan said.
“And I need to do everything possible to keep our states safe and prevent community transmission.
“The situation for us right now remains very real. The new case of community transmission highlights how vital this temporary lockdown is.
“We need to give our contact tracers the best chance possible at identifying where these positive cases went and who may have been exposed.”

The Australia Olympic Committee has confirmed the Tokyo Olympic Games will go ahead despite mounting opposition as Japan struggles to contain a fourth wave of COVID-19. 

A petition to cancel the games over fears it will put lives at risk has already received more than 200,000 signatures. 

The AOC has said the playbook guidelines detail how participants and residents will be protected with all athletes restricted to staying within an Olympic bubble.

Sports stars and staff will be offered the vaccine before leaving Australia, but it is not mandatory, and the AOC is in talks with the government about what quarantine arrangements will look like for athletes when they return.

International Olympic Committee vice-president John Coates says nothing can stop the Tokyo Games from going ahead
International Olympic Committee vice-president John Coates says nothing can stop the Tokyo Games from going aheadSource:AFP
International Olympic Committee vice-president John Coates was adamant Saturday that nothing could stop the Tokyo Olympics from going ahead,&nbsp;despite ongoing risks from Covid-19.
Asked by AFP if there was any scenario in which the Games, which are due to start on July 23, could be cancelled or postponed again at this late stage, he replied: "No, there's not.
"We're working with him (Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga) on all of the safety measures. It's going ahead."
But questions continue to be raised about the viability of the Games, given the ongoing pandemic and a virus state of emergency in Tokyo and other parts of Japan being extended on Friday.
Coates, the point man for the Games as head of the IOC's coordination commission, said a huge amount of work had been done to ensure the safety of athletes and the Japanese public.
"We spent the next six months looking at the countermeasures that are necessary.
US drugs giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Thursday announced a deal with the IOC to provide vaccines to competitors and staff at the Games.
- 'Safety comes first' -
"All of the precautions that we have been taking are aimed at the health of the athletes and the health of the people of Japan," he said, denying the IOC was putting sport and financial considerations before health.
But he also admitted that not having the Japanese public fully on board was a concern.
"And the numbers (vaccinated) are very small, particularly among the elderly. So as the vaccine is rolled out in Japan, I think that will improve.
While some Olympic test events and qualifiers have been postponed, cancelled or moved abroad, others, notably the diving World Cup, have been successfully held in Tokyo with athletes from overseas.
"He tested okay before he left Tunisia, tested okay on arrival then three days later tested positive," he said.

Health authorities have pleaded with shoppers who visited a Woolworths store in Sydney’s east during a COVID-19 exposure period to get tested and “isolate immediately” until a negative result is returned.
The major supermarket in Double Bay was added to the venues list as a site where people were potentially exposed to the virus.
Those at the store between 10.45am and 11am on Monday, May 3, are being considered as casual contacts to a known infection, NSW Health said on Saturday morning.
“NSW Health has identified a new venue of concern as part of ongoing investigations into the two locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported earlier this week,” the department wrote on Twitter.
“Anyone who attended the following venue at the time listed below is considered a casual contact and should get tested immediately and isolate until a negative result is received. Continue to monitor for symptoms, and if they appear, get tested again.”

The update comes as health authorities reported zero new locally acquired cases on Saturday, with six returned overseas travellers testing positive in quarantine.
There were fears that a lockdown would be implemented over the Mother’s Day weekend after a couple in their 50s contracted the virus, with tracers unable to pinpoint how they became infected.
A man in his 50s from Sydney’s eastern suburbs tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, and contact tracing alerts from the case now cover more than a dozen suburbs across the city.
Genome sequencing has linked the man’s case to a returned traveller from the US, who had an Indian variant of the virus, but it is not yet known how the virus spread between them.

The man’s wife had also tested positive to the virus with Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday praising the man’s use of QR codes to accurately record his movements.
“This person did everything right, but it goes to show that we can't take a single thing for granted,” she told reporters during the week.
“It goes to show we have to maintain our social distancing, have to make sure we have good hand hygiene, we need to get tested with the mildest of symptoms, and very importantly and significantly, we need to use QR codes.”
Anyone who visited the following venues at the specified times are considered close contacts and should get tested immediately, and isolate for 14 days regardless of result:
BONDI JUNCTION: Screening of The Courier at Event Cinemas, Friday April 30; 6:00pm to 8:00pm
COLLAROY: Alfresco Emporium, 1021 Pittwater Rd, Tuesday May 4; 1:00pm to 1:30pm

At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular disease
At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular diseaseSource:AFP
Taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen does not increase the risk of developing a severe form of Covid-19 or of dying from it, according to a new study, the largest so far on this class of medicines.
At the start of the coronavirus pandemic there was concern over the potential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat everything from minor pain to chronic arthritis and cardiovascular disease.
The authors recommended that doctors should continue to prescribe NSAIDs as they have in the past.
"We now have clear evidence that NSAIDs are safe to use in patients with Covid-19, which should provide reassurance to both clinicians and patients that they can continue to be used in the same way as before the pandemic began."
- Death rates the same -
In March 2020, for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that people suffering Covid-19 symptoms avoid self-medicating with ibuprofen, after French officials warned that anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen effects of the virus.
Of these, 4,211 had taken NSAIDs before hospitalisation.
It also found that those who took NSAIDs were "no more likely to be admitted to critical care, need invasive or non-invasive ventilation, or require oxygen".
They also did not know how long patients had taken the drugs and whether they were taking them for a serious chronic condition or temporary symptoms.

NSW Health has revealed six overseas travellers who reported being fully vaccinated have tested positive to COVID-19 in hotel quarantine.
You might soon require a digital vaccination passport that allows people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to travel, and more.

Six overseas travellers who reported they were fully vaccinated have tested positive for COVID-19 while in hotel quarantine, authorities have revealed.
The numbers were released in this week’s NSW Health COVID-19 surveillance report as the federal government pushes forward with its vaccine passport plans.
The report states six people in the NSW hotel quarantine system tested positive over four weeks ending on May 1, despite reporting they were vaccinated prior to landing in Australia.
The figures raise concerns about the prospects of a vaccine passport system as Scott Morrison comes under increasing pressure to repatriate Australians stranded overseas.

NSW Health noted all six may have contracted the potentially deadly virus prior to their vaccination becoming fully effective.
The report stated a dose does not become fully effective until two weeks after the patient receives the second of a two-dose vaccine.
According to federal government figures 2.5 million Australians have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
But the government has received criticism for its slow roll out, falling well below its target of having four million adults given the jab by the end of March.
You might soon require a digital vaccination passport that allows people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to travel, and more.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison this week said his government was working on a prospective vaccine passport system, which would allow those with the jab to travel more freely.
He noted a condition of such a system would be proof that vaccines protect travellers against the transmission of the virus.
The success of the rollout will play a big part in any planned vaccine passport system, which would allow Australians to travel abroad.
China unveiled its digital passport system last month, with other countries including the United States announcing similar plans.
It would allow travellers to prove that they had been vaccinated in order to enter another country.
“I think (a vaccine passport) is the next step, but I do think that next step is some way away,” Mr Morrison told 3AW.
“If you’re fully vaccinated, you would be able to travel, certainly around Australia, but maybe overseas, without the need for hotel quarantine.”

The report also reveals that 89 of the 180 cases came from overseas travellers arriving from India, followed by the United States (15) and Bangladesh.
India has been racked by the virus, prompting the government to ban anyone from travelling to Australia if they had been to India in the previous fortnight.
The ban will be lifted on May 15, Mr Morrison said.
He described the ban as a “pause” and said it would end on its intended date, with repatriation flights to begin after that.
They are currently 9000 Australians in India who want to come home, including 173 children who are in the country without their parents, a Senate committee heard this week.

New South Wales has recorded zero new locally acquired cases of COVID-19, scuppering fears of a Mother’s Day lockdown.
Six returned overseas passengers in hotel quarantine tested positive among 22,153 tests in the 24-hour reporting period, NSW Health said on Saturday.
Despite the positive news of no community transmission, mystery still surrounds a couple who contracted the virus this week.
There were fears a lockdown would be implemented over the Mother’s Day weekend after the couple in their 50s tested positive, with tracers unable to pinpoint how they became infected.

It is known a returned traveller in hotel quarantine somehow passed the virus on to the couple, but authorities are yet to identify the missing link between them.
The cases prompted the NSW government to introduce a raft of mandatory health restrictions including face masks in shopping centres and on public transport.
But Sydneysiders have been urged to continue going about their daily lives while taking heed of precautions.
The following rules are in force for Greater Sydney, Wollongong and the Blue Mountains until 12.01am on Monday.
*No more than 20 people allowed inside a home.
*No singing or dancing in indoor venues, including places of worship and entertainment venues (with the exception of weddings).
*Masks are compulsory at all indoor venues, including public transport.
*Only two visitors allowed per resident in aged care facilities.
*Drinking while standing up at indoor venues is not be allowed
In an attempt to stem potential outbreaks, NSW Health on Saturday issued an alert for anyone who visited the Double Bay Woolworths on Kiaora Road between 10.45am and 11am on Monday, May 3.
Anyone who visited the supermarket at that time is considered a casual contact and has been asked to get tested immediately and self isolate until they receive a negative result.

Professor James McCaw, whose team provides pandemic modelling to the government, says it is inevitable the virus will spread.

He is warning authorities to expect continued escapes from quarantines every month especially as people start to mix more socially.

The professor says Australia has been lucky so far but it is only a matter of time until a breach overcomes the efforts of contact tracers.

The increased threat is partly due to the more transmissible British B11 strain and he says the virus will win but widespread vaccination can stop it from having a devastating impact.

The US economy added much fewer jobs than expected in April, but President Joe Biden said its recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic remains on course
The US economy added much fewer jobs than expected in April, but President Joe Biden said its recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic remains on courseSource:AFP
The United States added just 266,000 jobs in April -- a quarter of the number expected -- in a surprise setback for President Joe Biden's efforts to revive an economy blighted by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The weak hiring also pushed the unemployment rate up slightly to 6.1 percent, according to the Labor Department's monthly employment report released Friday.
Biden said such setbacks are not unusual during recoveries, and the report undermined criticism that his massive spending programs were not needed since the economy was already recovering.
He again called on Congress to approve two spending proposals costing more than $4 trillion that are aimed at revamping US infrastructure and the workforce.
While analysts say the jobs rebound may still happen in coming months, the report nonetheless complicates that assumption.
On Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 finished at record highs, with investors regarding the weak report as improving the chances Biden's spending plans are approved and the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates lower for longer.
Unemployment surged in the United States when the Covid-19 pandemic began in March 2020, but has declined in the year since, aided by the vaccines and three massive government rescue packages.
In March, Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, and is now asking Congress -- which his Democrats only barely control -- to pass a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal aimed at fighting climate change and revamping roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
The Republican opposition has generally regarded his proposals as a spending spree fueled by tax increases they see as harming American competitiveness, and lawmakers pointed to the downbeat employment numbers to make their case.
Meanwhile, some business groups like the US Chamber of Commerce argue that generous pandemic unemployment benefits are making it hard for firms to fill open positions.
- 'Racing forward' -
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Yellen pointed to a decline of nearly 600,000 in the number of people working part-time because they were unable to find full-time work, as well as an increase in average hours worked.
However, that hiring was offset by jobs losses among temporary workers and couriers and messengers, which fell 111,000 and 77,000, respectively.
After decreasing slightly in March, average hourly earnings increased by 21 cents to $30.17, the report said, an indication that shortages of employees may be forcing businesses to up their compensation.
Analysts who had forecast a big employment gain in April differed as to why this report was such a huge miss.
But she and other economists predict stronger rehiring in the months to come.
"The economy is racing forward and that is what we should focus on."

The daughter of an Aussie resident who died of COVID-19 in India has hit out at the PM saying she’s “angry” and disappointed to be Australian.
Authorities are investigating the death of an Australian permanent resident in India but it is not yet clear if the person had COVID-19. The High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell revealed the news during a senate committee where he was asked if he was aware of any Australia citizens who had died with COVID-19 in India while waiting to come home.

The daughter of an Australian permanent resident who died in India after reportedly contracting COVID-19 has hit out in an open letter addressed to Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Sydney woman Sonali Ralhan, who’s father died in Delhi on Wednesday age 59, says her father was “abandoned”.
“I write to you with so much anger brewing inside me,” Ms Ralhan wrote on Facebook.
“I am an Australian citizen and highly disappointed to be one today.
“What nation disowns their own citizens? (It) is a matter of wonder for the entire world.”
Ms Ralhan contacted embassy officials in India a few weeks ago with “great hopes” that her parents, long-term residents of Australia, would be brought home, reports Seven News.
His death came three days after the federal government’s travel ban, making it temporarily illegal for Australian citizens and permanent residents to return home from the COVID-raddled country.
On Friday afternoon, Marise Payne told 2GB’s Jim Wilson from Geneva: “Certainly extend my sympathy and that of the government to the family of this person and to so many families that we know are dealing with what is an extraordinary challenge. with infection rates surging at over 400,00 infections a day at the moment in India”.
Senator Payne later said the the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was providing consular assistance to the family but they were unable to confirm the circumstances of the man’s death.

Sonali Ralhan said in a Facebook post Thursday night that her mother was still stuck in India.
“It is with a very heavy heart and pain I need to inform you that my father has left us,” she posted.
“Now all I have left is my mother, who has been abandoned by her own government of Australia.
“We all want to cry our hearts out, but we are saving them for when we are all together again.”
Meanwhile Prime Minister Scott Morrison overnight “thanked” his friend, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after a phone call between the two leaders where Australia confirmed more medical supplies were on their way.
“We’re supporting them with ventilators and oxygen concentrators. We won’t forget India’s generosity in exporting vaccines,” Mr Morrison posted.
Just spoke with our friend, PM @narendramodi who thanked Australia for standing by India during the #COVID19 crisis. We’re supporting them with ventilators and oxygen concentrators. We won’t forget India’s generosity in exporting vaccines. We’ll work closely on global challenges.
Spoke with my friend @ScottMorrisonMP to thank him for Australia’s solidarity and support for India’s fight against the pandemic.We agreed on the importance of ensuring affordable and equitable access to vaccines and medicines, and discussed possible initiatives in this regard.
High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell was asked at a senate committee hearing on Friday whether he was aware of any Australians who had died of COVID-19 in India while waiting to come home.
“The department is aware and providing consular assistance, in accordance with its charter, to the family of an Australian permanent resident who reportedly has died in India,” he said.
“I’m advised, owing to our privacy obligations, we won’t be providing any further comment.”
Mr O’Farrell went on to explain that India had been reporting a nightly infection rate that was “greater than the population of Canberra” and he didn’t believe “anyone can put hand on heart” and say that Australian citizens or permanent residents were not among the deaths.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne described India as the “most significant hotspot” in the world but would not elaborate on the Australian’s death.
“I don’t think it’s helpful to speculate and particularly out of respect for the family,” she said.
“I will receive further advice from our posts in India in relation to that, but most importantly let me extend my sympathy, and that of the government, to the family of this person.”
Earlier it was revealed three Australian states were likely to receive rescue flights from India once a travel ban on the COVID-ravaged country ends this month, but stranded Australians who test positive to the virus will not be on-board.
Mr Morrison revealed three government-chartered repatriation flights from India will arrive in India at the end of the travel ban or by the end of May.

Anthony Albanese has launched a fresh attack on Scott Morrison, accusing him of making a critical mistake in Australia’s response to the COVID-19 crisis.

Scott Morrison’s failure to act until there is a crisis is at the centre of an opposition attack on his leadership legacy.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese is attempting to seize on a fall in popular support for the Coalition amid the backdrop of a slow vaccine rollout and revelations about the treatment of women in parliament.
Ahead of the Coalition unveiling its pitch to voters in Tuesday’s federal budget, Mr Albanese has ramped up the fight over Australia’s COVID-19 recovery – a key election battleground.

“There is no forward thinking about where we are going to be in a year or two years,” Mr Albanese told NCA NewsWire.
“He (Scott Morrison) has a characteristic, which is he waits until there is a crisis before he responds at all, to anything.”
Mr Albanese blasted the Morrison government’s response to the black summer bushfires, as well as Australia’s quarantine system, adding the vaccine rollout had taken too long.
“It is hard to understand why he said Australia was at the front of the queue for vaccines when we quite clearly weren’t,” Mr Albanese said.
“If it’s all about marketing and spin, then you don’t have a strategic approach.”

Mr Albanese plans to prosecute the case for a Labor government by spruiking a platform of secure work, better jobs and skills, not leaving people behind, and addressing climate change.
Despite the ammunition, Mr Albanese acknowledged unseating the government would be a tough fight because incumbents had an advantage during a pandemic.
However, he said compared with state and territory leaders, Mr Morrison was “not very popular at all”.
“Our primary vote is up substantially, our two-party preferred is back up, and we are competitive,” Mr Albanese said.

Rusted-on Labor supporters have accused the party of not being critical enough of the government during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
But Mr Albanese said he made no apologies for putting the national interest first, adding it was not “politics as usual”.
He hoped striking a balance between all-out attack and providing a constructive critique would be looked upon favourably by voters.
Mr Albanese said the government’s pledge to boost subsidies for parents with more than one kid in childcare, as well as their adoption of the JobKeeper wage subsidy, was proof Labor was setting the agenda from opposition.
Mr Albanese will use the opposition’s budget reply speech next week to outline new initiatives and reaffirm Labor’s pitch for a national reconstruction fund.
Asked if Labor would announce policies to help struggling first-home buyers enter the market, Mr Albanese said: “We will have more to say about housing policy, both in the weeks but also the months ahead.
“We have policies ready to roll out if the election was called tomorrow; we are ready.
“We will have a clear narrative going forward about a better, stronger, more inclusive Australia.”
Labor has committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but is yet to announce its midterm emissions reduction target.
If an election was called, Mr Albanese confirmed Labor would unveil its goal but said the United Nations Climate Change Conference at Glasgow in November was likely to change the debate.

Patients gasping for air on packed hospital floors. Welcome to the nation in the midst of a COVID crisis that may be outpacing India’s.
India has received millions in aid for the COVID-19, but reports say that some hospitals don’t have the help they need.

All eyes are fixed on India and its worsening COVID-19 crisis, but indications are the surge in coronavirus cases has now spread beyond its borders.
Neighbouring Nepal has reported a staggering 1200 per cent rise in COVID-19 infections since April, reported CNN.
Just a month ago daily cases were hovering around 300. The Himalayan republic is now confirming more than 9000 new cases per day; that is far above the previous peak of 6000 daily cases during a second spike in November.
There are fears the rate of infection may be outpacing that in India. Last weekend in Nepal, 44 per cent of all tests came back positive.
The virus is so rife, cases have been reported at the remote Everest base camp.
And just like in India, Nepal’s hospitals are bursting at the seams with sick patients while supplies of oxygen run low.
“What is happening in India right now is a horrifying preview of Nepal’s future if we cannot contain this latest COVID surge that is claiming more lives by the minute,” Nepal Red Cross chairman, Dr Netra Prasad Timsina told CNN.

How Nepal’s situation became so bad
Like India, Nepal’s government has been lambasted for allowing a series of religious festivals and other events to take place which, it’s thought, helped the virus spread.
The spike in cases has been compounded by a weak healthcare system with only 1600 intensive care beds.
Nepal’s treacherous geography also means many communities are inaccessible by road slowing down deliveries of vital medical supplies.
Ironically, the roll out of coronavirus vaccine has also been blamed for the surge. There have been claims of the virus being spread in long queues by people waiting for their jab.
Then there’s accusations of sheer political ineptitude. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been accused, for instance, of spruiking quack remedies.
The Kathmandu Post reported Mr Oil suggested gargling with guava leaves could help people rid themselves of the viruses. Drinking turmeric water was another suggestion.
Now he’s most keen on getting more vaccines into the country, at least to ensure those who have had their first dose of AstraZeneca can get their second and be protected.

The Nepalese Government in Kathmandu is now at least open about the dire outbreak.
“The situations are worsening day by day and it may go out of control in future,” spokesman for Nepal’s Ministry of Health Dr Samir Adhikari said earlier this week.
Preventing India’s COVID tsunami from crashing into Nepal was always going to be difficult.
Bar a single high altitude crossing into China, all roads lead to India. Crossing the 1770 kilometre frontier is easy, the two nations’ close relations means not even a passport is needed.
Many vital goods consumed in Nepal are trucked in by way of India. Last month, large numbers of Hindus from Nepal crossed into India for the famous Kumbh Mela festival on the banks of the mighty Ganges river.
It’s likely many brought back COVID-19 as an unwanted souvenir.

“Like a war zone”
The Nepalese Government has now put in stricter border checks and closes some of the many crossings. But the virus is already within its borders.
On Thursday, 9070 new cases were confirmed. That is far below India’s 412,000 daily cases. But Nepal’s population is also far smaller with 29 million inhabitants compared to India’s 1.3 billion.
“We need to act now and we need to act fast to have any hope of containing this human catastrophe,” Alexander Matheou, the Asia Pacific director for the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told The Guardian.

Speaking to the Kathmandu Post, Dr Sher Bahadur Pun of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital said patients were being cared for on the floor due to a lack of beds.
“It’s like we are in a war zone,” he said.
At the Everest base camp there are at least 17 cases, the BBC has reported. That’s despite the Government downplaying fears the wave had reached the lucrative tourist hot spot.
The symptoms of coronavirus can be similar to the effects of being at high altitude, meaning cases may be under reported.
The Government has ordered more oxygen cylinders from overseas and is setting up field hospitals close to the border to treat people returning from India.
A two week lockdown is currently in place in Kathmandu and public gatherings are being cracked down on.
The authorities will be hoping the moves will not be far too little, far too late.

We should not underestimate the number of people who have a vested interest in “keeping the madness” of COVID-19 going for “as long as possible,” says UNSW Economics Professor Gigi Foster.

“There are so many entrenched interests now,” she told Sky News host Chris Kenny.

Ms Foster said there are people, groups, organisations, businesses, and governments who have their “snouts in the trough” of COVID-19.

“That’s what we’re seeing,” she said.

“Someone like me, maybe someone like you, certainly many people who don’t have much skin in the game haven’t been making money hand over fist or haven’t been going up in power because of COVID, they might want to have things open as soon as possible for the benefit of themselves, their families, and even all of Australia. 

“But many business leaders, many people who are in particular positions of power where they’ve seen their power and their money just multiply during this period, do they want this rollercoaster ride to end? Of course not.

“That’s one of our big problems right now.”

Infectious Diseases Expert Professor Peter Collignon says the restrictions imposed in New South Wales so far have been “proportionate”.

No new locally acquired cases were recorded in the state, however some restrictions remain in place including a mask mandate on all indoor venues as well as restrictions on household gatherings across Greater Sydney.

Speaking on the restrictions, Professor Collignon said they have not been “overreactive”.

“We do actually need to try and see if we can work out where this thing is coming from,” he told Sky News host Chris Kenny.

“Because these cases that occur in the community and you don’t know where they’re coming from, they’re the ones that are the most dangerous.”

India has suffered through a devastating week as record daily new infection totals tumbled and hospitals were pushed to the brink.
The India controversy has highlighted some “serious shortcomings” in the federal government’s response to COVID-19, according to Sky News host Nicholas Reece. “We owe a duty of care to Australians wherever they may be in the world,” he said. “Thankfully the Morrison government has realised they made a mistake on this one, today the PM announced that the travel ban from India will not be extended beyond May 15.” Mr Reece said the federal government should have set up “large scale quarantine centres” in every single state. “The second thing is that the vaccine roll out is still proceeding far too slowly.”

India has suffered through a horror week as the country broke its daily record for new coronavirus cases on Friday.
The country reported a devastating 1.57 million new cases of coronavirus in the last seven days, Reuters reports, as hospitals were pushed beyond the brink and were forced to start turning infected patients away.
The country’s vaccination program also started to buckle under the pressure of the crisis, as the rollout was derailed by problems with transportation, and an abject lack of supply.
Infections have now spread from the crowded cities to remote villages. While India’s cities are densely populated, it’s the rural areas where up to 70 per cent of the country’s 1.3 billion citizens live.
On Friday, the country broke a record, reporting 414,188 new cases of COVID-19. Some 3915 died from the virus that day, taking the total number of deaths to 234,083.
The statistics are shocking, but medical experts believe the true scale of the tragedy may be many times greater than what is being officially reported.

Government faces scrutiny over India flight ban
The Australian government’s decision to ban flights from India this week has come under intense scrutiny, as critics said the decision was “racist” and “unlawful”.
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison defended the ban, saying the decision was made on health advice and to ease pressure on Australia’s medical and quarantine system.
He said the ban was “working”, and repatriation flights would resume after the review date of May 15.
Australian citizen dies in India
On Friday, tragic news emerged that an Australian citizen had died in India.
High Commissioner to India, Barry O’Farrell, said during a senate committee hearing it wasn’t yet clear if the person had died of COVID-19, or other causes.
“The department is aware and providing consular assistance, in accordance with its charter, to the family of an Australian permanent resident who reportedly has died in India,” he said.
“I’m advised, owing to our privacy obligations, we won’t be providing any further comment.”

Narendra Modi blamed for crisis
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for failing to suppress the second wave in the country. In January, Mr Modi told the World Economics Forum he’d saved “humanity from a big disaster by containing the coronavirus effectively”.
But critics say as the virus began to spread in the country Mr Modi allowed large religious festivals and political rallies to go ahead, which became superspreader events.
Support grows to waive vaccine patents
As vaccination rates have fallen in India amid the worsening crisis, international support has grown for a US proposal to waive patents on coronavirus vaccines.
Wealthy countries have been accused of hoarding shots, while poor countries struggle to get inoculation programs off the ground.

Under intense pressure to ease protections for vaccine manufacturers, Washington’s Trade Representative Katherine Tai said Wednesday the country “supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines”.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the announcement was “a monumental moment in the fight against COVID-19”.
Australian man trapped in India for a year
Australian man Sunny Joura has been stuck in India for a year, after he flew home to see his dying father. He is being kept away from Australia by what AFP called “one of the world’s harshest coronavirus border controls”.
Mr Joura had repeatedly tried to fly home on both commercial and repatriation flights, but had every flight cancelled. The most recent flight was one day after the most recent flight ban was introduced.
“The street that I live on — 60 to 70 per cent of households are infected with Covid. And in some cases, whole families are infected,” Mr Joura told AFP in New Delhi, where he is holed up in a house with his 72-year-old mother.
“It’s scary. Every day, we are in a way not sure whether we’re going to get it (COVID-19),” he said.

The new US position in support of lifting patents on Covid-19 vaccines has&nbsp;taken attention away from an equally significant change by Washington, which plans to open up trade in the raw materials used to make them.
After having recently taken heat for blocking such exports, Commerce Secretary Katherine Tai said Wednesday that the US government would "work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines".
Long legal and economic policy debates likely lie ahead about waiving vaccine patents, particularly at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Two labs have recently spoken out about their difficulties, laying the blame at Washington's door.
Several days earlier, India's Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, called on US President Joe Biden to step in.
There is no actual embargo on exporting vaccine components. Instead, Biden, like his predecessor Donald Trump, invoked the Defense Production Act -- which normally concerns wartime -- to confront the pandemic.
US officials have previously played down the possible effect of the law on global vaccine production.
- Dry ice and sorbitol -
At least 50 components, perhaps as many as 100, go into the jabs.
Then there are the ingredients themselves.
The shortage of raw materials is hardly surprising as the pharmaceutical industry expects to double production to 10 billion doses this year.
Companies were "beginning to report spot shortages of critical materials, raw materials, critical consumables, even equipment that is necessary for vaccine manufacturing," he said.
Already the consensus was that the free circulation of vaccine components was critical, given that a large number of countries are involved in their production.
China dominates production of the glass storage vials, while the United States leads in the manufacturing of syringes.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands is a leader in the production of dry ice used to transport vaccines that need to be kept at ultra-low temperatures.

Political pressure surrounding government responses to COVID-19 cases has made politicians such as Gladys Berejiklian, needing to "be seen like they're doing something" about it, according to Sky News host Chris Kenny.

"A number of events have been cancelled or restricted," Mr Kenny said.

"This was all over just two cases yesterday, and there have been stacks of testing over the past 24 hours, with new pop up centres and the like.

"Not a single additional case in the NSW community today."

Mr Kenny said the actual work that has kept the virus from spreading in NSW has been the contact tracing and sensible isolation of close contacts.

"We keep saying it, but every time this happens, surely we are getting closer to a sensible predictable attitude, where we learn to live with this disease," he said.

Authorities are investigating reports an Australian has died in India, as the nation is crippled by the coronavirus crisis.
The highly controversial India travel ban is poised to be lifted with repatriation flights set to resume.

An Australian has died in COVID-19 ravaged India but it is not yet clear if they had the virus, a committee hearing has heard.
High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell was asked at a senate committee hearing on Friday whether he was aware of any Australians who had died of COVID-19 in India while waiting to come home.
“The department is aware and providing consular assistance, in accordance with its charter, to the family of an Australian permanent resident who reportedly has died in India,” he said.
“I’m advised, owing to our privacy obligations, we won’t be providing any further comment.”
He said one of the reasons he wouldn’t make any further comment was because it was not yet clear how the person died and whether it was from COVID-19.

However, Mr O’Farrell went on to explain that India had been reporting a nightly infection rate that was “greater than the population of Canberra” and he didn’t believe “anyone can put hand on heart” and say that Australian citizens or permanent residents were not among the deaths.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne described India as the “most significant hotspot” in the world but would not elaborate on the Australian’s death.
“I don't think it's helpful to speculate and particularly out of respect for the family,” she said.
“I will receive further advice from our posts in India in relation to that, but most importantly let me extend my sympathy, and that of the government, to the family of this person.”
Earlier it was revealed three Australian states were likely to receive rescue flights from India once a travel ban on the COVID-ravaged country ends this month, but stranded Australians who test positive to the virus will not be on-board.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday that the government’s controversial India travel ban would be lifted on May 15, paving the way for Australians to board repatriation flights.
Mr Morrison confirmed returning travellers would be quarantined at the Howard Springs facility in Darwin but, after a meeting of national cabinet on Friday, said an offer had been extended to the states to receive repatriation flights.
“NSW, as well as Victoria and Queensland, indicated that they would be responding positively to that invitation. South Australia is also considering it very favourably,” Mr Morrison said.
DFAT has been contacted for comment.
There have been more than 230,000 deaths in India.

The India controversy has highlighted some “serious shortcomings” in the federal government’s response to COVID-19, according to Sky News host Nicholas Reece.

“We owe a duty of care to Australians wherever they may be in the world,” he said.

“Thankfully the Morrison government has realised they made a mistake on this one, today the PM announced that the travel ban from India will not be extended beyond May 15.”

Mr Reece said the federal government should have set up “large scale quarantine centres” in every single state.

“The second thing is that the vaccine roll out is still proceeding far too slowly.”

The ASX ended the week on a high note, racking up his fourth positive session in five days, with travel stocks rebounding thanks to good COVID news in NSW.
Record-low interest rates and the expectation that rates are going to stay low has “really ramped up” buyer demand, according to Anne Flaherty from realestate.com.au. The RBA left interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.1 per cent earlier this week, with Governor Philip Lowe repeating the expectation that rates will not increase until inflation is sustainably within the 2-3 per cent target range. It’s not expected the required economic conditions will be met until at least 2024. REA Group economist Ms Flaherty told Sky News the continued low interest rates have seen “strong growth” in buyer search volumes and inquiries on the website realestate.com.au. “This week that was really borne out with the latest ABS lending figures,” she said. “The ABS show new loan commitments hit $30 billion in March, this is a new record.”

The Australian sharemarket ended Friday’s trading session slightly higher, with travel stocks gaining ground on positive COVID-19 news in Sydney while tech companies continued to be hammered.
The S&P/ASX200 finished up 0.27 per cent at 7080.8 while the All Ordinaries Index gained 0.26 per cent to 7325.2.
CommSec analyst Steve Daghlian noted it was the fourth improvement in five days.
“It means we’re creeping back up to those 14-and-a-half month highs, which we hit on Wednesday, and we’re not too far away from the very elusive record highs,” Mr Daghlian said.
He said tech stocks fell for the sixth consecutive day.
“Last year, tech stocks rose by 56 per cent while the broader ASX200 actually fell by 1.5 per cent,” Mr Daghlian pointed out.
Buy-now-pay-later market darling Afterpay slid 4.14 per cent to $95.38 but smaller rival Zip Co advanced 1.81 per cent to $7.33.
OpenMarkets Group chief executive Ivan Tchourilov said heightened volatility in the tech sector had created some good trading opportunities, with Zip the single most traded stock in the BNPL sector among his company’s clients.

“Afterpay also drew the attention of traders and was the fourth most traded stock,” Mr Tchourilov said.
Geospatial map technology outfit Nearmap sank 4.97 per cent to $1.72 a day after vowing to fight a complaint in the US District Court by competitors Eagle View Technologies and Pictometry International, which allege patent infringement and seek unspecified monetary damages.
The stock plummeted 23.3 per cent on Thursday.
Accounting software provider Xero slipped 2.59 per cent to $133.75 while logistics software outfit Wisetech Global declined 3.12 per cent to $28.23.
Among the winners, Webjet jumped 7.42 per cent to $4.78, Corporate Travel Management gained 6.3 per cent to $17.86 and Flight Centre surged 7.26 per cent to $15.51.
“The good news in that space is there were no locally-acquired cases in NSW over the past day,” Mr Daghlian said.
“Having said that, some of these stocks have dropped 10 per cent over the week.”

Iron ore miners gained ground after prices for the steelmaking commodity surged to a record high overnight, breaching $US200 per tonne.
Fortescue rose 0.97 per cent to $22.97, Rio Tinto firmed 1.07 per cent to $127.11 and BHP put on 0.58 per cent to $50.09.
Results from Rio Tinto’s annual general meeting published late on Thursday showed a huge protest vote against the miner’s remuneration report, with more than 60 per cent of investors voting against big bonuses for executives and a huge payout for former chief Jean-Sebastien Jacques in the wake of the Juukan Gorge cave blast scandal.
“The board acknowledges that the executive pay outcomes in relation to the tragic events at Juukan Gorge are sensitive and contentious issues,” it said.
Rio Tinto also noted departures left it with only one board member with mining industry experience, Megan Clark, although the reduced vote for her re-election reflected her failings with the 2020 rock shelter destruction, given her role as chair of the sustainability committee.
She is also one of the two Australian residents on the board.

Gold miners benefited from higher prices for the precious metal, with Newcrest lifting 3.84 per cent to $27.33, Evolution Mining strengthening 3.9 per cent to $4.80 and Northern Star Resources adding 1.87 per cent to $10.88.
The energy sector was also in the green, with Oil Search appreciating 1.29 per cent to $3.94, Origin up 0.49 per cent at $4.14 and Woodside rising 0.48 per cent to $23.26.
ANZ firmed 0.36 per cent to $27.75, Commonwealth Bank lifted 1.05 per cent to $93.92, National Australia Bank gained 0.83 per cent to $26.78 and Westpac was 0.27 per cent stronger at $26.09.
Mr Tchourilov noted Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank all reported significant increases in cash profits and rewarded shareholders with better than expected dividends this week.
ANZ was the single most purchased stock across the OpenMarkets client base as investors chasing yield gravitated towards the company, he said.
Macquarie Group shares swung between gains and losses in response to its 10 per cent rise in full year net profit, finishing 0.35 per cent weaker at $158.45.

REA Group, which is majority held by the owner of this title News Corp and runs property websites including realestate.com.au, booked strong earnings results amid a bumper market for dwellings sales.
Shares in the company appreciated 1.44 per cent to $156.05.
News Corp also reported higher revenues, sending the media giant’s shares 4.76 per cent higher to $32.16.
The Aussie dollar was fetching 77.66 US cents, 55.84 British pence and 64.39 Euro cents in afternoon trade.

Australians stuck in India tell their horror stories as a shock number of Aussie children stranded in the subcontinent is revealed.
The highly controversial India travel ban is poised to be lifted with repatriation flights set to resume.
Australians stranded in India tell a Senate committee they’re ‘holed up’ in their homes and ‘fearing for our lives’ and urge Prime Minister Scott Morrison to let them come home. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Bianca De MarchiSource:News Corp Australia
Australians stranded in India say they’re “holed up” in their homes and “fearing for our lives” as COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc across the subcontinent.
The Australian citizens on Friday gave the distressing evidence to an Australian parliament Senate committee hearing, where they pleaded with the Morrison government to return home.
The Morrison government banned all flights from India until May 15 due to the country’s escalating coronavirus threat as hundreds of thousands of new daily COVID-19 infections were recorded.
The ban carried the threat of criminal sanctions, including five years in jail and fines of up to $66,000 for people who try to return.
But there was some encouraging news on Friday after a national cabinet meeting, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the ban would end on May 15.
The first Australians to be able to return from India will be those deemed “most vulnerable” by the Australian High Commission in India after a meeting of national cabinet.

One Australian, Sunny from Melbourne, said he’d been trying to get a flight home for the past 11 months.
He has been unable to return since flying up to see his dying father in May last year.
“It’s been 11 months of misery and I’m still stranded in India,” he told the Senate committee on Friday afternoon.
“To make things worse, my area is experiencing a tsunami of COVID infections. We are living on a street where 60 to 70 per cent of the homes are COVID infected – in some cases entire families are COVID infected.
“We stay holed up in the house in fear of our lives on a constant basis.”

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials also told the Senate there were 173 Australian children stranded in India.
Sunny feared it was “only a matter of time” before he and his ill elderly mother – also an Australian citizen – would contract the devastating virus.
“People are dying on the streets from a lack of oxygen,” he said.
“The Australian government should not abandon us in life-threatening situations.”
Sunny’s first cancelled flight was a repatriation Air India flight in July last year.
He then paid nearly $10,000 for two one-way tickets on a Japan Airlines flight to Sydney via Tokyo for April 20 of this year – but that was also cancelled.
He told the Senate he was “very disappointed” to hear about a loophole in the travel ban that allowed two Australian cricketers to return on a flight from Doha without any special permission or exemptions.
“We would have boarded our flight on the same day,” Sunny said.

Another Australian, Meg, was made redundant in late 2019 and flew to India for a two-month break at the start of 2020 but has not been able to return home.
She said she only had two days notice to fly back to Australia on the eve of an impending lockdown but told the Senate she was in a remote village where it would take at least three days to travel to any major airport.
“People are just depressed – literally just so depressed about the situation,” she said.
“Every time you make an effort to make a booking (for a repatriation flight) and don’t get a seat you just get so emotionally down and depressed.
“Every time I have tried to call the Australian High Commission to ask for help the phone will just ring out no matter how many times you call, no one literally answers.”
Deaths rose by a record 3,780 during the past 24 hours in India. Picture: Prakash Singh / AFPSource:AFP
Deaths rose by a record 3780 during the past 24 hours in India, with daily infections rising by 382,315 on Wednesday.
The number has been in excess of 300,000 every day for the past two weeks.
Mr Morrison confirmed three flights from India would arrive in Australia once the temporary travel ban ended on May 15.
All three flights would land in the Northern Territory, and passengers would quarantine at the Howard Springs facility.
Direct commercial flights would still be paused once the ban on travel from India ended.
Instead, the commonwealth asked the states to accept additional repatriation flights and the quarantine measures that followed.

A 28-year-old woman transformed her office-focused business during the pandemic to surpass $1m in revenue in just over a year.
These celebs are already wildly successful in their field, but have managed to branch out and find huge profit in their ambitious side hustles.
Natasha Giannetti was forced to transform her business during the pandemic. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Daniel PockettSource:News Corp Australia
Natasha Giannetti’s stomach sunk when employees were sent home at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, nearly destroying her freshly launched business entirely aimed at catering for office workers.
The 28-year-old Melbourne businesswoman had spent years researching, investing and finetuning her concept Snacks With Bite, a subscription-based food delivery service.
The company launched in January 2020 to provide creative healthy snacks to workers, operating much the same as milk and fruit deliveries do.
The communal snack stands were designed to be set up in offices and restocked weekly or monthly.
But after two months of operation, the business’s subscriptions almost completely dried up as employees were forced to retreated to working from home, leaving the young chief executive with a warehouse full of stock she knew she wouldn’t be able to sell.
“I was absolutely terrified,” Ms Giannetti told NCA NewsWire.
RELATED: $10m idea borne in ‘dimly lit smoky bars’
Two months after the business was launched, office workers were sent home. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Daniel PockettSource:News Corp Australia
“As you can imagine, an office subscription business wasn't the best idea when all of the offices in Australia had pretty much closed.
“Like any business owner at that time, I didn't know what was coming — I didn’t know when it would end or what the right thing to do was.”
Ms Giannetti was left with two options — effectively shut the business down and put her concept into hibernation or significantly change the business model.
She said the initial subscription-based inspiration was borne out of solving a pain point for office-based clients, so she went back to the well to figure out what that next issue for companies was.
“That’s when the next idea came,” she said, revealing her business’s pivot led to the company selling more than 20,000 snack boxes and surpassing $1m in revenue in a little over a year of operation.
“Now that people were working from home, what’s the new pain point? What’s a service I can provide that’s going to give my customers value when they’re not in the office?
“I spoke to customers and asked what were the biggest issues and the biggest theme was the fact they were noticing their employees were losing motivation from home and feeling really down.

“That's the reason we pivoted the business to work from home boxes. We changed it so we were sending boxes of snacks to employees at home to brighten up their days and thank them for working crazy hours from home.”
Ms Giannetti, who runs the business from a co-working space in Melbourne’s trendy inner-north suburb of Fitzroy, hopes the forced transformation in Snacks With Bite has given the business another revenue stream now employees have begun returning to offices.
“For a business, it's good to have as many revenue channels as possible so it’s a real positive now to know the business has legs to do both,” she said.
The 28-year-old is now focused on another issue to take the business to the next level — companies struggling to attract employees back into offices.
“A lot of employees are used to being at home now,” Ms Giannetti said.
“So the pain point that we're filling and the solution we’re giving our clients now is that it’s a really fun, healthy, nice incentive to bring your employees back to the office.
“So that's what we’re going for this year.”

India’s official virus death toll has come under scrutiny as obituaries in an Indian newspaper suggest the real figure could be much worse.
Experts have warned India’s COVID-19 crisis will get even worse, with cases continuing to rise at a terrifying rate.

Obituaries in an Indian newspaper reveal the country’s death toll could be much worse than official government statistics indicate.
A day after India set new global records for daily deaths and infections from COVID-19 with more than 4000 lives lost and 412,000 new infections, a report shows why rumours about an alleged cover-up continue to spread.
The Washington Postlooked through obituaries in a local newspaper in the western city of Rajkot for a single day in April and found there were more than 240 death notices for people who had died from COVID-19.
That figure is in stark contrast to an official government figure from Rajkot and its surrounding district which showed just 12 deaths on that day.
The Post claims crematorium statistics from three randomly selected cities showed “a wide divergence from official tallies” and “appeared to capture only a fraction of COVID-19 deaths”.

Crematoriums working day and night
News.com.au previously reported on the discrepancy between bodies and the government’s official death toll. In Lucknow, at a COVID-only crematorium, double the number of bodies arrived on six different days in April compared to government data.
“We are working day and night,” an employee said. “The incinerators are running full-time but still many people have to wait with the bodies for the last rites.”
Harvard epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding last week called the situation “extremely worrisome”.
“Deaths being suppressed,” he wrote. “At the two crematoriums in Bhopal, 187 bodies were cremated following COVID protocols in four days – all while official death toll remained at just five.”
A journalist in New Delhi earlier this week told news.com.au he is seeing “absolute carnage” and scenes that resemble a “world war-like situation” with “dead bodies everywhere”.
Tahir Ibn Manzoor said he was shocked by what he was seeing.
“It is a warlike situation where you see bodies piled up. Some are rotting with their relatives and family members waiting for hours in the crematorium grounds which are usually cramped for space with furnaces burning round the clock.”
The concerns over India’s actual death toll come as shocking statistics reveal the toll COVID-19 has had on other parts of the country.

Poverty adding to severity of crisis
A new study shows around 230 million Indians fell into poverty due to the pandemic last year with young people and women the hardest hit, and the current second wave threatens to make matters even worse.
India’s stringent months-long lockdown from last March put around 100 million people out of work, the report by the Bangalore-based Azim Premji University said, with around 15 per cent unable to find jobs even by the end of the year.
Women fared worst in that group, with a staggering 47 per cent of female workers unable to secure employment even after virus restrictions were lifted, according to the study published on Wednesday.
The report, which defined people in poverty as those living on less than 375 rupees ($5) per day, said: “Though incomes fell across the board, the pandemic has taken a far heavier toll on poorer households.”
Asia’s third-largest economy was in the throes of a prolonged slowdown even before COVID-19 struck, but the pandemic unravelled years of gains.
An estimated 50 million Indians were expected to climb out of poverty last year; instead the poorest 20 per cent of households saw their entire income vanish in April and May as business ground to a halt.
“Needless to say, the second wave is going to make things worse,” said Amit Basole, one of the report’s authors.
Many families coped with the income losses by spending less on food and taking on debt, with an alarming 20 per cent of respondents revealing that their food intake had not improved even six months later.

Pop praises ‘tireless work’ amid India’s second wave
Last year’s lockdown sparked a huge exodus of millions of migrant workers who headed home to their villages, with many planning to return after the economy reopened for business.
But one in three people aged under 25 failed to find work even by the end of the year after losing jobs in the lockdown, the study said.
As a vicious second virus wave overwhelms hospitals and triggers fresh curbs on economic activity in most of the country, millions of Indians whose lives are already precarious are likely to see their condition worsen.
The situation has concerned Pope Francis who on Thursday hailed the “tireless” work of medics in India and urged them to stay strong in a message of support for the coronavirus-plagued country.
In a message to the Catholic Bishops’ Conference in India, the pontiff offered his “heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people”.
“My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,” he said.
“I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters.
“With deep appreciation I invoke upon all of them God’s gifts of perseverance, strength and peace.”

Jeremy and Tabitha have made a killing out of a really simple concept, but they joke they are on a mission to save marriages.
Ever wanted to run your own business? Don't miss these tips on your journey to becoming a successful entrepreneur!
IsoKing managing director Jeremy Fleming and his wife Tabitha have a dream of IsoKing becoming the next Koala Living. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied
A simple idea to create flat pack desks that require no screws or allen keys has seen new business IsoKing rake in a “mind blowing” $3.6 million in revenue in just 12 months.
“We had the goal of $1 million in the first year and we blew that away in only 50 days,” co-founder Jeremy Fleming told news.com.au.
But IsoKing was born out of a mad necessity to save the event staging company, Stagekings, that he had created six years ago with wife Tabitha. Business was booming as they created sets for the likes of Ninja Warrior, the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony and at Edinburgh Castle for the Military Tattoo.
But when it was announced Australia was going into a national lockdown in March, they saw the loss of millions of dollars of work overnight.
“We faced a real prospect of losing everything, it’s a family owned business, and we talked about how realistically we were looking at losing the house and everything – it was a horrible time,” he said.
“We had to tell all the staff we had no work for them and one week later we sent them home. It was an extremely stressful time.”
But drawing on their head of design Mick Jessop’s hobby in designing furniture – who had also 3D printed his house – Mr Fleming decided to tap into the hoards of people working from home. He tasked Mr Jessop with creating a flat pack desk, which they planned to deliver on the way home from their warehouse.

A post he put out on social media about making the desks to help them “keep the lights on” changed everything. It went viral, after being shared by thousands of people and seen by millions. In a matter of days they were selling hundreds of desks and pulling in event workers who had also had their jobs decimated by the pandemic.
Over the past year, IsoKing has sold 35,000 desks, with a number of different designs ranging in price from $249 to $549, while making other requests such as shoe and wine racks, hat towers and scooter and surfboard racks.
The 43-year-old, who has three children aged 11, 9 and 6 with Tabitha, credits the success to incredible timing.
“We moved really quickly and it was around the same time public gathering bans were put in place and whole industries were having to work from home and Officeworks were sold out and Ikea had no desks,” he explained.
“Chinese manufacturers were saying 18 to 20 week lead time for a desk and it was all to do with the story too. People really connected with the story and appreciated we were having a go and because we were delivering the next day that also helped.”
Stagekings made a roaring comeback in March with a lot of film production, TV work and corporate events keeping them busy.
There’s also been requests for the company to do supermarket fit-outs, pop up stores and more commercial work on the back of IsoKing, he added.

It meant a crossroads on whether they should continue with IsoKing. But with requests for bedframes and bookcases, they wanted to take it even further, and have just launched a new range of furniture with six pieces.
All pieces are made using locally sourced sustainable birch ply, and stay true to the brand’s sleek scandi style, with easy, no tools assembly.
It’s called the Florence range, in a nod to the first stage they built for the event business, which was for the rock band Florence and the Machine.
It includes a single bedframe for $1590 and a queen size one which costs $2190, while a bedside table will set you back $325. There’s also a coffee table for $1050 and an entertainment unit retailing at $1350.
The cheapest bit of furniture in the range is a side table for $290, while the bookcase is the most expensive piece selling for $2590.
“We get so much feedback that people hate allen keys and since the very beginning that was some of the biggest feedback, how simply the desk all goes together, and that was the aim with this range,” he said.
“I joke we are trying to look after marriages as I’ve heard so many stories about people fighting over Ikea furniture.”

The future for IsoKing is to have a range that would fill up a two-bedroom apartment, revealed Mr Fleming.
“We want to have a whole range that people can put in the back of a ute or van and build in their apartment in 10 or 15 minutes, as well as really designer looking stuff,” he said. “We want to make simple, efficient systems and ranges, particularly for people that continually move around, so that’s mostly those younger uni people.”
Based in Sydney, Mr Fleming also wants to take IsoKing global and has a goal to become the next Koala Furniture.
“The big dream is that we have a really strong e-commerce furniture business. We kind of compare ourselves to Koala in a way. They have now moved overseas and we have had a lot of inquires from the US, so we are looking at exporting so we have very big plans,” he said.
“Other people have said we are the next Ikea and it’s kinda ridiculous, but it’s funny.”

Experts have revealed an unsettling theory about Sydney’s latest COVID outbreak that could mean the ‘missing link’ is never found.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has confirmed five new cases of blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine – and is investigating an additional three possible cases.

An asymptomatic vaccinated hotel quarantine or medical worker could be the missing link in the NSW mystery COVID-19 outbreak, say experts – but we might never know.
NSW authorities are scrambling to work out how a man in his fifties contracted coronavirus that genomic sequencing has traced back to a returned traveller who tested positive in hotel quarantine.
NSW health authorities have given themselves 72 hours to find the missing link between the man from Sydney’s eastern suburbs and a passenger who returned from the US before harsh restrictions are relaxed.
The man tested positive on Wednesday, and his wife on Thursday.
Professor Peter Collignon says there is the possibility that the ‘missing link’ in NSW is a vaccinated worker associated with returned travellers. Picture: SuppliedSource:News Corp Australia
Quarantine hotel workers and medical staff that are vaccinated against COVID-19 can potentially be asymptomatic and inadvertently spread the virus, says Professor Peter Collignon, from the Australian National University Medical School.
Being asymptomatic would reduce the chances a person would see for the need to get tested, as they’d have no indication they were sick.
Dr Collignon said a vaccinated person was still at risk, “but a much lower risk”, of spreading the virus. When asked if the strain they may pass on could be less severe, he replied “yes”.
“In some ways, it’s more likely (to be a worker associated with hotel quarantine), because the majority of people associated with quarantine and with the transport of returned travellers are vaccinated,” Professor Collignon told NCA NewsWire.
“Unless this ends up being from an overseas aircrew or something.
“The more we have quarantine workers vaccinated, the more of a chance one of these episodes will be related to someone that is vaccinated.
“By the same token, if we had 10 episodes due to quarantine workers before, once they’re vaccinated, instead of 10, we may have two or three and (those infected) have a less severe infection and a shorter time of spreading the virus.”
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant says they have 72 hours to find the “missing link”. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Christian GillesSource:News Corp Australia
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said has conceded so far they “can’t find any direct link between our (cases)”.
“So what we’re concerned about is that there is another person that is yet to be identified that infected our case,” she said.
In late March, a vaccinated Brisbane nurse, who was part of a cluster that forced the city into lockdown, had tested positive while showing no symptoms.
“She does work on the ward and she was tested as part of the asymptomatic screening testing process for that ward and was found to be positive,” Queensland’s chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said in March.
“She has since developed some symptoms, but she was part of that testing.”
Australian Medical Association vice-president Chris Moy could not rule an asymptomatic worker spreading the virus. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied
Australian Medical Association vice-president Dr Chris Moy said he could not rule out an asymptomatic quarantine worker being the source of the spread.
He said stifling the outbreak of coronavirus was all about reducing probabilities and that’s why it was vital for people to get vaccinated against the disease.
“Everything has to be on the table and they have to consider it, but I suspect it may be something they haven’t discovered,” Dr Moy said.
“It’s a probability game and the probability to transfer the infection if you are vaccinated is much lower.”
Both Dr Moy and Professor Collignon said it was imperative that anyone who had been vaccinated still get tested regardless of how mild the symptoms were.

US President Joe Biden was under intense pressure from world leaders which deplored the slow distribution of vaccines around the world even as 57 percent of US adults have received at least one dose
With soaring Covid-19 rates in poorer countries like India, pressure is on for Big Pharma to waive vaccine patent protectionsSource:AFP
Waiving patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines is fiercely opposed by Big Pharma because they say it would set a precedent that could threaten future innovations, and insist the move would not speed up production.
Here are some of the consequences waiving the patent protection on novel coronavirus vaccines could have.
The vaccine makers say patents are not the key factor impeding faster production.
Mastering the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is the basis of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, buying equipment, conducting clinical trials, and setting up large-scale manufacturing -- all of this takes time.
Vaccine production also is hampered by customs barriers and shortages of certain ingredients.
Waiving the patents "doesn't mean that countries like India could just speed up manufacturing hundreds of millions of doses," so it is "not going to hurt them materially in the months ahead," says Ian Gendler of the Value Line research firm.
"They're not doing it voluntarily," said Farasat Bokhari, a health economist specializing in competition at Britain's University of East Anglia.
- 'Slippery slope' -
"How will new vaccines come," he asked on Twitter. Alzheimer's is a global crisis, as is cancer. "Which will be next to have patents broken when this precedent is set?" he asked.
But waiving patents for Covid-19 vaccines "sets the path and the precedent for removing it for other public emergencies in the future as well," Bokhari said -- because it would remove the "incentives ... for firms to invest next time."
For Damien Conover, a pharmaceutical sector analyst at Morningstar, the patent waiver is "more optics" for the Biden administration, which "is showing support with the developing world, rather than really having a major impact."
"We still need to solve that problem," Bokhari said. "We need to see where the bottlenecks are, why is it that production is not increasing."
Shyam Balganesh, intellectual property specialist at Columbia University in New York, favors pooling knowledge of Covid-19, since the virus is not going to disappear anytime in the near future.
Balganesh cautioned that the final outcome of the negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) remains unclear.
How long the vaccine patent waivers will be in place, or whether Covid-19 treatments will be covered by the waiver are among the "wrinkles (that) have to be ironed out."

Developers are tussling to take over a Kensington project fast-tracked to stimulate Victoria’s COVID-19 recovery.

Development “giants” and super groups are tussling to take over a Melbourne project fast-tracked to boost Victoria’s economy in the wake of COVID-19.
Last year authorities brought forward approvals for more than $1bn in large projects to stimulate construction jobs, including a $70m, six-building precinct slated for 346-350 Macaulay Road, Kensington.
After 10 subsequent unsolicited offers for the 424-apartment development, its proponents United Asia Group have listed it for sale.

They paid about $35m for the 8803sq m site, formerly home to Vision Australia, in 2018.
With plans and permits in place it is expected to snare close to $50m.
UAG founder Nicole Chow said they had fielded offers from development “giants” and “institutional groups” who “want to do it quick”.
Ms Chow added that with another project underway in West Melbourne and work shortly starting on a Toorak project, they already had construction commitments in the city.

“This is the first time we have done this, it’s an unusual situation with COVID-19,” Mr Battersby said.
“(And) our display suite is almost done on site, so we may still develop it.”
JLL’s Victorian head of middle markets and metropolitan investments Josh Rutman is working on the sale and said “build-to-rent players are making offers”.
“They like the idea of the precinct plan, and having good retail on the ground floor — plus with the two train stations it’s got a lot going for it,” Mr Rutman said.
He was not able to name groups who had made approaches due to the ongoing sales process, but said they included the Australian and international groups most actively pursuing build-to-rent options across the city.

It has been designed by Battersby Chow Studio architects and Hayball Architects, while landscaping will be overseen by Openwork.

More restrictions will ease across Victoria, with the move allowing more people inside bars, restaurants and nightclubs.
Sky News host Peter Gleeson says &quot;the hotel quarantine fiasco in Victoria is real&quot;, the Coate Inquiry was &quot;essentially a whitewash&quot;, and the system needs a royal commission. A senior Andrews government bureaucrat managing infection prevention across Victoria's hotel quarantine program has been reported to authorities twice since March after defying a Defence Force request for a mandatory COVID-19 test and breaching infection-control protocols. PR Counsel Principal Kristy McSweeney said Victorian taxpayers should not forget the parade of ministers walking in front of the inquiry, backed by barristers and various QCs to defend ministers &quot;and not tell us anything at all&quot;.

Victorians are set for a further easing of COVID-19 restrictions as the state enters its 69th consecutive day without recording a locally acquired case.
From May 28, small to medium-sized venues will be able to have up to 200 people per space without any density limit.
The state government announcement on Friday morning means the state’s live music venues, restaurants, bars and nightclubs will be able to welcome more patrons following a year of strict restrictions.
The changes would apply for spaces that are 400 square metres or below, with larger spaces still needing to follow density limits.
But Victorians were urged to ramp up their use of the QR code service after health officials expressed concern at “low rates of check-ins”.

A recent state government study showed just 41 per cent of visitors to hospitality venues checked in every time, while 24 per cent of sites visited by authorised officers between April 30 and May 2 were warned or received notices due to lack of compliance with electronic record keeping.
“This change means checking in will be quick and easy and ensure the data is high quality and easily available to our contract tracers should any venue be listed as an exposure site,” Health Minister Martin Foley said.
Government Services and Creative Industries Minister Danny Pearson welcomed the announcement.
“This is great news for many live music venues, restaurants and nightclubs who can open the doors to up to 200 people per space – but getting every Victorian to check in using the QR code service is the goal,” he said.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed the India travel ban will be ending on May 15 but flagged no changes would be made to the "biosecurity orders" in the interim.

Mr Morrison said the travel ban worked to get the number of infections in the Howard Springs quarantine facility to “more manageable levels” and will be at a level which allows the restarting of flights.

“As planned we will be able to return to having those repatriation flights from India from the 15th of May,” he said. 

Mr Morrison also said the controversial Biosecurity Act which made it illegal for Australian citizens to enter the country for the first time in Australia’s history “has been highly effective” but will not be changed before they end on May 15.

“There will be no change to the biosecurity orders that we have put in place which were put in place to run to the 15th of May, that biosecurity order is working exactly as it was intended to and it will remain in place with no change until the 15th of May. 

Mr Morrison said there would be three repatriation flights in May and all returning travellers would be tested for COVID-19 before boarding.

An 11am update will reveal whether Sydney’s outbreak has spread further – but the NSW Premier has already hinted it could be good news.
Mother’s Day will be slightly different this year as Sydneysiders are instructed to follow strict new COVID-19 safety measures this weekend.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said she is “pleased” with the COVID-19 outbreak numbers that are expected to be presented at 11am. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Christian GillesSource:News Corp Australia
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said she is “pleased” with the COVID-19 outbreak numbers that are expected to be presented at 11am.
The planned news conference will reveal whether Sydney’s coronavirus outbreak has spread further after an eastern suburbs couple tested positive and sent health officials on a wild scramble to map their movements.
But Ms Berejiklian has already given a hint as to what the day might bring. She gave interviews to two morning television shows on Friday.
“Obviously we give our updates 11am and suffice to say very I'm pleased with where things are at,” Ms Berejiklian told Channel 7’s Sunrise program.
“I’m pleased with the way the community has responded, I’m please with what (NSW) Health is doing.
“We’ll be able to confirm everything at 11am but suffice to say I am pleased with how the situation is unfolding.”
"I'm very pleased with where things are at and we'll be able to confirm everything at 11am" NSW Premier @GladysB hints that her state recorded low or no new community coronavirus cases on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/kdpXXARG5v
She said she preferred to wait to give a proper update until 11am because things might change before then.
NSW Health tallies coronavirus statistics by 24-hour periods that end at 8pm on the night before each announcement.
But sometimes when there have been community cases confirmed after that cut-off, authorities have announced them ahead of time.
Ms Berejiklian said despite the “pleasing” outcome, officials are still worried that there is at least one person in the community who has the virus and might be spreading it.
While officials have been able to figure out that the eastern suburbs couple were infected with the same virus as a returned traveller from the US, they don’t know who could have been the conduit between them.
The so-called missing link is one of the government’s greatest worries at the moment.
“It’s a mystery at the moment. We don't know who it is. It could be more than one person, it could be a worker that has passed it onto someone else, who has passed it onto someone else,” Ms Berejiklian said.

Health authorities have given themselves 72 hours to find the missing link between a man from the eastern suburbs in his 50s, diagnosed on Wednesday, and a returned traveller from the US before harsh restrictions imposed on the state in a bid to control the outbreak expire.
The new restrictions on bars, indoor gatherings and aged care facilities were brought in on Thursday afternoon, after the man and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus – marking the state’s first cases of local transmission in more than a month.
Residents were told they were required to adhere to the following public health guidelines until midnight on Monday:
Health officials have also added to a growing list of “venues of concern” where they believe people could have been exposed to the risk of the virus.
The Haymarket restaurant XOPP was the latest to be added to the list on Thursday night, and anyone who was there between 1.30pm and 2.30pm on April 28 has been urged to get tested.

The man at the centre of a wild bubble tea brawl that went viral on the internet didn’t turn up to his first court appearance. This is why.
CCTV footage of an assault at bubble tea shop FunTea on Gouger St, Adelaide.

The man at the centre of the Adelaide bubble tea brawl, who was filmed allegedly slapping an employee in the face, was a no-show to his first court appearance after getting a COVID-19 test.
Lei Guo, who is also known as Gavin Guo, was arrested and charged with basic assault after footage of the violent tussle at FunTea in Adelaide’s CBD emerged on social media in early February.
The accused, 39, was bailed to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Friday but did not attend.
The shocking video of the alleged assault at the Gouger St bubble tea shop went viral on the internet. Picture: RedditSource:Supplied
His lawyer produced a medical certificate and told the court that this client was self-isolating as he waited to receive results from a recent coronavirus test.
He asked for an adjournment as matters were “likely to resolve”.
Magistrate Simon Smart asked the police prosecutor if he should issue Mr Guo with a “non-appearance”.
“Under the circumstances, your honour, I don't think (so),” the prosecutor said.
Mr Guo’s lawyer made no comment as he left the court and did not elaborate on his vague comment about the matter resolving.
An Adelaide Chinese community representative Keith Jin sat in on the hearing as a spectator.
He later told reporters that the Chinese community was “very angry” about the situation.
“The whole community feels bad,” Mr Jin said.
Shocking footage has emerged of a brawl over an alleged pay dispute in an Adelaide bubble tea store.
The video – which is all in Mandarin – shows the victim, a female international student, first arguing with a man in a grey top.
A separate man in a black T-shirt begins arguing with the worker and then whacks the woman in the face, escalating the situation inside the Gouger Street business.
The footage shows the victim throwing what appears to be a black bag, which hits the light on the roof. She then yells at the man and starts to hit him back.
She is then kicked to the ground as others inside the business begin to tussle with each other.
Customers, including children, witnessed the brawl.
After the incident went viral on the internet, the FunTea owners taped a note to the store’s front window and denied claims the argument was over employees’ pay. They said it arose from a prior argument between the woman and Mr Guo, who was a customer.
“The management and owners of Fun Tea deplore violence of any sort, and have zero tolerance for assaults or violence,” the statement read.
It sparked the two female employees who were impacted by the wild brawl to speak out, issuing a public statement claiming they were victims of wage theft and earned between $10 and $12 an hour as casual employees when the legal minimum rate in a restaurant is $25.51.

A protest was later held out the front of the Chinatown store calling for an end to all wage exploitation and theft.
FunTea took to social media to announce on March 13 that the store was under new management.
Mr Guo is due to reappear in court in July.

Sydneysiders will again be blocked from travelling to many other states after a COVID-19 outbreak in the city.
You might soon require a digital vaccination passport that allows people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to travel, and more.

People who have visited a Sydney exposure site will be shut out of most other states even as internal borders remain open to the majority of NSW residents.
The rest of Australia has been watching the situation in NSW closely after an eastern suburbs couple both tested positive to COVID-19 without any clear explanation as to how they were infected.
NSW Health has compiled a long list of places the pair visited while potentially infectious and have told anyone who was there at the same time as the couple to get tested and self-isolate.
Depending on the location visited, people were advised to stay isolated until receiving a negative test result, for 14 days regardless of result, or until receiving advice from the health department.

The other states and territories have made a distinction between those potential exposure sites and the rest of NSW as they’ve made decisions about allowing travellers in.
New Zealand – one of the few other places where NSW residents could conceivably travel – have hit “pause” on the travel bubble following the Sydney community spread.
Flights from NSW to New Zealand were suspended from 11.59pm Thursday for 48 hours.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
South Australia has said it will shut out anyone who has visited an NSW exposure site.
The new rule has been in place since one minute after midnight on Friday.
People who have already entered SA and who have been to an exposure site must quarantine for two weeks “at a place determined by an authorised officer”.
They will also be made to get tested for COVID-19 right away, and then again on day five and day 13 after arrival in the state.
Masks must be worn when getting tested.

VICTORIA
Victoria has recommended anyone who has been to an exposure site in NSW to reconsider travel plans down south.
If any of those people have already entered Victoria they will be made to quarantine for 14 days.

QUEENSLAND
Queensland has said from Friday morning, anyone who has been to a NSW exposure site will be placed into hotel quarantine for a fortnight.
People who were already in Queensland before Friday morning, and who have been to an exposure site, were asked to quarantine at home and get a COVID-19 test.
People who have visited NSW since April 27 should monitor for symptoms.
NSW Health has released a list of exposure sites dating back to 27 April 2021 related to two new locally acquired cases. This list is steadily being updated as more information becomes available: https://t.co/jkGK8ATbaepic.twitter.com/lF7qTN0SWG
WESTERN AUSTRALIA
People who have arrived in Western Australia and who have visited an NSW exposure site should get tested immediately and quarantine for 14 days from the time of potential exposure.
The WA government has asked recent arrivals from NSW to monitor the NSW Health website to see if new locations are added.

AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY
The ACT will make anyone who has been to a NSW exposure site get tested immediately and quarantine for 14 days from the time they were there.
The territory has also said anyone who has been to the greater Sydney region – which includes the city itself, as well as Wollongong, the Central Coast, and the Blue Mountains, will not be allowed to attend work if they work in high-risk settings such as aged care facilities, prisons and hospitals.
That rule will be in place for anyone who was in greater Sydney since April 26 and count for 14 days from the time they were there.

Sydneysiders woke up in a city on edge as health officials scramble to contain an outbreak – and the next 72 hours will be crucial.
Mother’s Day will be slightly different this year as Sydneysiders are instructed to follow strict new COVID-19 safety measures this weekend.

Sydneysiders woke up under new restrictions and on high alert on Friday as residents anxiously waited to see if a local COVID-19 outbreak would spread further.
Health authorities have given themselves 72 hours to find the missing link between a man from the eastern suburbs in his 50s, diagnosed on Wednesday, and a returned traveller from the US before harsh restrictions imposed on the state in a bid to control the outbreak expire.
Urgent genome analysis results returned to NSW Health less than 24 hours after the man was confirmed infected showed the likely source of his infection was a returned traveller from the US who was taken into special health accommodation after testing positive upon their return to Australia.
It’s not known, however, how that person came to infect the eastern suburbs man and officials worry there is a “missing link” out there who might not know they’re infected.
“We can’t find any direct link between our (cases),” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“So what we’re concerned about is that there is another person that is yet to be identified that infected our case.”

New restrictions on bars, indoor gatherings and aged care facilities were brought in on Thursday afternoon, after the man and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus - marking the state’s first cases of local transmission in more than a month.
They will be in place at least until one minute after midnight on Monday, signalling the state government’s hopes the situation will have been brought under control within the next three days.
“We believe this is a proportionate response to the risk ahead of us,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
The Premier called for anyone experiencing any symptoms of the virus - no matter how mild - to come forward and get tested to give contact tracers the best chance of stopping the outbreak before it gets out of control.
Dr Chant said the health department believed the virus strain originated in India.
However, it was not currently considered a “variant of concern” - the term the department uses for certain highly transmissible versions of the coronavirus such as those that originated in the UK and South Africa.

From Thursday, residents of greater Sydney were forced to strap on masks again if they wished to visit public indoor places.
Residents were told they were required to adhere to the following public health guidelines until midnight on Monday:
Health officials have also added to a growing list of “venues of concern” where they believe people could have been exposed to the risk of the virus.
The Haymarket restaurant XOPP was the latest to be added to the list on Thursday night, and anyone who was there between 1.30pm and 2.30pm on April 28 has been urged to get tested.
Many Sydneysiders would have been forced into isolation as a result of the transmission concerns, including the NSW Treasurer who had coffee at a restaurant where the eastern suburbs man was lunching separately on Friday and who returned a negative test for the disease.

"Patents are not the limiting factor for the production or supply of our vaccine.

The NSW government's response to another case of community transmission of the coronavirus is "proportional" and has a "likelihood" of getting control of the spread, according to Infectious Diseases Expert Professor Peter Collignon. 

"Well, I think they've adopted a proportional response to what the level of risk is at the moment. There is still one person we haven't found," he told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.

"But equally 80 per cent of people don't really transmit this to others. 

"Secondly, because they get the population on side and comply it decreases the chance of having a super spreading event because they're limiting indoor crowds- particularly without masks.

"And on top of that - so far the people in Sydney in all the past outbreaks have responded very well in getting testing when anybody has any symptoms - and they have been able to get control of this."

Police in Delhi have praised Assistant Sub-Inspector Rakesh Kumar, who they said has “helped over 1,100 last rites” in the past few weeks as the city, along with the rest of India, battles a crippling wave of COVID-19 infections. Delhi recorded 20,960 new COVID-19 cases in one day, a record high, officials reported on May 6. The capital territory recorded 311 deaths on the same day. The number of confirmed cases reported nationally on May 6, 412,262, was also a record. It brought the number of active cases in the country to 3,566,398. This footage shows police on duty at a Delhi crematorium. Staff at the city’s Lodhi Crematorium told local media that they were receiving 60 to 100 bodies to be cremated every day, exceeding their 47-body capacity.

"Okay, this particular fellow went to more places in one day than most people would go in a week," he said.

"But I can't remember at any stage during this pandemic where we've had these restrictions brought in over what is basically one sole case."

Australia’s IPL stars have been safely transported out of India, but one Test great remains stuck in the coronavirus-ravaged country.

Australia’s Indian Premier League stars have been safely transported out of India, but Chennai Super Kings coach Michael Hussey remains stuck in hotel quarantine after testing positive to COVID-19.
On Tuesday evening, the glamorous T20 tournament was suspended after several players and staff tested positive to the virus.
The decision left 38 Australian players, coaches, commentators and umpires stranded in coronavirus-ravaged India, unable to return home due to the Government’s strict travel restrictions – which will not be uplifted until May 15 at the earliest.
On Thursday, Cricket Australia confirmed the Aussie talent — including David Warner, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins and Ricky Ponting — were on route to the Maldives, approximately 2800 kilometres south of India.
“The Australians will remain in the Maldives until the conclusion of the travel pause pertaining to flights from India to Australia. As previously stated, CA and the ACA are not seeking an exemption from the Australian Government,” the statement read.
“CA and the ACA extend their sincere thanks to the Board of Control for Cricket in India for their responsiveness in moving the Australians from India to the Maldives less than two days after the decision to indefinitely postpone the Indian Premier League.”

According to the Maldives’ Ministry of Tourism, visitors from India are not required to quarantine in order to travel to the island resorts, but must return a negative result.
BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal reaffirmed the country’s commitment to repatriating the competition’s international players.
“We stand by our word that for us, the IPL is not complete until our players and officials reach their homes safe and secure,’’ Dhumal said.
“We are working on that and will come out with a detailed plan in two days.”
I left India 🇮🇳 today with such a heavy heart!! I know you are all hurting. I will do everything I can to support you and I will be back as soon as I can, standing beside you once again. #incredibleindia#staystrong#youarenotalonepic.twitter.com/g70dTaB6Le
Meanwhile, several English IPL players landed back in the UK on Wednesday and have commenced their mandatory 10-day quarantine.
Hussey will be required to undergo a 10-day quarantine in his hotel room after the former Test batter’s two COVID-19 tests returned positive results.
Super Kings chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan, bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji and a bus cleaner also tested positive this week.
“Mike Hussey remains in India having tested positive to COVID-19. Mike is experiencing mild symptoms and is in the care of his IPL franchise, the Chennai Super Kings,” the CA statement read.
“CA and the ACA will work closely with the BCCI to ensure Mike’s safe return to Australia when it is safe to do so.”
The Courier-Mail reported that the Super Kings are hoping to move Hussey from Delhi to Chennai by air ambulance to support his recovery.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, ACA chief executive Todd Greenberg said some of the Aussie players and staff were anxious about the travel ban, and eager to return home as soon as possible.
“They always knew when they’d have to do isolation when they came back into the country. They didn’t expect the borders to be closed, and that created some anxiety for them,” Greenberg said.
“They’re very hopeful that the Government will reopen after the 15th, but we’re under no illusion that’s the decision the Government has to make.
“The public will see our best Australian athletes as superheroes. They’re brilliant athletes and great cricketers, but they’re human beings. They’re people.
“Some of them are husbands and fathers, and they’re under enormous amounts of stress over there.
“This will be an experience that they probably will never forget.”
India is recording approximately 360,000 cases and 3500 deaths a day and has been hit by chronic shortages of hospital beds and oxygen.
On Thursday, Australian Minister for Agriculture David Littleproud hit back at Michael Slater after the former Test cricketer attacked Prime Minister Scott Morrison for not allowing Australians to fly home from India.

The NRL will re-implement biosecurity protocols in response to Sydney’s recent case of community COVID-19 transmission.
From Friday afternoon, players are required to remain home unless training, exercising or shopping for essentials.
Players and staff must also adhere to restrictions reintroduced by the NSW government, including wearing face masks indoors.
In a statement released on Thursday evening, NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said he hopes the new restrictions would only be required for the short term.
Abdo remains hopeful all clubs will be able to travel interstate for Magic Round next week, which sees all 16 teams competing at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium rather than at stadiums across the east coast.
“These are strong measures to ensure our players remain healthy and the competition can proceed without interruption. We are hopeful Level 3 restrictions will only be implemented for a short time, but it is important to take this step as a safeguard measure, particularly with all clubs travelling to Brisbane (for Magic Round) next week,’’ Abdo said.
“The restrictions we have put in place also reduces the risk of a player attending a venue which may lead them to being identified as a close or casual contact.”

All Sydney clubs are subject to the new restrictions, as are the Melbourne Storm, who are in Sydney for their match against the Rabbitohs on Thursday night.
The Gold Coast Titans will play in Sydney on Saturday, and will also be required to abide by the restrictions during their time in the Harbour City.
As the new COVID-19 case visited a number of locations in the Eastern Suburbs, players and staff at the Sydney Roosters underwent COVID-19 tests on Thursday as a precaution. So far, none have tested positive.

Sky News host Chris Kenny says it’s “all about the infection count” for journalists and politicians even though “no one is actually sick”.

Greater Sydney will be subject to additional COVID-19 restrictions as of 5PM Thursday, after recording two coronavirus cases.

“For the Mother’s Day weekend, there is no lockdown for Sydney, but there is what I would call the Taliban trifecta – no dancing, no singing, and no drinking – at least while you’re standing up for some reason,” Mr Kenny said.

“Despite the pragmatism of New South Wales now and in the past, people are already cancelling their travel plans to Sydney because they know from past experience that their own states could leave them stranded away from home at the drop of a hat.

“It just goes to show that after 16 months of the pandemic - despite how well this country’s managed it - we are going backwards in this country in some of our responses and public debate.”

China on Thursday cut off a channel for diplomatic and trade talks with Australia in a largely symbolic act of fury, following clashes over a wide range of issues including human rights, espionage and the origins of Covid-19.
Canberra has previously described the avenue for talks -- designed to boost trade between both sides and introduce large Chinese investors -- as one of the "premier bilateral economic meetings with China".

The ASX sank into the red after tech stocks were hammered, with the NSW COVID situation and a bombshell from China dragging down sentiment.
Australia's government has hinted an awful lot about a war with China - but experts point to a different motive behind their statements.

The Australian sharemarket slumped for the first time this week, with technology stocks proving a big weight while sentiment took a hit from the worsening COVID-19 situation in NSW.
The S&P/ASX200 closed 0.48 per cent lower at 7061.7 while the All Ordinaries Index gave up 0.52 per cent to 7306.
CommSec analyst James Tao said the local bourse opened in positive territory but pulled back as news of community spread of COVID-19 in Sydney and three days of restrictions flowed through.
Losses were across the board, excluding the resources sector amid firmer oil and iron ore prices.
Mr Tao said tech stocks dragged on the market, with buy-now-pay-later market leader Afterpay slumping 6.98 per cent to $99.50 and closing below $100 for the first time this year. Smaller rival Zip Co slid 5.88 per cent to $7.20.
OpenMarkets Group chief executive Ivan Tchourilov said Zip was the single most sold stock across his company’s client base on Thursday.
“It seems investors are becoming weary of the lofty valuations the sector inherently carries and are clearly looking for value elsewhere,” he said.

Artificial intelligence data services firm Appen plunged 21 per cent to $11.63 after delivering a presentation to a conference.
Trading in Appen shares were paused in response to the plunge and the company told the ASX it had no explanation but pointed to the recent technology stock price slump in the US, saying that may have dented sentiment around the sector in Australia.
Geospatial map technology outfit Nearmap plummeted 23.3 per cent to $1.81 after competitors Eagle View Technologies and Pictometry International filed a complaint in the US District Court, alleging patent infringement and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
Chief executive Rob Newman said Nearmap believed the allegations were without merit and would vigorously fight the complaint.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it planned to knock back a proposal by Qantas and Japan Airlines to co-ordinate flights between Australia and Japan under a five-year joint business agreement, which chair Rod Sims said breached competition laws “at the expense of consumers”.

Reflecting on major news China had suspended a key agreement with Australia for regular dialogue between political leaders on economic issues, Mr Tchourilov said it “may be the catalyst for the infamous ‘sell in May and go away’ seasonal weakness to really start to kick in”.
“It’s not a good sign when the world’s second largest economy basically says they don’t want to do business with you, but the reality is we still have a lot of things they need – such as iron ore – so it’ll be interesting to see where we go from here,” he said.
The Aussie dollar was buying 77.4 US cents, 55.66 British pence and 64.44 Euro cents in afternoon trade.

India’s worsening catastrophe has reached new heights, with a record 412,262 new cases and 3980 deaths recorded and dashing hopes.
India has received millions in aid for the COVID-19, but reports say that some hospitals don’t have the help they need.

India saw record new jumps in COVID-19 cases and deaths on Thursday, dashing tentative hopes that the catastrophic recent surge was easing.
Health ministry numbers showed 3980 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the national total to 230,168, and 412,262 new cases, bringing India’s caseload since the pandemic began to 21.1 million.
Many experts suspect that with low levels of testing and poor record-keeping for cause of death — and crematoriums overwhelmed in many places — the real numbers could be significantly higher.
The rise follows several days of falling case numbers that had raised government hopes that the virus surge may have been easing.
Having hit a high of 402,000 last Friday, the daily number of coronavirus cases eased to 357,000 before creeping up again on Tuesday.

Senior health ministry official Lav Aggarwal had told reporters on Monday that there was a “very early signal of movement in the positive direction”.
The sharp rise in cases since late March has overwhelmed hospitals in many places, with fatal shortages of beds, drugs and oxygen.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has resisted imposing a new lockdown although several regions including the capital New Delhi, Bihar and Maharashtra have imposed local shutdowns.
Until now the worst-hit areas have been Delhi and Maharashtra but other states including West Bengal, Kerala and Karnataka are now reporting sharp rises.

K. Vijay Raghavan, the Indian government’s principal scientific advisor, said on Wednesday that the country of 1.3 billion had to be ready for another wave of infections after the current one.
“Phase 3 is inevitable given the high levels of circulating virus. But it is not clear on what timescale this phase 3 will occur. We should prepare for new waves,” Mr Raghavan told a news conference.
With the government facing criticism as patients die outside hospitals, consignments of oxygen and equipment have been arriving from the United States, France, Britain, Russia and other countries in recent days.
But India will need yet more oxygen from other countries to fight the surge until numbers stabilise, another government official said Monday.

“We did not and do not have enough oxygen,” the top government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “If we could get more oxygen more lives would be saved.”
Overnight, 11 people died in a hospital near the southern city of Chennai after pressure dropped in oxygen lines, the Times of India reported on Thursday, the latest in a string of similar incidents.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has called for “urgent” international action to prevent “a worsening human catastrophe” across South Asia.
It highlighted the case of Nepal, where it said “many hospitals are full and overflowing” with COVID-19 patients and the daily caseload is 57 times higher than one month ago.
The National Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday meanwhile that the UK strain of COVID-19 was more dominant in north India, while the new Indian variant known as B.1.617 was more prevalent in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat, reports said.

A date for a hearing against a controversial federal government declaration has been rapidly set as a man stuck in India challenges it.
Australia’s controversial India travel ban is meant to protect our healthcare system, but experts have warned it could have unintended consequences.

A court challenge against the federal government’s controversial ban on Australians returning home from COVID-19-ravaged India will be heard before the order expires.
Gary Newman, 73, is stranded in Bangalore and has instructed lawyers in his homeland to file an urgent challenge against the direction that could jail Australians or fine them up to $66,000 if breached.
Mr Newman, from Melbourne, travelled to India in March 2020 to visit friends and has been stuck there ever since.
His legal team, barrister Christopher Ward SC and solicitor Michael Bradley, are set to argue it is unconstitutional to shut citizens and residents out of their own country.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced the order last week. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Ian CurrieSource:News Corp Australia
On Thursday, the Federal Court heard that Mr Newman’s case would go to hearing before Justice Thomas Thawley on Monday, May 10.
Chief Justice James Allsop set the hearing date less than 24 hours after the application was lodged on Wednesday afternoon.
Health Minister Greg Hunt announced the emergency declaration at the heart of the legal battle on Friday, April 30, under the Biosecurity Act.
The ban, introduced as a response to a crippling and deadly wave of coronavirus sweeping India, is set to expire on May 15.

It makes it a crime for people, including citizens and permanent residents, to enter Australia if they have been in India in the past 14 days.
Those who breach the order have been warned they face penalties of up to $66,000 in fines, five years in jail or both.
A government spokesperson has said it is confident “in the sound legal basis of this determination”.
The Morrison government has said the direction is also subject to review and could be lifted early.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on breakfast TV this week the chances of an Australian being jailed for breaching the ban was “pretty much zero”.

The AFL has amended the start times of two round eight matches in response to an outbreak of COVID-19 in Sydney this week.
New South Wales chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said there is a possibility of a missing link between the two locally acquired COVID-19 cases and a US traveller in hotel quarantine who share the same virus strain. “The sequence from our new cases matched with the overseas case who has travelled from the US and went to the Park Royal at Darling Harbour, the person was tested on day one and was positive and was moved to the SHA, the Sydney Health Accommodation, on the 28th [of May],” she said. Dr Chant said NSW Health was “currently reviewing any CCTV footage to look at how transmission occurred” but said there was no direct link they had found. “We can’t find any direct link between our case so what we’re concerned about is there another person that is yet unidentified that passed it onto our case.”

The AFL has altered the start times of two round eight games less than two days before their first bounces,
In response to a recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Sydney, the AFL has moved the starting time of Essendon’s match with GWS from 1.45pm AEST to 2.10pm AEST this Saturday.
The match will remain at Giants Stadium as planned despite speculation it could have been moved to GWS’ interstate home of Canberra.
According to a statement from the AFL, the change will ensure Essendon has enough time to travel to and from NSW by chartered flight on game day.
As a result, the game between St Kilda and Gold Coast has been pushed forward from 2.10pm AEST to 1.45pm AEST.
All other fixtures, including the match between the Sydney Swans and the Melbourne Demons, remain unchanged.
On Thursday, the Swans were granted permission to enter Melbourne for their clash with the Demons after all players and staff members tested negative to coronavirus this week.
The club will charter a flight to Melbourne on Thursday evening and has been told to prepare for a longer stay than normal.
Sydney’s VFL side are remaining behind and will play their match against the Casey Demons at a later date.

“The club will continue to closely monitor the COVID situation and be led by the AFL and NSW government,” the Swans said in a statement on Thursday.
“The safety of everyone in our programs and the wider community remains paramount.”
Earlier on Thursday, Essendon was told its match with GWS could be shifted to Canberra as a result of Sydney’s COVID scare.
Coach Ben Rutten said he and the club wanted to know by Thursday night at the latest despite declaring the experiences of 2020 meant his players could adapt to anything.
On Wednesday, the NSW government confirmed one person in the state had tested positive to COVID-19, forcing a number of hot spots to be declared and players from GWS and Sydney forced to undertake tests ahead of their Round 8 fixtures.
On Thursday morning, Rutten said he and the players were still waiting on confirmation of the impact of any changes.
“We are aware there may be some changes but we are still waiting to see what that looks like,” he said.
“There’s a few different scenarios … we can’t plan for too much. We will wait and see what we are doing.
“Guys are pretty accepting of it now. We knew coming into the year it was going to be a different looking year on the back of last year.
“We need to know by tonight what’s happening. Our plan is to travel up there tomorrow, but that may change.
“We did it (fly in, fly out on game day) a bit last year, that’s not uncommon now.”
GWS players have Thursday off but were briefed about the outbreak on Wednesday.
All players and club staff were told to get tested, with the last of those taking place on Thursday morning.
No Giant was at any of the government-listed exposure sites.
The AFL already moved Fremantle’s clash with Brisbane to the Gabba for this weekend, flipping a game later in the season.
The Dockers will remain on the Gold Coast for the next fortnight, flying to Essendon in Round 9.

A 64-year-old woman from WA is among five more people to have developed blood clots after having the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, it has been revealed.
A 64-year-old woman from WA is among five more people to have developed blood clots after having the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, it was revealed.
Australia’s medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), revealed today that the latest cases of thrombosis are “likely to be linked” to the jab.
The other cases were in a 74-year-old man and 51-year-old woman from Victoria, a 66-year-old man from Queensland and a 70-year-old man from Tasmania.
A WA Health spokesman said the woman, from regional WA, was vaccinated on April 8 and went to a Perth hospital after suffering a small stroke on April 24.
“The potential case was reported on the day of admission and details forwarded to the TGA,” he said.
“The woman was treated and discharged from hospital and is expected to do well.”
The latest cases bring the total number of Australian reports of blood clots and low blood platelets assessed as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following the AstraZeneca vaccine to 11.
The TGA said it was “encouraging” that of the five people who developed blood clots following vaccination in the previous week, four have now been discharged from hospital.
It comes after 48-year-old NSW Genene Norris died last month from a blood clot after having the AstraZeneca vaccine. Her death sparked mass cancellations of bookings for the jab.
Australians aged over 50 can currently only get the AstraZeneca vaccine, and more than 1.4 million doses have been given nationwide to date.
The Federal Government decided to restrict access to the Pfizer jab — the other vaccine currently available in Australia — to the under 50s because of the rate of blood clots in younger people.
Archie Clements, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Curtin University, said that despite these “rare but severe reactions”, AstraZenenca was safe for the vast majority of people.
“To protect our communities, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable, people should take up the offer to be vaccinated,” he said.
“Remember, being vaccinated is not just about protecting your own health, but the health of your loved ones and others in your community and provides the only path out of the current global public health crisis.”
But Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine and public health at Flinders University said the latest cases showed blood clots were a potential issue for older people, not just those under 50, who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“Clearly more data is needed on the exact statistics and risks of this condition – if about 500,000 Australians have received the vaccine in the last few weeks this would indicate a rate as high as 1:100,000 in elderly recipients,” the research director at Vaxine Pty Ltd, which is developing its own COVID-19 vaccine, said.
“But this is the rate previously quoted for those under 50, suggesting that there may in fact be no difference in risk according to age.”
Professor Petrovsky said it raised the question of whether it might be advisable to wait for better vaccines. .
“The last thing we want to see is policies backfiring by increasing vaccine hesitancy in the community, so the government is going to have to tread very carefully on how it handles such issues,” he said.

The head of the TGA Professor John Skerritt has encouraged the Australian public to report “adverse events” in relation to coronavirus vaccines.

It comes following suspected clotting cases in both Queensland and Tasmania.

Speaking on Thursday, Professor Skerritt noted that for every 1,000 doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine administered, the TGA receives “between six and seven – on average - adverse event reports”.

“These are reports, they’re not necessarily cause and effect from the vaccines … and overwhelmingly these reports are of the sorts of things that are associated with any vaccination generally – fever, joint pain, muscle soreness, tiredness, maybe even nausea,” he said.

“We’ve had a total of just over 15,000 adverse event reports and that’s a significant increase over the types and numbers of adverse event reports we’ve had in previous years, but of course in previous years we haven’t had a program of the nature of the COVID vaccine.”

Professor Skerritt said there has been a “deliberate raising of awareness” about COVID-19 vaccines among the public, and subsequently a significant increase in adverse event reports.

“It might sound funny but we’re actually encouraged by the fact, because we want consumers to report adverse events directly to us whether it’s any vaccine or any medicine,” he said.

“We’ve had a sixty-fold increase in the number of adverse event reports made to us by consumers since, compared with say 2020.

“We see that as a good thing, we want to encourage people to step forward and of course we undertake to look at all of them and to dig deeply into the serious and unexpected ones.”

Most COVID-19 restrictions are set to be lifted in Western Australia this weekend but some will stay in place for a while. Here’s what you can and can’t do.
Mother’s Day will be slightly different this year as Sydneysiders are instructed to follow strict new COVID-19 safety measures this weekend.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan says restrictions will ease this weekend. Picture: Matt Jelonek/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images
Most COVID-19 restrictions will be lifted in the Perth and Peel regions this weekend but some will stay in place for at least another week, including the use of masks in certain situations.
Another lockdown was narrowly avoided after a quarantine hotel security guard at the Pan Pacific tested positive for coronavirus and also spread it to two housemates, but tough restrictions were put in place instead.
Western Australia has gone four days without any community transmission and Premier Mark McGowan said that meant some restrictions could ease, as planned, from 12.01am on Saturday.
Mr McGowan said the outcome was “terrific news” and “the exact result we need”, adding all 115 close contacts of the security guard had tested negative for the virus.
“There is no evidence of spread from case 1001 beyond his two household contacts,” the Premier said on Thursday.
“This is pleasing news and helps us to move forward.”
Mr McGowan also revealed Western Australia’s border would remain open for NSW travellers following an outbreak of the virus in that state, but said there would be self-quarantine measures in place.

Under changes to the COVID-19 restrictions in the Perth and Peel regions, masks will still be required on public transport, and at events or venues with more than 1000 people.
They will also be required at hospitals, and at disability and aged care facilities. There will be a limit of four visitors per day.
“This is a significant relaxation on the wearing of masks, which can be done safely and based on health advice,” Mr McGowan said.
“This also means high school students will no longer be required to wear masks.
“Masks will also no longer be required at gyms or other fitness venues, or at work.
“I know how frustrating and annoying it can be to wear masks, so thank you to everyone for doing the right thing during this period.”
From Saturday, people will be able to host 100 visitors at their home.
Nightclubs and the casino will also reopen, subject to the 2 sqm rule.
Major stadium capacity will also return to 75 per cent, but masks will be mandatory.
“The restrictions over the coming week are relatively light touch,” Mr McGowan said.
Restrictions will be further reviewed next week.
Masks will be mandatory for at least another week. Picture: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesSource:Getty Images
The Premier said authorities would continue to closely monitor “the evolving situation” in Sydney after a man and his wife were diagnosed with the virus.
Genomic testing of the man has linked his infection back to a returned traveller with an Indian variant of the virus, but how he came to be infected is still under investigation.
“NSW authorities are continuing to contact trace,” Mr McGowan said.
“At the moment, there is no change in our border controls with NSW.”
However, any arrivals from the listed exposure sites will be ordered to self-quarantine for two weeks, and get tested on day two and 12.
“I’ve been advised that so far, we’ve had no arrivals into Western Australia who’ve been linked to any of the exposure sites,” Mr McGowan said.
“That is welcome but we must remain vigilant. We hope NSW can get on top of this outbreak quickly.
“We wish them all the best and we have offered them our help should they need it.”

Mr McGowan also revealed Perth and Peel small businesses impacted by the Anzac Day weekend lockdown could apply for $2000 grants to assist with some of the costs incurred.
The small business lockdown assistance grants program will be available for about 15,000 businesses at an estimated cost of $31.8 million.
Sectors eligible to apply for a grants include:

Western Australia recorded three new cases of COVID-19 in hotel quarantine overnight — a man and woman both aged in their 30s and a child.
It brings the state’s total number of infections to 1013, including 28 active cases. One of them is in hospital.
There are currently 1819 people in Western Australia’s hotel quarantine system.
Health Minister Roger Cook said more than 90 per cent of all health care staff working in quarantine, more than 80 per cent of hotel workers and upward of 70 per cent of security guards had at least received one dose of the vaccine.

“Just quarantine you if you have been to the venues that the couple have been to.”

The Swans have been permitted to travel interstate for their game against the Demons this weekend despite new cases of community COVID-19 transmission recorded in Sydney.
All Swans players and staff undertook COVID-19 tests on Wednesday and all have returned negative results.
Sydney confirmed three members of its coaching staff – Jarrad McVeigh, Dean Cox and Don Pyke – attended the Azure Cafe in Moore Park between 12.30pm-1pm on Monday, placing them at risk of infection.
The trio have been deemed casual contacts of the COVID-19 case and self-isolated before each returning negative test results.
Other Swans staff members, including senior coach John Longmire, also attended the Azure cafe outside of the 12.30pm-1pm window.
“The club will continue to closely monitor the COVID situation and be led by the AFL and NSW government,” the Swans said in a statement on Thursday afternoon.
“The safety of everyone in our programs and the wider community remains paramount.”
The Swans have the chance to become the first team to defeat the Melbourne Demons when they face the first-placed side at the MCG on Saturday.

Meanwhile, the Swans’ cross-town rivals, the Giants, anxiously await COVID-19 results to determine whether they will be able to host the Bombers at Giants Stadium on Saturday afternoon.
The AFL has not yet revealed whether the game will be rescheduled if a Giants player of staff member returns a positive COVID-19 test.
According to the AFL, no one working at the club attended any of the locations identified as exposure sites by the NSW government.

The NSW premier has called for calm from New Zealand after the state’s two coronavirus cases triggered a pause on the trans-Tasman bubble.
Hundreds of travellers went to Sydney Airport this morning to catch the first flights overseas in 395 days – but they were surprised by what they found there.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has called for calm from New Zealand, labelling Jacinda Ardern’s decision to pause flights as an “overreaction”.
Ms Ardern announced yesterday that New Zealand had put a pause on all flights out of NSW, amid the state reporting two locally acquired cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
On Thursday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian revealed the wife of a man in his 50s, who found out he was infected on Wednesday, tested positive to the virus as well.
In response, Ms Berejiklian announced a slate of new restrictions in Greater Sydney over the next three days to minimise the chances of further cases spreading.
New Zealand health officials wasted no time announcing restrictions against NSW, just weeks after both nations opened the trans-Tasman travel bubble.
“That, to me, is an overreaction,” Ms Berejiklian told Sunrise.
“If that's what the department says they must do, that's what she does. But I certainly think the response should also be proportionate to the risk.
“You can take measures to stop a super spreading event, which is what we have done.
“We have said is if you are indoors, where the virus is more likely to spread as an event, wear a mask.
“If you are indoors at home and have people over for Mother's Day, just make sure you don't have more than 20 in the home because that could spread it to all your loved ones.”
Flights from NSW were suspended from 11.59pm last night for 48 hours.

COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said while Sydney’s new case was not unexpected being a household contact, there were several outstanding unknowns so it was safest to pause flights, but the situation would be under constant review.
“We do acknowledge this has the potential to disrupt people’s travel,” he said.
“This isn’t a decision we take lightly.
“What you will see with cases like this...is before we move to a restriction is we will gather enough information to make an informed decision.
“Everything is based on the information you have at the time. There will always be cases that are right at the margin where you need you to gather more information...we are erring on the side of caution.”
Mr Hipkins said the pause could be extended if further information came to light and officials needed more time.
He said New Zealand had a lot of confidence in NSW’s contract tracing system and that it was one of the strongest in Australia.
“We indicated when we opened up the trans-Tasman travel bubble (that we) will continue to be cautious,we are continuing to be cautious,” he said.
The travel bubble across the ditch launched on April 19, after more than a year of travel bans in place between both countries.
Queensland have also rapidly brought in restrictions against Greater Sydney, in a swift move to keep coronavirus out of its state.
Queensland Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said from 1am Friday, May 7, anyone arriving in the state who had been to any of the venues identified by NSW Health would need to go into hotel quarantine.
“We believe these are sensible restrictions at this time and, of course, we will be watching and monitoring very closely what is happening in New South Wales,” Ms D’Ath said.
Following the announcement, many Queenslanders in Sydney reportedly immediately made plans to return home, even before the announcement was made.
Prime Minister Ardern’s advice to New Zealanders currently in NSW is to be vigilant around health messaging, record your movements and listen to updates and locations of interest.

New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said there is a possibility of a missing link between the two locally acquired COVID-19 cases and a US traveller in hotel quarantine who share the same virus strain. 

“The sequence from our new cases matched with the overseas case who has travelled from the US and went to the Park Royal at Darling Harbour, the person was tested on day one and was positive and was moved to the SHA, the Sydney Health Accommodation, on the 28th [of May],” she said.

Dr Chant said NSW Health was “currently reviewing any CCTV footage to look at how transmission occurred” but said there was no direct link they had found.

“We can’t find any direct link between our case so what we’re concerned about is there another person that is yet unidentified that passed it onto our case.”

Mother’s Day will be slightly different this year as Sydneysiders are instructed to follow strict new COVID-19 safety measures this weekend.

A range of new safety measures will be put back in place across greater Sydney after the state posted another two new locally acquired infections on Thursday.
Residents will be required to adhere to the following public health guidelines from 5pm on Thursday until 12am on Monday:
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the measures would only apply to people in the greater Sydney area – from Central Coast, greater Sydney down to Illawarra.

She said it was “business as usual” for anyone outside those areas.
She urged people to “be sensible” in a bid to control the outbreak currently plaguing Sydney.
“Maintain your good social distancing. Make sure you avoid large events if you’re vulnerable and make sure you exhibit good hand hygiene and most importantly make sure, if you have the mildest of symptoms, you come forward and get tested,” she told reporters on Thursday.
“What is really critical to all of us in New South Wales is to make sure that we’re on alert.”
A reporter then quizzed Ms Berejiklian after she urged people to “avoid large events”, questioning why six scheduled NRL games had not been cancelled in light of the outbreak.
To which the Premier replied: “They’re outdoor events. They should go ahead. Outdoor events are low risk. We’re doing this in relation to indoor gatherings which are higher risk.
“I’m happy for people to criticise me or question what we do. But the strongest message we send is business as usual for businesses. From time to time we’ll ask them to wear a mask.
“We’re in the middle of a pandemic. What happens if tomorrow we find 20 cases? People say we haven’t gone hard enough.”

A Sydney man in his 50s tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday morning, triggering the urgent response from health officials.
It was initially unclear where the man from Sydney’s eastern suburbs might have contracted the virus, with officials saying he hadn’t travelled overseas recently.
But on Thursday authorities said they discovered how he became infected, but worried there was a “missing link” who was also positive.
The news came after the wife of the man tested positive to the virus as well.
The couple were the first two confirmed local cases of coronavirus in NSW in more than a month.
Genome analysis revealed the likely source of the man’s infection was a person who arrived from the US and attended special health accommodation after testing positive upon arrival in Australia.

At least two Westfield shopping centres were part of a growing list of coronavirus exposure sites after contact tracing revealed the infected man’s route through Sydney before his positive result was clear.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard urged people to get tested at the more than 300 COVID-19 testing locations across the state, including new pop up sites in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
“It is also important to remember that even if you have had your first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine you must still come forward for testing if you have any symptoms,” he said.

New South Wales has recorded just one new case of COVID-19 – the wife of the Sydney man who tested positive on Wednesday.

“The balance of his close contact are negative. So whilst, of course, we remain on high alert, pleasingly, at this stage, nobody else has been identified as being a positive case,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. 

“But we know that the incubation period of this virus is 14 days and everybody has to be on high alert moving forward, especially over the next few days.”

NSW health officials have revealed how a Sydney man was infected with COVID as his wife tests positive to the illness as well.

NSW Health officials have said they know who carried the coronavirus that infected a Sydney man but worry there is a “missing link” who is also positive.
The news came after the wife of the eastern suburbs man in his 50s, who found out he was infected on Wednesday, tested positive to the virus as well.
The couple were the first two confirmed local cases of coronavirus in NSW in over a month.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said “health detectives” had managed to trace the source of the man’s infection.
Genome analysis revealed the likely source of the man’s infection was a person who arrived from the US and attended special health accommodation after testing positive upon arrival in Australia.

But it’s still not clear how the virus managed to spread from that person to the eastern suburbs man who was confirmed positive on Wednesday.
“We can’t find any direct link between our (cases),” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“So what we’re concerned about is that there is another person that is yet to be identified that infected our case.”
Dr Chant said the health department believed the virus strain originated in India.
However, it was not currently considered a “variant of concern”, the term the department uses for certain highly transmissible versions of the coronavirus such as those that originated in the UK and South Africa.
The man visited a number of venues in Sydney before he realised he was infected, including a CBD restaurant where NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet was having coffee at the same time.
Mr Perrottet has tested negative for the virus but will remain in self-isolation for 14 days starting last Friday.
The fears of continued community spread prompted Ms Berejiklian to announce a raft of new restrictions for greater Sydney.

Residents will be required to adhere to the following public health guidelines from 5pm on Thursday until midnight on Monday:
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the measures would only apply to people in the greater Sydney area – from the Central Coast, through to Sydney and down to the Illawarra.
“We believe this is a proportionate response to the risk ahead of us,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Virus fragments were discovered in a sewage network that services suburbs in Sydney’s inner west, NSW Health announced on Wednesday night.
The Marrickville Sewage Network handles waste from the suburbs of Marrickville, Dulwich Hill, Summer Hill, Lewisham, Ashfield, Haberfield, Petersham, Lilyfield and Leichhardt, home to some 42,000 people.
“NSW Health is asking everyone in these areas to be especially vigilant in monitoring for symptoms, and if they appear to get tested and isolate immediately until a negative result is received,” the department said.
It wasn’t clear whether there was any link to the infected couple and the fragments detected in the sewage.
There were 11,579 COVID-19 tests reported in NSW in the 24 hour period until 8pm on Wednesday night, about 2,000 fewer than the previous day.
Over 4400 vaccines were administered in the latest 24-hour reporting period, and the total figure for the state is 717,752.
There were nine new cases in hotel quarantine.

The leader of one of the worst-hit countries on the planet has made extraordinary comments suggesting China created COVID-19.
Bolsonaro’s deadly leadership decisions have fuelled the out-of-control coronavirus crisis unfolding in Brazil.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has thrown out the rule book for dealing with China.
The far-right leader, who many have likened to former US president Donald Trump, calls it how he sees it – even if what he sees is, frankly, a bit out there.
On Wednesday, he continued his assault on Beijing with some wild claims about the origins of COVID-19 – a virus which has so far killed more than 400,000 people in Brazil and infected more than 14 million.
He said coronavirus may have been made in a laboratory to wage “biological warfare”.
“It’s a new virus. Nobody knows whether it was born in a laboratory or because a human ate some animal they shouldn’t have,” Mr Bolsonaro said.
“But the military knows all about chemical, biological and radiological warfare. Could we be fighting a new war? I wonder. Which country’s GDP has grown the most?”
He did not name China, but the country where the pandemic began was the only G20 economy to grow last year, notching a 2.3 per cent expansion.

Brazil’s GDP shrank 4.1 per cent and the United States’ GDP fell 3.5 per cent.
Mr Bolsonaro and his inner circle have a history of inflammatory comments on China that have sometimes aggravated relations with Brazil’s biggest trading partner.
In March, the President replaced former foreign minister Ernesto Araujo, who had denounced “Maoist China” and its plan for “world domination” with career diplomat Carlos Franca.
The move was widely seen as aimed at mending ties.
Bolsonaro’s comments not well received
But the theory that COVID-19 emerged in a virology lab in the city of Wuhan is a touchy subject for China which strongly denies the allegation.
A World Health Organisation report concluded in March that it was “extremely unlikely” the virus originated in a lab. However, WHO experts said they had encountered difficulties accessing raw data when they visited Wuhan.
Mr Bolsonaro’s comments were not received well inside Brazil. As CNN reported, Senator Omar Aziz, who is the president of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, said the inflammatory words were likely to complicate things further with China.

“Today was bad, you see, and it calls for chemical warfare and such,” he said.
Experts have written at length about the strained relationship between Brazil and China.
Washington-based think tank the Brookings Institution published an article last year detailing how Mr Bolsonaro’s strategy with China differed from that of previous leaders.
“Brazil is China’s most important economic and political partner in South America, as well as a key participant in the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) grouping of emerging powers that China increasingly leads,” the article reads.
“When it comes to global aspirations, China and Brazil have historically been in sync on their critiques of the liberal international order, if not on their preferred remedies.
“Since President Jair Bolsonaro assumed office in January 2019, this historical pattern has been up-ended. Bolsonaro and his foreign policy team have adopted a strongly pro-US (specifically pro-president Donald Trump) agenda internationally, including engaging in frequent critiques of China.

“Domestically, the partnership with China has been controversial with some sectors. Specifically, the partnership is criticised by the Brazilian manufacturing sector, which faces strong competition from Chinese products and lacks reciprocal access to Chinese market, and by nationalist-populist voters who support Bolsonaro.
“Agricultural export interests, by contrast, favour a strong relationship with Beijing because China is a major market for their products.”
China hits back at Brazil over criticism
The article highlighted how China had hit back at Brazil over its ongoing criticism.
“While initially restrained in response to criticism from the Bolsonaro administration, Chinese diplomats have struck back in 2020 in interviews and op-eds with local media. This confrontational dynamic is a marked departure from the historical trend in Brazil-China relations, which has trended toward deeper economic and political relations.
“China has a long-term interest in a close diplomatic relationship with Brazil, important both for its strategy in Latin America and maximising its global leadership. Beijing is unlikely to want this tension to become the ‘new normal’ in its relations with Brazil.
“In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bolsonaro administration has steered an erratic course between conciliatory rhetoric, seeking Chinese assistance against the novel coronavirus, and further criticism. Despite the preferences of its current foreign policy team, Brazil has important long-term strategic interests in maintaining a working partnership with China.”
China has not responded well to criticism from any country of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Australia’s calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus have led to an all-time low for Australia-China relations.

A coastal town in Japan that received millions in COVID-19 relief money has spent a huge chunk of it on this statue of a giant pink squid.
A coastal town in Japan is trying to drum up tourism by installing a sculpture of a giant pink squid, with money coming from a pandemic relief fund.

A coastal town in Japan has dropped a reported 25 million yen – about $296,000 – on a massive sculpture of a pink squid, using money designated for coronavirus pandemic relief, in a bold bid to boost tourism.
Construction began in October on the giant squid, which is 13m-long, 9m-wide and 4m-high, and has been installed in a prominent position close to the waterfront in Noto, in the Ishikawa prefecture on Japan’s central-western coast.

Officials in Noto claim that their investment in the structure will help drum up tourism in the cash-strapped fishing town, where squid is a local delicacy.
Although Japan is currently battling another spike of COVID-19, declaring a state of emergency just last month, Noto says its case rate has been low throughout the pandemic. Regardless, their tourism industry has taken a big hit.
The peninsula city received a total of 800 million yen ($A9.5 million) in emergency economic relief funds though government grants – money which could be used for anything, not just coronavirus-related efforts.

Nevertheless, some are criticising Noto’s administration for spending so much on the bizarre monument – especially as COVID-19 continues to ravage communities throughout Japan and around the world.
So far there have been nearly 530,000 COVID-19 cases in the country, resulting in the deaths of more than 10,293 people, according to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, out of a total population of 126.3 million.

One of NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s top ministers has been forced to isolate after dining at the same restaurant as a positive COVID case.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

The NSW Treasurer has been forced to self-isolate after learning he is a close contact of a positive COVID-19 case.
Dominic Perrottet returned a negative COVID-19 test but remained in isolation nonetheless, following his government’s guidelines.
Mr Perrottet dined at the same restaurant as a man in his 50s who tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.
They both visited the District Brasserie in Sydney’s CBD on Friday around lunchtime, though they were there separately.
Mr Perrottet told The Daily Telegraph that he was there for a cup of coffee with a friend.
He told the newspaper that he tried to check in using a QR code but realised later the scan hadn’t worked.
“We both scanned the QR code and I believed I’d completed the check-in, though it didn’t register,” he said.

“My friend notified me yesterday evening after seeing the public health advice, and I immediately completed a test and went into isolation. This was before either of us were contacted by NSW Health.”
Mr Perrottet was pictured on Monday alongside NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman and Planning Minister Rob Stokes at a funeral service in Manly.
The memorial for former premier Mike Baird‘s mother Judy was also attended by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Health Minister Brad Hazzard.
The latter two stood together at a press conference on Wednesday and announced the new community case.
The other funeral attendees would not be considered close contacts because unlike the Treasurer, they have not been physically close to an infected person.

The eastern suburbs man who tested positive on Wednesday morning attended several venues since April 30, the believed start date of his infectious period.
The man was at the District Brasserie at 2 Chifley Square between 11am and noon that day.
He also visited other venues across Sydney.
Because the man has no links to overseas travel, quarantine or health work, officials are so far stumped as to how he became infected.
Mr Perrottet, who has been treasurer since 2017, lives in his Epping electorate with his wife and six children.
He will continue to self-isolate for 14 days starting last Friday.

Foreign ministers from the world’s leading economies, including Marise Payne, have gathered in London this week for in person talks for the first time in two years.

COVID has managed to make its mark on the final day as members of the Indian delegate were forced to isolate after two tested positive for the virus. 

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was forced to defend the face to face meeting and said the safety measures put in place negated “any conceivable risk” of COVID-19.

An Aussie politician has been caught up in a COVID-19 scare at an international summit in London, where diplomats took aim at China.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne has been caught up in a COVID-19 scare after two positive cases forced an Indian delegation into self-isolation during an international summit in London.
Ms Payne led an Australian delegation invited as a guest, alongside India, to G7 talks in London, where international leaders took aim at China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
But Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday revealed he had been exposed to possible COVID-19 cases and would not meet with fellow leaders in person.
“As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,” he tweeted.
Mr Jaishankar instead met with Ms Payne via videolink, saying the pair agreed to “further strengthen our many convergences” in the Indo-Pacific.

The summit had been touted as a major resumption of in-person diplomacy more than a year since the pandemic began.
But as India grapples the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak, including more than 400,000 cases on Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced to deny claims hosting the talks was premature.
“It’s very important to try to continue as much business as you as you can as a government,” he said.
“We have a very important relationship with India, with our G7 partners. As I understand it, what’s happened is that the individuals concerned are all, they’re all isolating now.”
Mr Johnson confirmed he would meet with India’s delegation via Zoom.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said measures, including daily testing of diplomats, had been imposed to ensure the summit was safe to proceed.
“Immediately (when) we saw those tests, they were in twice into self-isolation,” he said.
“(The measures) are working very effectively to isolate any conceivable potential risk in this case.”
Ms Payne was present as in-person talks went ahead without the Indian delegation, with diplomats separated by glass panels.

The G7 also took aim at China over abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. Picture: Nicolas Asfouri / AFPSource:AFP
The Group of Seven took aim at China over crackdowns on pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong and Tibet and human rights abuses of the Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.
“We continue to be deeply concerned about human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang … especially the targeting of Uyghurs,” it said in a statement released shortly after the talks
“We strongly support independent and unfettered access to Xinjiang to investigate the situation on the ground.”
Beijing and Canberra have been locked in an escalating trade stoush for more than a year, seemingly prompted by Australia’s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 last April.
China has slapped a range of sanctions on Australian products, but the G7 pledged to resist Beijing’s “coercive” behaviour.
“We will work collectively to foster global economic resilience in the face of arbitrary, coercive economic policies and practices,” it said.
“We urge China to assume and fulfil obligations and responsibilities commensurate with its global economic role.”
The summit also focused on security in the Indo-Pacific, a fraught topic as China takes an increasingly assertive stance in the region.
The UK last week dispatched a massive naval fleet to the Indo-Pacific, while Australian politicians and public servants have raised the prospect of war in the region.
US President Joe Biden has also framed US-China relations as a battle “to win the 21st century”.
After her visit to Europe, Ms Payne will travel to Washington to meet representatives of the Biden administration.

Canada has become the first country to authorise Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for children as young as 12 - with the dose previously only approved for those 16 and older.

According to the country’s health minister, one fifth of all COVID cases in Canada have occurred in children and teenagers. 

America’s drug regulator is also poised to authorise the vaccine for those aged 12 to 15 by next week.

White House Infectious Diseases Expert Dr Anthony Fauci says the United States never gave serious consideration to stopping Americans coming back home from India as the country battles a severe second wave of COVID-19. 

“It’s very difficult to do that according to our own laws and our own tradition to ever prevent American citizens from coming back into the country so I don’t think that was ever a consideration,” he told Sky News. 

 “You’re obligated to receive your own citizens back into the country so we never really seriously discussed a complete block of all people coming from India.

“It sounds like the Australians are very, very serious about not letting people into the country who might be risks in the sense of spreading infection.” 

Dr Fauci was reluctant to criticise Australia’s ban on flights from India and the harsh penalties that face rule breakers, saying “I don’t want to try and outguess the Australian authorities”. 

“If I were there, living there, observing on a daily basis what went on, I would be sure more than happy to discuss it with you but I just don’t want to come in from the outside and be critical of the Australian authorities.”

A restaurant in Sydney’s CBD is the latest venue to be added to the COVID exposure list, alongside a second Westfield, after another NSW case.
The New South Wales government is bracing for additional cases of community transmission after a Sydney man in his 50s – who tested positive to COVID-19 on Wednesday – visited several locations while highly infectious. The man was reportedly very active around Sydney’s Eastern suburbs with several sites now on high alert. Three new venues were added to list of potential exposure sites overnight including a Woolworths and Chemist Warehouse in Double Bay and the Royal Sydney Golf Club in Rose Bay. The man had 20 close contacts – with his family now undergoing testing. Announcing the infection yesterday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said “this is very early and no doubt I’ll expect other cases, if we have one case and we don’t have an immediate source, if there’s no direct connection we can establish we have to assume there are other cases.” Testing numbers are expected to rise after 13,500 people came forward for testing yesterday, as testing clinics across the Eastern suburbs extending their operating hours.

A restaurant in Sydney’s city centre is the latest venue to be added to the state’s COVID hot spot list.
Anyone who was at XOPP in Haymarket, on the mezzanine level, between 1.30pm and 2.30pm on April 28 has been urged to get tested.
The alert comes after news broke the wife of the new case also tested positive to COVID-19.
Earlier a second Sydney Westfield was added to the venue exposure list.
Fratelli Fresh, in Westfield Sydney on Pitt Street was added on Thursday morning, with anyone who attended on April 27 between 1.15pm and 2.15pm advised to get a test immediately and isolate until further advice is given.
The same advice was also issued to patrons of Bondi Trattoria on Thursday April 29 from 12:45pm to 1:30pm.

A man in his 50s from Sydney’s eastern suburbs tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, and contact tracing alerts from the case now cover 14 suburbs across the city.
Genome sequencing has linked the man’s case to a returned traveller from the US, who had an Indian variant of the virus, but it is not yet known how the virus spread between them.
On Thursday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the man’s wife had also tested positive to the virus.

“This person did everything right, but it goes to show that we can't take a single thing for granted,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Wednesday.
“It goes to show we have to maintain our social distancing, have to make sure we have good hand hygiene, we need to get tested with the mildest of symptoms, and very importantly and significantly, we need to use QR codes.”

White House Infectious Diseases Expert Dr Anthony Fauci says it is too early to call Australia’s vaccine rollout a failure but urged domestic health authorities to work on getting a “good flow into the arms of people.” 

More than 145 million Americans have received the COVID-19 jab while Australia has administered just 2.4 million vaccines since the rollout began.  

Speaking exclusively to Sky News, Dr Fauci said when the United States began its vaccine rollout in December “we did not have a comprehensive plan of getting it into the community level”. 

“Once you get a good plan going, you’ll see that the rate of daily vaccinations will go up. 

“It’s probably too early to say it’s a failure or not, I think it obviously needs to have some course corrections but I would give them the opportunity to do that before I would call it a failure.” 

Probed on whether it would have been wise to secure more vaccine doses from a wider range of suppliers, Dr Fauci said it was something he was often asked. 

“It’s sort of like what we call in the United States, Monday morning quarterbacking … you could have or should have, when things aren’t working as well as you’d like, you could always out guess yourself and say ‘should we have had more irons in the fire?'” he said. 

“In the United States we did take that step and that’s the reason why we partnered with six separate companies for three separate platforms; the mRNA, the adenovirus and the soluble proteins. 

“And we did that because we felt we wanted to make sure we had good backup in case anything went wrong.”

Coronavirus fragments have been found in a sewage network that services a big part of Sydney’s inner west, just hours after NSW’s new case.
Sewage could be the key to fighting coronavirus, with scientists using wastewater monitoring to keep track of how the virus is spreading.

Tens of thousands of people in Sydney’s inner west have been told to monitor for COVID-19 symptoms after coronavirus fragments were found in the wastewater.
NSW Health said trace amounts of the virus that causes COVID-19 had been found in the Marrickville Sewage Network.
The catchment handles sewage from the suburbs of Marrickville, Dulwich Hill, Summer Hill, Lewisham, Ashfield, Haberfield, Petersham, Lilyfield and Leichhardt, home to some 42,000 people.
The alert came after an eastern suburbs man in his 50s tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday morning, although it wasn’t clear if the positive case and the wastewater fragments were related.
“NSW Health is asking everyone in these areas to be especially vigilant in monitoring for symptoms, and if they appear to get tested and isolate immediately until a negative result is received,” the department said.

“NSW Health is providing a new COVID-19 pop-up testing clinic and extended hours at existing clinics, including drive-throughs, to support increased testing in Sydney’s east and inner city.”
A new pop-up clinic had also been established at Albion Street Centre Laverty Pathology in Surry Hills.
The eastern suburbs man’s positive test result has sparked frantic efforts to figure out how he was infected.
He has no links to hotel quarantine, border control or health work, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Wednesday.
A genome sequencing analysis was expected to give further clues as to where the man was infected. Results were expected on Thursday afternoon.
“All of the usual routes where we would expect someone to have acquired the infection are not clear,” Dr Chant said.
“And that's why this is really – requires us to do that genome sequencing to give us that understanding of where that source of infection was, and then we can work backwards from that.”
She said the man had an especially high viral load which means he could be more infectious than other COVID-19 cases.
It was believed the man has been infectious since April 30.
It was the first case of community spread in NSW since April 1.

The US has announced its support for a global waiver on patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines in a major policy reversal.
United States President Joe Biden has unveiled plans to make it easier for Americans to access coronavirus vaccines. The ‘use it or lose it’ strategy will mean doses unused by states will go into a federal pool to be redistributed nationally. More than 105 million Americans are fully vaccinated with the nation averaging approximately two million inoculations each day. The White House has set the goal of administering at least one dose of the vaccine to 70 per cent of the population by July 4.

The Biden administration has announced support for waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines.
The move was in a response to the “extraordinary circumstances” of the COVID-19 pandemic, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement.
“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines.
“We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) needed to make that happen.
“These negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.”

Developed countries are quickly vaccinating their citizens while poorer nations are being left behind – which critics blame in part on patent protections. Picture: AFPSource:AFP
This is a monumental moment in the fight against #COVID19. The commitment by @POTUS Joe Biden & @USTradeRep@AmbassadorTai to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of 🇺🇸 leadership to address global health challenges. pic.twitter.com/3iBt3jfdEr
RELATED: ‘Madness’: Wild new vaccine theory
The US has come under increasing pressure from countries like India and South Africa to support waivers. Pharmaceutical companies eyeing big profits have lobbied hard to keep them in place.
“The Administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,” Ms Tai said in her statement.
“As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts — working with the private sector and all possible partners — to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.
“It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines.”
The global rollout of the vaccine has been lopsided.
In January more people had been immunised in Israel — with its population of less than 10 million — than in Africa and Latin America combined.
THIS MATTER IS CRITICAL
The WTO has for months been facing calls to temporarily remove the intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines.
Proponents say that would help boost production in developing countries that so far have received far fewer jabs.
But that notion has been met with fierce opposition from pharmaceutical giants and their host countries, which insist the patents are not the main roadblocks to scaling up production, and warn the move could hamper innovation.
WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the way the issue was handled was “critical”.
“We need to have a sense of urgency on how we approach this issue of response to COVID-19 because the world is watching,” she said, describing equitable access to the tools to fight the pandemic as the “moral and economic issue of our time”.

Police said 70 lives were saved when officers in Delhi towed a broken-down truck carting medical oxygen to a hospital on May 3. Police said the truck was headed for Sonia Hospital Nangloi when it broke down. Hospitals across the country are struggling to meet the demand for oxygen from COVID-19 patients. Footage released on Twitter shows officers attaching their white police van to the truck. Rather than wait for the towing crane, officers took it upon themselves to tow the truck 3.5 km (2.2 mi) to the hospital, likely saving the lives of 70 coronavirus patients, Delhi Police wrote. On May 5, India reported 382,315 new cases of coronavirus and 226,188 total deaths. Credit: Delhi Police via Storyful

Apparently it is unconstitutional for the government to close the borders in relation to COVID-19, but “according to the High Court it is constitutional” for WA to close its border for basically a year, says Sky News host Paul Murray.

His comments come amid news an Australian man stuck in India is challenging the validity of the federal government’s decision to make it a crime for citizens to travel home from India.

“Think about the legal standards here,” Mr Murray said.

“That’s the nutty world we’re in right now.”

The AFL fixture could yet again be thrown into chaos after the latest COVID-19 case in New South Wales was deemed “highly contageous’.
NSW Health has expressed grave concerns about the recent case of community transmission as the man in his 50s has a high viral load making him potentially extremely infectious.

The AFL fixture could yet again be thrown into chaos after the latest COVID-19 case in New South Wales.
The NSW government confirmed one person in the state had tested positive, forcing a number of hot spots to be declared.
On Wednesday, NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said she expected more cases to be confirmed given the man had been very active in the state.

GWS and Sydney players have been forced to undertake COVID-19 tests ahead of their Round 8 fixtures.
The Giants host Essendon on Saturday, with current Victorian guidelines allowing travel to the state, with only the specific hot spot areas currently regarded as red zones under Victoria’s traffic light system.
Sydney heads to the MCG to face the in-form Demons on Saturday night.
“My understanding is highly contagious. On a scale of one to 10, it’s a 10,” Eddie McGuire said on Channel 9’s Footy Classified.
“The AFL is now on red alert to changes on this round. Sydney is set to travel to Melbourne 24 hours early
“Geelong have extensive tests to make sure players are clearly.”

McGuire also explained there were three possible scenarios for the GWS versus Essendon game.
“Game remains in Sydney, go up in a bubble, play and get out,” McGuire said.
“If things pick up, there are contingency plans for this game to be moved to Canberra. If things get bad, the game will need to come to Melbourne and things will need to be flipped.
“It looks like Sydney could come down and may stay.”
Former St Kilda and Fremantle coach Ross Lyon declared it was “gut-wrenching” that COVID-19 outbreaks were continuing.
“It’s gut-wrenching that it has reared its head. It puts a lot of pressure on the whole competition and community, it’s really concerning,” he said.
The AFL already moved Fremantle’s clash with Brisbane to the Gabba for this weekend, flipping a game later in the season.
The Dockers will remain on the Gold Coast for the next fortnight, flying to Essendon in Round 9.

Two positive COVID-19 cases have been identified at a G7 meeting of world leaders in London attended by Foreign Minister Marise Payne.
India’s delegation is now self-isolating and its foreign minister said he would attend the meeting virtually after he was exposed to possible coronavirus cases.
India is not part of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies but was invited by Britain to the talks in London.
“Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases,” India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar tweeted on Wednesday.
“As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well.”

Sky News earlier reported there had been two positive cases among the Indian delegation.
Mr Jaishankar met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in-person on Monday evening on the sidelines of the foreign ministers summit.
The US State Department said it had been advised, including by public health professionals in Britain, that its health protocols “would permit us to continue with our G7 activities as planned”.
“We have no reason to believe any of our delegation is at risk. We will continue to follow the guidance of public health professionals going forward and abide by the same strict COVID-19 protocols,” spokesman Ned Price said.

RELATED: Devastating plight facing hot zones
India, the world’s second-most populous nation, has been hit by a devastating wave of infections in recent weeks that has taken its total number of cases to more than 20.6 million.
The massive spike has pushed the healthcare system to breaking point, overwhelming hospitals and leading to severe shortages of beds, oxygen and other critical medical supplies.
The G7 was due to discuss coronavirus vaccines Wednesday amid growing pressure on the group to share stockpiles and know-how with poor nations.
G7 talks vaccines after pleas to help poor
Foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States are wrapping up three days of talks in central London that will set the agenda for a G7 leaders’ summit next month in Cornwall, southern England.
After a day focused on showing a common front of democracies towards China, the final sessions will also bring in development chiefs and address global challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.

“A really valuable part of the G7 format is to think in the round — what do we need to do to help the most vulnerable countries around the world?” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told reporters.
Wealthy nations have put an emphasis on Covax, a UN-backed program meant to share vaccines with the poorest nations.
But rich nations have also effectively elbowed out Covax in the early stages, striking their own deals with drug manufacturers and taking the overwhelming share of the more than 1.2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine that have already been injected worldwide.
Mr Raab stressed the importance of Covax but said there was an additional question of “what we do about surplus domestic supply”.
The issues are “a really good opportunity for the G7 together with our Indo-Pacific partners to talk all of that through and come up with positive answers”, Mr Raab said.
Britain invited India to the G7 talks, seeking to include a democratic ally crucial to discussions on China.

Just hours after NSW health officials revealed a shock new local case of COVID-19, other states were quick to respond.
Sky News host Chris Kenny says the single new community case of COVID-19 in New South Wales “should not be such big news”. Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday had a snap press conference to announce the case. “The paranoia is running deep,” Mr Kenny said. “Berejiklian had a better take on all of this stuff recently back in April when she said each infection should not be big news. “We need to tone this down … stop being alarmist, stop scaring people, stop making a disaster out of every single infection of a disease that is mild or even asymptomatic for 99 per cent of Australians who get it.”

Health authorities in several jurisdictions have issued advice for residents in response to the shocking news that NSW had recorded a new locally-acquired case of COVID-19.
Advice from the Queensland health department states that anyone who has visited any Sydney hotspot venues at the listed exposure times must quarantine at their home, contact the department and get tested as soon as possible.
Queensland's chief health officer Jeannette Young said it was essential people who may have been exposed to the virus stay home.

“NSW Health has already made it clear that anyone who has been to any of those venues should be quarantining and not getting on flights,” Dr Young said.
“We’re working closely with NSW to get a better understanding of the risk associated with this case, so as an interim measure, we’re mirroring NSW Health’s advice.”
She said the department would continue to assess the situation and urged residents to monitor the government website for updates.
The Victorian government also issued advice, declaring all of NSW would remain a ‘green zone’ until more about the new infection was known “including genomic sequencing results”.
That means anyone from anywhere in NSW can travel freely to Victoria but should still apply for a travel permit.
But anyone who is in Victoria and attended an infected venue will be classified as a ‘tier 1’ and must get tested and isolate for the full 14 days.

“Using travel permit data, the department will today message people who have entered VIC from NSW since 30 April,” the Victorian Department of Health said on Twitter.
“Flight manifests have been requested from the National Incident Room. Authorised Officer presence and spot checking will be increased for flights from Sydney.”
SA Health had similar advice, saying anyone who was at a hot spot venue must get tested and isolate.
The man who tested positive is in his 50s and lives in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
He returned a positive result on Wednesday, sparking several venue alerts.

NSW Health is now racing to work out how the man caught the disease given he has no links to hotel quarantine, border control or health.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said urgent genomic sequencing was underway.
“All of the usual routes where we would expect someone to have acquired the infection are not clear,” Dr Chant said.
“And that’s why this ... requires us to do that genome sequencing to give us that understanding of where that source of infection was, and then we can work backwards from that.”

Workplace Editor at The Australian Ewin Hannan says "one of the most concerning things" about secret reports into Victoria's hotel quarantine management is "the lack of transparency". 

"We're told a version of events when things happen... they do investigations, but these investigations never come to light," he said.

"The story all along has been the man with the nebuliser; family of three; he was the cause of the virus leaving the Holiday Inn. 

"In fact, this report... says the actual virus escaped initially from down the corridor from a woman who caught COVID-19 in Sri Lanka."

A leading epidemiologist has debunked a myth about how a Sydney man caught COVID-19 as the case continues to baffle authorities.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she cannot rule out any increase in restrictions and expects more cases will emerge after a man in his 50s tested positive for COVID-19. The premier announced a new case of community transmission on Wednesday and cautioned that the infected man was “very active in the inner east”. NSW Health does not know the origins of the case, and the premier warned he could have been exposed to people from interstate. Ms Berejiklian said she “no doubt” expected there to be other cases which emerged, and expected the new case will encourage a flurry of new tests. “No doubt this positive case will alert more people to come forward and get tested and that's a good thing,” she said. “All options are on the table, it's way too early. It also means unfortunately we can't rule anything out. “Everybody in the state needs to be on high alert.”

A man who tested positive to coronavirus visited a store located below a Sydney quarantine hotel, but a leading epidemiologist said it was “unlikely” he caught the virus there.
Deakin University’s chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said health officials believed the man was already infectious when he visited the HineSight Optometrist below the Sofitel Wentworth.
“That is unlikely to be the source for him, but equally, all these sites, if they are places he may have been before he became infected, that is something they will be looking at,” she told Sunrise on Thursday morning.
Dr Bennett said given the optometrist and hotel had separate entrances, the man had a “very low” risk of contracting the virus there.
The man in his 50s, from the city’s eastern suburbs, returned a positive result on Wednesday sparking several venue alerts.
Among those was the optometrist located below the Sofitel Wentworth in Sydney’s CBD, which is being used as a quarantine hotel.

The man visited the HineSight Optometrist on April 30 between noon and 1pm. Anyone, even if they have been vaccinated, who was at the venue is urged to isolate until they return a negative result.
The optometrist is not inside the hotel, and has a separate street-facing entrance, but is part of the same building.
He also visited several stores while on the hunt for a barbecue as well as eateries across the city.
“A lot of these are more casual sites, but there are some like a cinema complex where you are sitting in an enclosed place with people for longer,” Dr Bennett said.
She applauded the man for using QR codes but was concerned many other people didn’t.
“It is important that people think back to where they were because he (the infected man) had quite a high viral load when he was tested, and so that day, and possibly a day before that, he might have been quite infectious,” she explained.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said authorities were still trying to find the missing link. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Christian GillesSource:News Corp Australia
Earlier, it was revealed the man was not employed in hotel quarantine or border control, was not a frontline worker and had not been overseas recently, sparking fears the virus may be lingering in the community.
Genome analysis revealed on Thursday that the likely source of the man’s infection was a person who arrived from the US and attended special health accommodation after testing positive upon arrival in Australia.
But it’s still not clear how the virus managed to spread from that person to the eastern suburbs man who was confirmed positive on Wednesday.
“We can’t find any direct link between our (cases),” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“So what we’re concerned about is that there is another person that is yet to be identified that infected our case.”

NSW Health has expressed grave concerns about the recent case of community transmission as the man in his 50s has a high viral load making him potentially extremely infectious.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Wednesday, health authorities discovered a case of COVID-19 in a man in his 50s who had been “very active” in Sydney’s inner east.

Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant expressed concerns around the origins of the case as the man had not travelled overseas, nor worked in border security or hotel quarantine.

She also said the man has a high viral load and could be potentially very infectious, but genomic sequencing and testing of close contacts would be needed to confirm his strain and infectiousness.

“So the CT values in this case were low, so just to be clear low CT values mean that you have a higher viral load and therefore potentially are more infectious, so they do give us some cause for concern,” she said.

“The next ring of testing around this case will actually tell us whether he's passed it on but also in this case we're really interested in how this person acquired the infection to understand the broader risk in the community.”

The Australian government will send its first shipment of medical supplies to India for humanitarian aid as the nation suffers through a catastrophic wave of COVID-19.

India recorded 382,000 cases of COVID-19 yesterday including more than 3700 deaths, as concerns continue about the nation’s hospital capacity and supplies.

Health Minister Greg Hunt announced the Morrison government would send a shipment of medical supplies to India within the next 24 hours.

The shipment will include 1056 ventilators and 42 oxygen compressors.

“This is the first shipment, it is not the last,” Mr Hunt said.

Health Minister Greg Hunt today announced the federal government will next week boost the number of COVID-19 vaccines delivered to GPs across Australia as more doses become available. 

 The number of doses delivered to lower-volume GPs will be tripled from 50 to 150 per week, with the number of doses allocated to medium-volume GPs set to be doubled from 100 to 200 per week. 

“We always said that as supplies became available and as we had confidence in those supplies and sufficient contingency then we would make that available and that’s exactly what we have done,” he said. 

The health minister also addressed the new community case detected in NSW today, stressing contact tracing was underway. 

“We know the strength of the NSW system, the absolute global gold standard,” Mr Hunt said.

Certain general practices will have their allocated vaccine shipments doubled or tripled as the government moves to fix its stalled rollout program.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

Certain general practices will receive a big boost in COVID-19 vaccination doses, Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced, as the federal government moves to accelerate its stalled rollout program.
Mr Hunt said on Wednesday the amount of doses supplied to lower volume general practices would be tripled, while medium volume surgeries would get double the current amount.
“That will give them more capacity as we move into the over 50s phase,” he told reporters.
“It will ensure that we have supplies around the country as we see more and more over 50s coming in.
“This announcement will go a long way to ensuring more Australians are going to be protected.”
Even though many people in the most vulnerable categories have not yet been vaccinated, the next phase - 2a - begins on May 17.

Dr Lucas de Toca, first assistant secretary for the Department of Health’s COVID-19 Primary Care Response, said the “absolute priority” remained people in phase 1 but any additional available doses would be made available for people aged 50 and over.
Mr Hunt said almost 2.4 million vaccinations had been administered nationally under the rollout, including more than 79,000 in the past 24 hours.
Asked when the rollout would hit the pace flagged earlier this year, the minister declined to provide a target but said the number of AstraZeneca doses being delivered would rise from 330,000 this week to 450,000 next week to more than 600,000 the following week.
“Then, of course, in week 17 we are moving to second doses and so at that point, of course, we will be doing first and second doses, and Pfizer, so all of those elements come together,” Mr Hunt said.
The announcement comes as NSW scrambles to find the source of infection for one new locally acquired COVID-19 case - a man in his 50s who has not been overseas or worked in a high-risk job such as the hotel quarantine system.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the man was “very active” in Sydney’s east and so far, warnings have been issued for eight venues he visited between April 30 and May 2 as contact tracers work frantically.
Mr Hunt said the case would appear in Thursday’s figures and there were zero new cases of community spread recorded around the nation on Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison defended Australia’s controversial ban on travel from COVID-ravaged India until May 15, saying it was “a necessary step” that was working because the number of cases in quarantine facilities like Howard Springs in the Northern Territory were coming down.
Mr Hunt said more than one in eight passengers on the most recent flights from India had tested positive.
“That’s a level beyond anything that we had seen before,” he said.
“Our job is to protect Australia against a third wave, our job is to protect our health system.”
Mr Hunt said the ban was a difficult but temporary measure.
The federal government is back-pedalling on its even more contentious threat to jail or fine anyone who returns to Australia within 14 days of being in India, with Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack saying no-one will be imprisoned.
Mr Hunt also announced the first shipment of Australian medical supplies to help India, including 1056 ventilators and 42 oxygen compressors, would soon arrive.

Pat Cummins is stranded in India because of Australia’s border closure as our star cricketers consider fleeing to an island paradise.

Pat Cummins says he was shocked by Scott Morrison’s decision to ban Australians flying home from India as it emerged our cricketers may need to flee elsewhere to escape the worsening COVID-19 situation in India.
The Indian Premier League was suspended on Tuesday night after multiple players — Varun Chakaravarthy, Sandeep Warrier Wriddhiman Saha and Amit Mishra — tested positive. Coaching staff and television crew have also contracted coronavirus as the integrity of the tournament’s biosecure bubble was compromised.

Cummins — the golden boy of Australian cricket and potential captain-in-waiting — is one of many players and coaches who face an anxious wait to get home.
Asked if he was “shocked” by the Australian government’s recent announcement to ban all flights to and from India until at least May 15 — and introduce the threat of jail time for anyone who breached that order — Cummins said it certainly took him by surprise.
“Yeah it did a little bit,” Cummins told The Back Page. “Once we flew out of Australia we knew we were signing up for 14 days quarantine coming home, so you always feel that little bit further away from getting home.
“As soon as the hard border shut, obviously no one has experienced that before. It added a bit of anxiety for a few of the Aussies over here.
“But we signed up to play the tournament until the start of June. Hopefully it all reopens on May 15 and we’ll be able to get back.”
Other big names including David Warner, Steve Smith, Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell are trapped in India, and so too are coaches Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich.
Warner’s daughter Ivy posted a heart-wrenching note to her dad on social media, asking him to come home safely, while former Test opening batsman Michael Slater this week lashed out at Morrison, accusing him of having “blood on your hands” and abandoning Australians.
Slater, who was commentating on the IPL, has fled to the Maldives, and his countrymen may follow suit. Cricinfo reports Australia’s IPL contingent may look to use the island paradise in the Indian Ocean as a temporary base to get out of India and wait for the hard border closure to end.

India is recording about 360,000 cases and 3500 deaths a day and has been hit by chronic shortages of hospital beds and oxygen.
IPL participants are isolating and for now, Cummins is playing the waiting game.
“Think we are all hoping we can get home like we would normally plan and the borders open on May 15, whether it’s (a) private (flight) or not we wouldn’t be allowed back in (yet),” he said.
“Cricket Australia have been brilliant along with the ACA, they are working closely with the government to get the latest information, if we can’t get home it won’t be for lack of trying from all those involved.”
Chris Lynn came under fire last week for suggesting Cricket Australia could help organise a charter flight to get home — although he stressed he in no way wanted cricketers to jump the queue.
CA and the Australian Cricketers Association released a joint statement on Tuesday night saying they are working on plans to get people home safely, but will “not seek exemptions”.
“Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association understand the decision of the BCCI to indefinitely postpone the 2021 Indian Premier League for the safety and wellbeing of all participants,” the statement said.
“CA is in direct contact with the BCCI as they work through plans to ensure the safe accommodation and repatriation of Australian players, coaches, match officials and commentators back home to Australia.
“CA and the ACA respect the decision of the Australian Government to pause travel from India until at least May 15 and will not seek exemptions. CA and the ACA thank the BCCI for their efforts and co-operation for the safe repatriation of all participants at the IPL.”

A Victorian quarantine manager will be stood down from his role pending a review into his conduct after he made headlines this morning for blatantly breaching infection protocols.

Confidential documents unveiled by The Australian revealed a senior bureaucrat in Victoria’s government, who was responsible for managing COVID-19 quarantine, breached protocols on two separate occasions.

General Manager Matiu Bush first breached protocols on April 20 when he went to exit the InterContinental hotel and refused to receive the mandatory quarantine test.

According to the report, when asked by health officials to take the test Mr Bush responded, “I’m the head of IPC and I override that protocol’ or words to that effect”.

Victoria Hotel Quarantine Minister Danny Pearson said he concluded overnight it would be appropriate to stand Mr Bush down pending a review into his conduct. 

“The issue I think with Mr Bush goes more to an issue around his attitude and behaviour,” he said. 

However, Victorian Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said “this person should have gone. Not once but twice they’ve broken their own rules. The rules they are supposed to be supporting.”

Multiple new venues have been added to a growing list of places across Sydney - including a Westfield - visited by a man infected with COVID-19.
The Berejiklian government will launch a new vaccine manufacturing and research industry in a bid to invest in the next generation of vaccines. The Premier announced on Tuesday she had assembled a team of scientists looking to get the industry, focused on mRNA vaccines, up and running in 12-24 months. “This is an opportunity for us to lead the way as far as Australia’s concerned in manufacturing, not just a vaccine that’ll deal with COVID, but vaccines and other cures for illnesses,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. The NSW government is hoping private sector will help bolster the new industry, but little detail is known around financing. “We already have pockets of excellence but what we need to do is bring it all together.”

In a statement, NSW Health said the man was tested on Tuesday and returned a positive result on Wednesday.
“Genome sequencing is underway, with results expected in the next 24 hours,” it said.
“Close contacts are being urgently contacted, tested and isolating. The man visited a number of venues while potentially infectious.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the case was a “wake up call” that the fight against COVID-19 was still not over.
“I want to stress that health is undertaking genomic testing in relation to strains that exist in our quarantine system, but also the strains that exist in the other states as he may have undertaken some travel duration that time or been exposed to people in other states,” she said.
“We can never be complacent,” she said.
“I can try and do the elbow tap but I know around NSW people are shaking hands and kissing in public. We need to be aware that virus is still around.”

NSW has recorded its first COVID-19 case in 34 days as health officials scramble to find out how the man was infected with the virus.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

A Sydney man in his 50s has tested positive for COVID-19 and health officials now fear the coronavirus may have spread in the community.
The man, from Sydney’s eastern suburbs, tested positive on Wednesday morning.
It was unclear where the man might have been infected and officials said he hadn’t travelled overseas recently.
He also does not work in hotel quarantine, border control or health.
“Our job now is to get on top of it to identify any other potential cases, try to identify the source, and make sure we get on top of this case,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

She pleaded with the public to get tested if they feel any symptoms that could be COVID-19.
“The more people that come forward and get tested the more quickly we get on top of this current outbreak,” Ms Berejiklian said.
A genome sequencing analysis was expected to give further clues as to where the man was infected, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said shortly after 1pm.
Results were expected within 24 hours.
“All of the usual routes where we would expect someone to have acquired the infection are not clear,” Dr Chant said.
“And that's why this is really – requires us to do that genome sequencing to give us that understanding of where that source of infection was, and then we can work backwards from that.”

She said the man had an especially high viral load which means he could be more infectious than other COVID-19 cases.
Dr Chant read out a long list of venues visited by the man while potentially infectious.
They included a Bondi Junction movie theatre, Event Cinemas, where the man saw the movie The Courier on Friday, April 30 between 6pm and 8pm.
Anyone who had been to one of the venues at the same time as the man was asked to immediately get tested and self-isolate until receiving further instructions from NSW Health.
That included those who have been vaccinated.
Health officials are urgently trying to get in touch with close contacts of the man, and those that have been contacted have been tested and are isolating.
It was believed the man has been infectious since April 30.
It was the first case of community spread in NSW since April 1.

Authorities have revealed how they believe a quarantine hotel security guard contracted COVID-19 before infecting two of his housemates.
Cricket legend Michael Hussey has become the first Australian in the IPL bubble to test positive for coronavirus.

A security guard at a quarantine hotel in Perth may have contracted COVID-19 after handling the luggage of two infected travellers.
The Perth and Peel region narrowly avoided another lockdown after the security guard at the Pan Pacific Hotel infected two of his housemates, but the community has been forced to wear masks and other restrictions have also been imposed.
Health authorities previously said they believed a traveller from the United States infected a person coming from Indonesia while they shared a flight into Perth, then one of them infected the guard.
Premier Mark McGowan revealed on Wednesday that CCTV footage showed the guard was wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when he handled luggage inside a lift.

“He entered the lift that they had been in, we know that, and he handled some luggage – that’s what the CCTV has showed us,” Mr McGowan said.
“He was masked up, he was wearing all the appropriate gear.
“He handled their luggage, but was there transmission there? We can only speculate.”
Authorities have identified 108 close contacts, of which 75 have tested negative so far.
A further 476 casual contacts have been identified, of which 221 have so far tested negative.

Mr McGowan also gave an update on the man in Collie who returned a “weak positive result” for coronavirus.
The man, aged in his 30s, recently returned to Collie after travelling to Australia from Poland and quarantining in Melbourne for two weeks.
“The very, very strong medical advice is this is an historic case,” Mr McGowan said.
“This person is doing what is called shedding of the virus, which sometimes means that a positive test is picked up even though the person is not infectious.
“I just urge everyone in Collie not to worry, not to panic. We’ll get information out as soon as we possibly can.”
Shortly after Mr McGowan’s press conference, the Health Department issued a statement confirming it was an historical case.
“The man in his 30s poses no threat to community health and has not been included as a positive case in WA statistics,” the department said.
“As a precaution, the man’s three closest contacts were asked to isolate pending further test results, including antibody tests.
“All have been advised of the result and are no longer required to self-isolate.”
A decision about lifting restrictions is expected on Thursday. Picture: NCA NewsWire /Philip GostelowSource:Supplied
Western Australia did not record any local cases overnight, but two new infections were noted in hotel quarantine — two young children who returned from overseas with their parents.
It brings the state’s total number of infections to 1010, including 26 active cases.
Perth currently has 1895 people in hotel quarantine.
“The number is tracking down very slowly, but tracking down because of our reduction in the cap,” Mr McGowan said.
An announcement on lifting restrictions is expected to be made on Thursday.

NSW has recorded a worrying, sharp increase in COVID-19 cases among returned travellers in hotel quarantine overnight.

New South Wales has registered double-digit numbers of COVID-19 cases in hotel quarantine for the second time in five days while the state recorded one case locally.
Overnight, 10 new cases were acquired in overseas travellers.
The locally acquired case, a Sydney man in his 50s from southeastern Sydney, tested positive on Wednesday morning – the first case in NSW in more than a month.
The number of overseas cases ranged between three and seven during the past four days, after flights from India were halted due to growing strain being put on the quarantine system towards the end of April.
NSW recorded 12 cases on April 27, then nine, 15 and 13 cases in the days after.

The federal government on Monday suspended flights from India until mid-May.
The ban on travellers from India was based on health advice from Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly, who said the proportion of COVID-19 positive cases in people arriving from the nation had sharply increased to more than 50 per cent since mid-April.
All passenger flights from India to Australia were grounded on Monday as the country continued to grapple with the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak.
India has averaged more than 300,000 new daily COVID-19 cases over the last 12 days, putting severe pressure on hospitals and oxygen supplies.
Travellers to Australia who defy the ban face fines of more than $60,000, a five-year jail term or both.
“Our advice was we need to do something about the number of these cases coming into our hotel quarantine because of the risk of incursions,” Dr Kelly said.
“The biggest risk coming from – by far and away that was coming from people arriving from India. So, that was the advice given, the public health advice. And then the response to that was obviously a decision of Government to use the Biosecurity Act in that way.”
Since December 11, 1555 cases have been detected in Australian hotel quarantine.
Travellers from India have recorded a large contribution to that total, with 324 cases in total. In April alone, there were 210 cases.
Travellers from the US have accounted for 172 cases since December 11 while Papua New Guinea’s COVID-19 crises has contributed 108 cases to Australian hotel quarantine.

Australian cricket legend Michael Hussey has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.
The 45-year-old was working as a batting coach for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, and is one of many Australians trapped in the country following Scott Morrison’s decision to introduce a hard border closure.
Early on Wednesday morning AEST, The Times of India reported Hussey had become the first Australian in the IPL bubble to test positive for the coronavirus.
According to the publication, he was tested twice with both coming back positive.
The glamorous T20 tournament was indefinitely suspended on Tuesday evening after several cricketers and staff members contracted the virus.
The Kolkata Knight Riders were placed in isolation after players Varun Chakravarthy and Sandeep Warrier tested positive on Monday, along with three staff members from the Super Kings — chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan, bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji and a bus cleaner.
The IPL decided to take an indefinite pause on Tuesday as Sunrisers Hyderabad wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha — a teammate of David Warner — joined the growing list.
Television crew and venue staff also contracted coronavirus as the integrity of the tournament’s biosecurity bubble was compromised.
Hussey played 79 Test matches and 185 one-day internationals for Australia, scoring 22 centuries and 11,677 runs.
He featured in the 2006/07 Ashes whitewash and 2007 Cricket World Cup triumph.

More than 30 Australian players, commentators, umpires and coaching staff participated in the IPL — including Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell and Ricky Ponting.
The Australian talent in India now face an anxious wait to get home, with Morrison’s Government introducing fines of up to $66,600 or five years in prison for anyone defying the strict travel ban — currently in place until May 15.
On Tuesday, Warner shared an emotional Instagram post with a message from his daughters and wife with a desperate plea: “Please Daddy come home straight away”.
Stay safe daddy, come home soon we love you. @davidwarner31pic.twitter.com/VXkrIzWomx
The temporary travel ban was designed to allow for hotel quarantine upgrades in Australia before an influx of citizens fleeing COVID-ravaged India.
Last week, Morrison said Australian cricket players and coaches in India would not be given preferential treatment.
“They’ve travelled there privately under their own arrangements. This wasn’t part of an Australian tour,” Morrison said.
“And they’re under their own resources and they’ll be using those resources, I’m sure, to see them return to Australia in accordance with our own arrangements.”
The Aussies knew they would be required to spend 14 days in quarantine upon returning home — they did not anticipate being locked out of the country with a threat of jail time.

“Up until now, I felt incredibly safe in the bubble they created,” Cummins told Fox Sports’ Back Page from his Ahmedabad hotel room on Tuesday.
“Arriving, we had to do seven days quarantine, tests every two days, we had to wear masks in the hotel, literally the only people we have seen are hotel staff who are getting tested every day and members of our team.
“Once we flew out from Australia, we knew we faced 14 days quarantine coming home, so you always feel that little bit further away from getting home, but as soon as that hard border shut, obviously no one has ever experienced that before.
“It added a little bit of anxiety for some of the Aussies over here, but hopefully it all opens on May 15 and we are able to get back.”
Earlier this week, Indian coach Ravi Shastri told SEN that the IPL bubbles were the safest place in India.
Kolkata teammate Ben Cutting told Fox Sports: “Last year we had the IPL held over in the UAE and that was, you know, an incredibly, incredibly well run tournament. No hiccups at all.
“I think this year they tried to push that little step further and have it over in multiple cities in India. So I’m sure looking back, there might have tweaked a few things.
“It’s a shame, and there’s obviously there’s been a few cases in the last couple of days.
“Up until now felt incredibly safe and confident in the bubble they’ve created.”
IPL commentator and former Australian Test batter Michael Slater flew to the Maldives on the weekend, where he will wait until he can legally return home.
According to The Australian, some of the 30-odd Australians are considering a similar move — there is also talk of ordering a charter flight to Dubai.
Slater tweeted on Monday evening: “If our Government cared for the safety of Aussies they would allow us to get home. It’s a disgrace!
“Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this. How about you sort out quarantine system.
“I had government permission to work on the IPL but I now have government neglect.”
Australian cricketers Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson returned home last week before the travel restrictions were introduced.
Last month, West Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh and New South Wales paceman Josh Hazlewood abandoned their IPL commitments before travelling to Asia.
India is recording approximately 360,000 cases and 3500 deaths a day and has been hit by chronic shortages of hospital beds and oxygen.
A huge international effort is underway to deliver much-needed oxygen to cities around India where coronavirus cases have skyrocketed to the point where people infected, including babies, have died while waiting for treatment outside hospitals.
Long queues were seen at vaccination centres across the weekend, with people desperate to be inoculated against a disease that has overwhelmed the healthcare system.
Social media platforms have been flooded with pleas from people looking for oxygen cylinders, medicines and hospital beds as the COVID-19 wave causes widespread shortages.
Last week, Cummins donated $50,000 to help the nation fight the outbreak, calling for other players to contribute.

Cricket Australia and the Australia Cricketers’ Association released a joint statement on Tuesday following the IPL’s decision to postpone the tournament.
“CA is in direct contact with the BCCI as they work through plans to ensure the safe accommodation and repatriation of Australian players, coaches, match officials and commentators back home to Australia,” the statement read.
“CA and the ACA respect the decision of the Australian Government to pause travel from India until at least May 15 and will not seek exemptions.
“CA and the ACA thank the BCCI for their efforts and co-operation for the safe repatriation of all participants at the IPL.”
India is scheduled to host the Men’s T20 World Cup in October, with several reports suggesting the event could be moved to the United Arab Emirates.

A new study has found where passengers should sit on a flight for the best chance of avoiding COVID-19, due to the ways planes are boarded.

Passengers who want to reduce their risk of catching COVID when flying should book tickets at the front of the plane.
That’s according to a new study which found boarding planes from the back to the front doubles the risk of exposure to the virus.
The report, published in the Royal Society Open Science journal, also suggested limiting use of overhead luggage compartments and seating window seat passengers first would further help to reduce COVID spread.
The study analysed the spread of the virus in plane cabins. It came after a number of US airlines changed their boarding processes, reversing their usual front-to-back seating instead to boarding passengers at the rear of the cabin first, with the theory it would stop passengers having to walk past already-seated passengers at the front of the plane.
However, the study found that doing it this way actually doubled the risk.

This is because of the closer contact between passengers in the same rows as they form in the aisles while they put their luggage in the overhead compartments.
“Back-to-front procedures do, indeed, reduce contacts between seated passengers and those moving in the aisle,” the report said. “However, this is not the primary generator of social proximity. An increase in contacts between passengers who are both in the aisle or both seated makes the new procedures substantially worse than the previous one and even more when compared with using a single zone.”

Overhead compartments also increases virus spread risk
Stopping travellers from using the overhead storage compartments could also play a role in reducing risk, the report said.
“Our results show that while the original boarding procedures were substantially worse than they could have been, the new boarding procedures further worsen infection risk by increasing social proximity,” it said.
“Prohibiting the use of overhead bins to stow luggage, and boarding the window seat before the aisle seat, can ameliorate this.”
Last year research from scientists at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, discovered that those sitting in window seats had fewer interactions with other passengers – beyond those sitting within two rows of them – thus limiting their chances of interacting with someone who had COVID-19.

The Victorian quarantine manager at the centre of a scandal over breached infection protocols has been stood down from his role.

Confidential documents revealed a senior bureaucrat in Victoria’s government who was responsible for managing COVID-19 quarantine control breached protocols on two separate occasions.

According to The Australian - who broke the story - General Manager Matiu Bush breached protocols on April 20 when he went to exit the InterContinental hotel and refused to receive the mandatory quarantine test when asked by health workers.

The second incident occurred on March 1 when he went to the Pullman hotel but failed to check in on his personal QR code system before visiting another hotel where he failed to sanitise his hands or change his face mask.

Dozens of other breaches have been noted including unvaccinated contractors being allowed to carry out routine maintenance on quarantine hotels and a health worker vaping inside isolation facilities.

A senior hotel quarantine bureaucrat who allegedly refused to take a COVID test has been stood down, following the leaking of confidential documents into the state’s hotel quarantine system overnight.
Victorian Police Minister Danny Pearson confirmed he asked Matiu Bush, who had been managing infection prevention across the state’s hotel quarantine scheme, to stand down after being made aware of reports of breaches published in The Australian.
According to the article, Bush was reported to authorities twice since March after defying a Defence Force request for a mandatory COVID-19 test and breaching infection-control protocols.
The newspaper obtained dozens of daily confidential reports spanning January to April that documented hundreds of breaches and incidents by people involved in the hotel quarantine scheme.
According to the report, Bush was counselled over the April 20 incident and took a COVID test later that day. He was also counselled for an earlier incident on March 1.

An operational incidents review obtained by The Australian claimed when Bush went to check out of the Intercontinental Hotel on April 20, they were asked by an ADF corporal if they’d had a test.
Bush had been onsite for almost four hours and reportedly replied, “I’m the head of IPC and I override that protocol” and left the hotel without signing out.
A second incident detailed in the newspaper claimed Bush and two other government staffers allegedly refused to sign in via a QR code, claiming they were vaccinated.
They also reportedly did not sanitise or change masks, and Bush failed to sign out upon departure.
Addressing reporters outside Parliament House on Wednesday, Mr Pearson said he was concerned about the former manager’s attitude and behaviour rather than the risk of infection.
Mr Pearson said Bush had been stood down pending a review into the conduct of his alleged behaviour.
Taking to Twitter, Victorian opposition MP Georgie Crozier called for a harsher penalty.
“Stood down! Not good enough … needs to go. Today!” Ms Crozier posted.
Stood down! Not good enough... needs to go. Today! #springsthttps://t.co/tNFocMk5F7
The leaking of the report has identified serious breaches in the state’s hotel quarantine system, including a nurse trying to give a returned traveller a banned nebuliser and a frontline medical officer vaping inside a quarantine hotel despite being warned by health staff the e-cigarette mist could promote “viral spread”.
The report also found the Holiday Inn COVID-19 outbreak that sparked Victoria’s third lockdown last year was allegedly caused by the “lengthy swabbing” of an unmasked woman in an open doorway.
According to the COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria Infection Prevention and Control, obtained by The Australian, the virus, “previously contained” in the woman’s room, was blown down the corridor by airconditioning before ”pooling outside the door” of the room where the man with the nebuliser was staying with his partner and infant.
One of the adults became infected by picking up meals from outside their room door or putting out rubbish, the report said.
Within days, the trio all had the virus, with the nebuliser aiding transmission of the virus in the room and “pushing it back into the corridor, infecting food and beverage workers delivering meals to residents‘ doors”.

In a heated parliamentary question time on Wednesday, Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien accused the Victorian government of not addressing perceived flaws in the system.
“Over 800 Victorians died last year when Labor’s hotel quarantine system failed,” he said.
“Today’s revelations of breaches prove the government has not learnt the lessons from those tragic deaths or from the inquiry that followed.
“A minister is responsible for everything that occurs – why has no minister taken responsibility for these shocking failures and resigned?”
Deputy Premier James Merlino reiterated Bush had been stood down due to their attitude and leadership and said the government had implemented the recommendations of the hotel quarantine inquiry.
He said any breaches were reported, escalated and actioned and the scheme had continuous oversight from health authorities.
“Speaker, hotel quarantine has never, ever been a zero risk environment – never has and never will be,” Mr Merlino said.”
“We’ve seen infection prevention control breaches in every jurisdiction across this country, what we’ve put in place (has had) the smallest breaches.”
Mr O’Brien questioned why the government had blamed February’s lockdown on a man using a nebuliser when the leaked reports stated otherwise.
“The nebuliser was a significant contributor to that outbreak, full stop” Mr Merlino fired back.
“The leader of the opposition is completely and utterly wrong as per usual.”

Pfizer sharply increased its 2021 profit&nbsp;projections on Tuesday, citing much higher Covid-19 vaccine sales which are on track to provide a &quot;durable&quot; revenue stream in the wake of the pandemic.
The drugmaker reported a jump in first-quarter profits based on surging revenues, with nearly one-fourth of sales coming from Covid-19 vaccines.
But the surging profits have drawn criticism as governments face pressure to step in to ensure vaccines are provided to underserved countries.
The company is studying the efficacy of giving the jabs six or more months after the second vaccine dose, and developing doses that could be stored at standard refrigerated temperature for up to 10 weeks.
"It is our hope that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will continue to have a global impact by helping to get the devastating pandemic under control and helping economies around the world not only open, but stay open," Bourla said in prepared remarks.
Pfizer has won wide praise for its technological prowess in developing a game-changing vaccine in record time. However, critics called the profits troubling given the divide in vaccine availability between rich and poor countries.
India and South Africa are leading an effort in the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property and patent rules, at least temporarily, which would open the door to broader production of vaccines at a time when the virus is causing mass misery in India and some other countries.
Biden also said he was ready to "immediately" begin vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds as soon as Pfizer's Covid shot is approved by regulators for the age group.
Pfizer reported net income of $4.9 billion, up 45 percent from the same period of the prior year.
The results include the lift from Covid-19 vaccines, which generated profit margins of "high-20s," implying around $900 million in profits in the most recent quarter.
The company has reached an agreement to provide up to 40 million doses for Covax, a globally-pooled coronavirus vaccine procurement effort aimed at providing vaccines to low- and middle-income economies.
- Criticism of profits -
The company said it is charging $19.50 per vaccine dose in the United States, but has not disclosed its US profit margin.
"Pfizer is cashing in on the crisis and hoarding technology, even as billions of people around the world go without a vaccine," Rizvi said in an email to AFP.
The company is building more capacity and expects to manufacture at least three billion doses in 2022, up from 2.5 billion now expected in 2021. In February, Pfizer said it expected to produce up to two billion doses in 2021.

Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says there is no doubt the biggest issue for Australians going to an election is they do not want COVID-19 cases.

This comes after the federal government barred any arrivals from India until at least May 15 due to the surging coronavirus cases.

“You only need to look at the Queensland, WA, and Tasmania election results to see what people think. They agree with Scott Morrison on this,” Mr Clennell said.

“Any hard border measures will be supported.”

Outback Queensland’s economy has shown remarkable resilience throughout the COVID-19 crisis despite the heavy impact of the pandemic on many coastal tourism spots. 

Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said “outback Queensland weathered the storm of COVID the best of any part of Queensland and as a consequence they’ve helped strengthen our Queensland economy during a very difficult time”. 

“We’re responding to that, we’re returning that investment back to western Queensland.” 

Meeting in Longreach, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and her ministers outlined investments in “key issues” including in agriculture, transport and education. 

“8000 kilometres of cluster fencing which is bringing back the sheep industry out here as well where the lambing rates are in excess of 80 to 85 per cent. So once again that was a matter of people bringing that to our attention and us delivering,” Ms Palaszczuk said.

Confidential documents have revealed a senior bureaucrat in Victoria’s government who was responsible for managing COVID-19 quarantine control breached protocols on two separate occasions. 

General Manager of COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria’s Infection Prevention and Control Matiu Bush is the figure at the centre of these new allegations laid out by The Australian newspaper.

On April 20 Mr Bush reportedly went to exit the InterContinental hotel quarantine facility and refused to have the mandatory quarantine test when asked by health workers, claiming he had the authority to do so.

The second incident occurred on March 1 when he went to the Pullman hotel but failed to check in on his personal QR code system before visiting another hotel where he failed to sanitise his hands or change his face mask.

The revelations surrounding Mr Bush’s breaches in infection control have been accompanied by a secret report also obtained by The Australian attributing Victoria’s third outbreak to a previously unknown incident.

The report found the virus escaped into a hotel corridor after a woman in the hotel quarantine system was swabbed by a health worker in an open doorway and not by a nebuliser as previously thought.

The Indian government has insisted daily coronavirus cases in the country easing despite the nation recording 355,000 new cases on Tuesday. 

It brings the total number to more than 20 million but there are questions about the accuracy of figures, especially in remote areas.

The head of a Delhi hospital has told Sky News Correspondent Alex Crawford that although his hospital is already overwhelmed, he believes things will get even worse.

India’s virus caseload has topped a gargantuan number, forcing the suspension of the world’s richest Twenty20 cricket tournament.

India’s coronavirus caseload topped 20 million on Tuesday as the relentless surge finally forced the suspension of the nation’s lucrative cricket competition involving some of the sport’s biggest global stars.
The South Asian nation’s plight was in stark contrast to Europe and the United States, where mass vaccinations have allowed the easing of many coronavirus restrictions.
More than 350,000 new cases were reported in India Tuesday, a drop from the peak of 402,000 last week, giving some cause for optimism that the worst of the devastating wave may have passed. But daily deaths are still high at 3500.

“If daily cases and deaths are analysed, there is a very early signal of movement in the positive direction,” senior health ministry official Lav Aggarwal told reporters.
“But these are very early signals. There is a need to further analyse it.”

India’s healthcare infrastructure has struggled to cope with the huge number of cases, with deep shortages of medicines, hospital beds and medical oxygen.
But the glitzy Indian Premier League, the world’s richest Twenty20 cricket tournament, had carried on in empty stadiums, sparking criticism that it was inappropriate under the circumstances.
Organisers said they did not want to compromise the safety of staff and players, including some of the world’s biggest cricket stars from India, Australia, England and New Zealand.
“These are difficult times, especially in India and while we have tried to bring in some positivity and cheer … it is imperative that the tournament is now suspended,” they said in a statement.
More states are beginning to implement lockdown across the country as its vaccination program falters after reaching an all-time high last month.
On April 5 the country hit a peak of 4.5 million but that number has since dropped to below two million.
Clinics in one of its worst hit cities, Delhi, a handful of clinics have begun vaccinating young adults.
The wave in the South Asian nation — spurred by huge gatherings including the Hindu festival Kumbh Mela — has highlighted the danger of COVID-19, which has already claimed more than 3.2 million lives worldwide.
Religious events are a threat in neighbouring Pakistan too, where authorities are battling a third wave of infections and urging Muslims to observe precautions during the Islamic month of Ramadan.
Despite the warnings, thousands of Shia Muslims — many not wearing masks — gathered in the eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday for an annual religious procession.
Pakistani authorities have largely avoided clamping down on such religious activities in recent months even as markets and schools have been closed.

EU eyes travel resumption
Leaders in Europe, meanwhile, were looking to take further steps towards recovery with a proposal to revive international travel and tourism as early as next month.
The European Commission proposed Monday that travellers who are fully vaccinated with EU-approved shots or those coming from countries where COVID-19 is under control should be allowed to enter the bloc.
The EU has so far approved the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines.
But in a sign that the pandemic is not yet over in Europe, Germany cancelled its world-famous Oktoberfest beer festival for a second year running.
Americans are among those eyeing possible European vacations this summer, with more than 100 million people in the United States now fully vaccinated.
US media reported Monday that authorities were expected to authorise the Pfizer shot for children aged 12 and up.
The successful drive has allowed authorities in many parts of the world’s biggest economy to start relaxing curbs, including New York and Florida.
And in China, where the virus first emerged in 2019, millions of tourists have flocked to domestic tourist attractions with the country’s outbreak largely under control.
Beijing’s historic alleyways were packed with camera-wielding visitors Tuesday, after out-of-towners also mobbed popular sites in Shanghai over the weekend.
WHO plea to G7
But in hard-hit Brazil, vaccine shortages have forced several large cities to suspend administering second doses of the Chinese-developed CoronaVac shot.
COVID-19 has claimed more than 400,000 lives in Brazil — second only to the United States.
Warning about the global inequality in access to COVID-19 supplies, the WHO said Monday that rich countries must step up their funding for vaccines, tests and treatments in poorer nations if the pandemic is to be brought to an end.
“We will only solve the vaccine crisis with the leadership of these countries,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, urging decisive action at the G7 summit in June.

Sky News host Peter Gleeson says "the hotel quarantine fiasco in Victoria is real", the Coate Inquiry was "essentially a whitewash", and the system needs a royal commission.

A senior Andrews government bureaucrat managing infection prevention across Victoria's hotel quarantine program has been reported to authorities twice since March after defying a Defence Force request for a mandatory COVID-19 test and breaching infection-control protocols.

PR Counsel Principal Kristy McSweeney said Victorian taxpayers should not forget the parade of ministers walking in front of the inquiry, backed by barristers and various QCs to defend ministers "and not tell us anything at all".

The Australian’s Adam Creighton says the rest of the world “will have moved on” by the time COVID-19 quarantine facilities have been built.

Speaking on the issue of jobs, he said it is the “right imperative” for Australia to bring in and quarantine people who add to the productivity of the nation.

“Indeed some states, it seems, are already designating areas to build quarantine facilities, but I do raise one issue there," Mr Creighton told Sky News host Alan Jones.

“By the time these quarantine facilities are finished – which will probably be one to two years away given how slow everything is in the public sector – the rest of the world will have moved on.

“And then there’s Australia quarantining everyone; I mean it’s going to be rather amusing.”

The Democrats' push for President Biden to loosen vaccine patents so every country can produce their own vaccine has created an "international fight" for "vaccine diplomacy", according to Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen.

"They want to see all this technology all around the world so countries can start their own local production to try and counter this COVID-19 pandemic from the developing countries - which as we've seen in India has become the real battleground in this pandemic," she told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.

"In a broader picture this has become an international fight for vaccine diplomacy - Australia is engaging in this as well through the quad alliance.

"And it's because China has become the really big player in this - they're producing billions of vaccinations.

"But the advantage that China has here is that they have a hand in every single pharmaceutical company which are geared up to do this.

"The argument coming from pretty powerful players in the US, including Bill Gates, has been that there shouldn't be a compromise in the intellectual property of pharmaceutical giants - that this could set a very dangerous precedent - especially to force their hand."

There are "question marks" over the Biosecurity Act's "constitutionality" and whether the Act's requirements have been met for this particular India "travel ban", according to Citizenship expert Kim Rubenstein.

The Biosecurity Act was invoked due to an escalating COVID-19 situation in India which allows the government to impose a $66,000 fine and a five-year jail term for breaking the travel ban.

"There are two issues here with this travel ban. One is the question of the constitutionality of it and there are serious questions as to whether it is constitutional," she told Sky News.

"While we don't have an explicit citizenship right in the constitution - nor do we have a bill of rights - there is recognition that individuals as citizens have rights to return to their own country under international law and as a fundamental rule of law notion.

"There are also questions to do with the Biosecurity Act under which this determination has been made and its that Biosecurity Act, that has question marks about its constitutionality.

"But also more specifically, the actual section which provides for the minister to make the determination has clear requirements ... there are question marks as to whether they've been met for this particular travel ban."

A former Socceroo has hit out and revealed more about his life as he has spent more than half the year in hotel quarantine.
India has passed a grim new milestone in its fight against COVID as the country recorded over 400,000 cases in a day.
Erik Paartalu has been away from home for too long.Source:Instagram
Former Socceroo Erik Paartalu has revealed he has been confined to a hotel for the past seven months due to the COVID-19 crisis in India.
Paartalu, who played two matches for the Socceroos in 2013 as well as a 119 caps in the A-League for the Brisbane Roar and Melbourne City as well as stints across the world, plays for Bengalaru in the Indian Super League.

Despite playing his last match of the Indian domestic season on Feburary 26 after the club missed the final, Paartalu has been stuck in the club’s biosecurity bubble, with Bengalaru preparing for an AFC Cup qualifying match on May 11 against the Maldives' Club Eagles.
The AFC Cup is the secondary club competition in Asia with the winners qualifying for the AFC Champions League.
While other foreign players left at the culmination of the season, Paartalu has been stuck in limbo.
Last week, he hit out at the Australian government after the Morrison government introduced fines of up to $66,600 or five years in prison for anyone defying the travel ban preventing Australians returning home from India
India’s COVID-19 outbreak is breaking records with more than 400,000 new cases on Sunday alone, with the nation registering more than 3000 deaths a day over the last week.
It is believed these are being under reported as well, with the world shocked by the scenes of death coming out of the nation.

On April 30, Paartalu expressed his disappointment at being stranded in the stricken nation.
“As an Aussie that has lived and worked in India for 4 years now I have never felt so far away from feeling Australian. I don’t know how you can deny citizens to return home especially when there are hotel quarantines in place,” he wrote.
I understand everyone's concern with the level of infection over here and the possibility of a new variant. But isn't that the purpose of hotel quarantine for 14 days? Love to all those affected and hope this situation has a good outcome for all the Aussies here in India 💙
It came after Aussie cricket stars Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson exposed a loophole on the border closure with India, flying home from the IPL via Doha last week.
The loophole was soon closed with gateway destinations, including Doha, Dubai, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur also suspending travel.
It led to the extraordinary tirade from Aussie cricket great Michael Slater, who was commentating the IPL.
Slater has found his way to the Maldives, where he will stay until he can return to Australia, taking to Twitter to savage the Australian government.
Slater tweeted on Monday evening: “If our Government cared for the safety of Aussies they would allow us to get home. It’s a disgrace!
“Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this. How about you sort out quarantine system.
“I had government permission to work on the IPL but I now have government neglect.”

But speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Paartalu revealed he has only been able to travel from his hotel room to either train or play, having been in the biosecure bubble since the Indian Super League season began.
While he admitted that the team was relatively lucky, several of his teammates have had family members die from the virus.
Paartalu has also been separated from his family who are in Sydney and his wife in Scotland while he is stranded in India.
“It’s a horrible thing to say but I don’t think anybody is coping,” Paartalu said. “You get past a point where it just becomes exhausting. We are all past that point now and it just becomes a really sad normality. You have a set routine every day: you wake up, have breakfast, go to training, go to the gym, come back to the hotel, eat, sleep.”

A butcher’s shop has banned vaccinated customers from entering the store for a month after their jab in a move condemned as “madness”.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

Coronavirus has spawned almost as many wild theories as infections – from evil government plots to 5G towers transmitting COVID-19.
Now, with the vaccine rolling out, another crop of misinformation is doing the rounds of social media. And it’s making virus watchers shake their heads in dismay.
According to some, mRNA vaccines – such as the US-German Pfizer-BioNTech jab – can lead pregnant women to miscarry. This, apparently, is due to people “shedding” the vaccine to those who have not had the shot.
Epidemiologists have said there is no evidence to back up the fanciful claims and vaccine “shedding” is not a thing.
A butcher in Toronto is the latest to assert that the Pfizer vaccine could pose “side effects” to women.
He caused a small social media storm on the weekend when he announced on his Instagram account that anyone who had been vaccinated in the previous 28 days would have to remain outside the premises and instead be served on the street “to protect women”.
Dr Jen Gunter, a respected Canadian gynaecologist tweeted about the butcher’s claims and summed it up as “this is madness”.
Another doctor has said it’s a “dangerous” conspiracy designed to “weaken trust” in vaccines.
Canada is currently in a third wave of COVID-19 with around 8000 new cases a day. The province of Alberta now has more daily cases per capita than any other part of Canada or the US.

Butcher bans vaccinated customers
The social media account for the butchers, based in a northern suburb of Toronto, was previously focused on special offers and recipes. It is now concerned less about meat and more about opposition to masks and vaccines.
In a rambling video, owner Yehuda Goldberg said he was “taking a stand” for his customers many of who were “younger women in child-bearing years”.
He said numerous people in his neighbourhood had received a COVID-19 vaccine which he was not “judging “people for. He then appeared to judge the very same people.
“When you put your life and you put those around you in harm’s way, we will stand up and protect those who are not able to speak up.”

Mr Goldberg said that “for 28 days if you’ve been vaccinated, I’m asking you to please avoid coming into our store”. If the vaccinated must shop with him, he will only serve them outside the store.
In the video he cites a document from Pfizer that, he claims, shows women could have “issues” if they come into contact with someone who is vaccinated.
“Let’s say I get vaccinated and I then I shake hands with my friend who has a pregnant wife, his wife can have issues, it doesn’t mean that she will. It’s that there is a chance of it.”
The butcher said he only acts on “concrete evidence” but the evidence in this case seems flimsy.

Wild claims vaccine uniquely affects women
It seems to be the latest iteration of a conspiracy theory that the vaccine can be “shed” by those who have received the jab.
The Pfizer document used as evidence appears to be a November 2020 paper that lays out the criteria for a study into the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccine.
The study specifically sought to exclude pregnant women.
The document states that if a woman who takes part in the study becomes pregnant or a pregnant woman is exposed to someone who is taking part in the study Pfizer should be notified so the firm can study for any side effects.
Like in any medical trial, some of the participants would have received a placebo so could be contracting and transmitting COVID-19 despite thinking they were immune.
“A conspiracy designed to weaken trust”
The US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has noted that all pregnancies have a risk of birth defect or miscarriage and has warned against automatically linking such an outcome with a vaccine.
There has been anecdotal evidence that some women have seen changes to their menstrual cycles after getting the vaccine. More studies may reveal it to be a minor side effect, like muscle pain or a fever.
“Anecdotal reports of some menstrual irregularities is not a reason to avoid getting the vaccine,” said Michelle Wise from the University of Auckland’s gynaecology department on website The Conversation.
“Getting infected with COVID-19 is much more likely to interfere with your health, including your menstrual health.”
There is limited data on COVID-19 vaccines and pregnant women. However, no specific safety concerns have been raised from the millions of vaccines administered.
The FDA added that in tests on pregnant female rats given the mRNA vaccine no adverse effects were seen.
However, pregnant women are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
As for the virus “shedding,” it doesn’t stack up.
“This is a conspiracy that has been created to weaken trust in a series of vaccines that have been demonstrated in clinical trials to be safe and effective,” Dr Christopher Zahn of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists told Reuters.

“Such conspiracies and false narratives are dangerous and have nothing to do with science.”
Vaccines cannot be passed from one person to another simply by being in the same vicinity. Quite simply, it’s not contagious.
“There is no way for a COVID-19 vaccinated person to ‘shed vaccine,’” the US Centres for Disease Control’s COVID-19 clinical team stated.
The COVID-19 virus can be “shed” by those infected and transmitted to others. But vaccines don’t use live viruses so there is no live virus to shed.
However, there may a small number of cases of fully vaccinated people who can still be infected and transmit the virus.
Mr Goldberg seems to have been stung by the backlash to his rule that the vaccinated cannot enter his store. In a further post on Monday, he said “fear” was leading people to turn on him.
Medical authorities have said people with questions about vaccines should consult their local GP, not their local butcher.

A man has returned a weak positive to coronavirus after leaving hotel quarantine in Melbourne and travelling to another state.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

A man in regional Western Australia has been diagnosed with COVID-19 after quarantining in a Melbourne hotel, but health authorities have described the case as a “very weak positive”.
The Health Department said the positive test result was most likely evidence of an historic infection.
The man, aged in his 30s, recently returned to Collie after travelling to Australia from Poland and quarantining in Melbourne for two weeks.
“He tested negative to COVID-19 on all his tests while in hotel quarantine,” the department said.
“On his return to Collie, he was retested as part of Vic Health’s follow-up of people post-quarantine.
“He returned a very weak positive result, which is sometimes seen in people with old, recovered infections.”

Out of an abundance of caution, the man has been retested.
His three closest contacts have also been told to isolate pending test results, including antibody tests, which are expected to return on Wednesday.
“We are asking the community not to panic and to be assured that WA Health will advise the community if results indicate this is an infectious case,” the department said.
Premier Mark McGowan took to social media to explain why the Health Department had advised the risk to the community was low.
“Long story short — a man who had returned from overseas and completed hotel quarantine in Victoria has returned a very weak positive test result, which is sometimes seen in people who have recovered from an infection previously,” he said.
“WA Health believes the test result most likely reflects an historic infection but out of an abundance of caution is now retesting the man to clarify his infection status.
“We will provide updates and advise the community if results indicate this is an infectious case.”

The Perth and Peel regions narrowly avoided going into another lockdown after a quarantine security guard at the Pan Pacific Hotel and two of his housemates tested positive for COVID-19.
A total of 79 close contacts have been identified, with 49 of those returning a negative result so far.
A further 429 casual contacts have been identified, with 134 having returned a negative result so far.
The community has been forced to wear masks in public and sport has been played without crowds in recent days under a raft of restrictions imposed.
Most restrictions are expected to be lifted by Saturday and Mr McGowan has flagged giving an update on the situation later this week.

In an instant, Contiki went from hundreds of tours across six continents to nothing. Now, it’s finally getting back to what it does best.
New Zealanders will soon be able to travel to the Cook Islands under a new travel bubble.

It was the news Australians waited a year to hear.
When New Zealand finally announced the trans-Tasman travel bubble last month, it brought relief to those aching to see loved ones and hope to frustrated travellers keen for an adventure.
At youth travel company Contiki, the announcement was its green light to get back to what it did best – helping young people discover the world.
Now, more than a year after global tours were aborted due to the worsening coronavirus crisis, the first international Contiki trip since the pandemic is about to set off in New Zealand.
Contiki is offering 11 tours across the ditch, with the first cab off the rank, the Sweet As tour of the South Island, departing on May 23.
The company brought back Australian domestic tours at the end of last year but international travel was what everyone was really waiting for. As soon as the trans-Tasman travel bubble was announced last month, Contiki saw bookings of its New Zealand tours skyrocket by 300 per cent.
“We’ve had trips in Australia, and people have been excited about seeing their own backyard, but the essence of Contiki is seeing the world,” Contiki Australia’s managing director Katrina Barry told news.com.au.

“It’s really nice to see borders finally reopening and groups of young people are able to come together and connect with each other through their love of travel.
“I think people have been feeling a little bit gypped that 2020 took that away from us, that big overseas holiday or that gap year, and we know the younger generation has been more open to travelling as soon as they can.”
Research by Contiki into the travel attitudes of 18 to 35-year-olds found not only were they raring to get out and see the world, they missed opportunities to meet strangers and make friends overseas.
“There had been a bit of a trend towards younger people being a bit too cool to go on a group trip, but they’re telling us that now, they’re really missing connecting with other people,” Ms Barry said.
“Contiki is flavour of the month now. They’re realising they can go overseas and meet people from all over the world and a company is going to make sure the experience is fun but safe for them.”

It had been a long year for the travel industry, and tour operators in particular, since international borders slammed shut in March last year. Contiki’s entire global network of hundreds of tours across six continents was brought to a standstill.
“No one knew how long it would go on,” Ms Barry said. “But we thought, never waste a crisis. What can we do that will make us smarter and better? What are the projects we’ve been wanted to do for ages but never have time to do?”
As the long months ticked by, Contiki kept busy with its sustainability strategy – it recently announced it will be an entirely carbon neutral company by 2022 – and went about vetting each of the companies it worked with on tours, from hotels and restaurants to transport operators to ensure they’d be up to top-notch standard when travel returned.

Australian trips resumed late last year, including an island-hopping tour of North Queensland, and then it was a matter of waiting for that bubble with our neighbours across the ditch.
With New Zealand tours about to get under way, Ms Barry said Contiki was already looking ahead to Singapore, which is likely to be the next destination to open a travel bubble with Australia.
“We’re thinking Japan after the Olympics as well,” she said.
As the world continues to reopen in travel bubbles, young tourists are likely to lead the charge, armed with savings and built-up annual leave, and perhaps more adventurous and flexible than older generations.
While Contiki’s best selling European tours have generally been around 14 days long, the current top selling tour is a mammoth 45-day odyssey across Europe in 2022.
“I think there’s a sense among young people of, ‘I didn’t appreciate travelling as much when it was too easy and it was constantly there for me’,” Ms Barry said.
“Now they don’t want to take it for granted and want to see and do as much as they can. They’re thinking, ‘I want a long trip, a big trip, because I don’t know when I might be able to do that again’.”

New York governor Andrew Cuomo has attempted to shift blame from his state’s disastrous handling of nursing home deaths by claiming the Trump Administration “politicised” the scandal.

Mr Cuomo refused to resign despite revelations up to half of all COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes were not reported.

“That was a political investigation started by Donald Trump who politicised not just COVID but nursing homes and policies towards nursing homes," Mr Cuomo said.

“And wanted to blame democratic governors like myself, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It was all our fault”. 

Mr Cuomo then denied any wrongdoing.

“I’ve done nothing wrong, period. I’m not resigning and I’m doing my job everyday,” he said.

The New York Governor and his administration have been accused of deliberately falsifying the number of COVID-19 related deaths in state nursing homes.

In January the New York Attorney-General Letitia James released a report showing the number of COVID-19 related deaths in nursing at least 62 state nursing homes had been underreported by up to 50 per cent. 

Last month The New York Times reported some of Cuomo aides had gone to greater lengths to hide the real numbers and had tried to stop health officials from releasing it to the public. 

The FBI are currently operating a federal investigation into the coverup.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has made a major announcement about the coronavirus vaccine that would solve a big problem.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has asked medical experts to begin the process towards being able to make COVID-19 vaccine doses in the state.
The plan is to have local manufacturers make mRNA vaccines, the same method that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use to protect against COVID-19.
Those kinds of vaccines teach cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response, which helps fortify the body against the disease.
Ms Berejiklian said the technology to make the jabs already existed in the state, and that a factory that made mRNA coronavirus vaccines also would be able to make inoculations against other diseases in the future.
She said the government had recently boosted those technological capabilities with a $25 million investment.

“This is a strategy that the NSW government strongly supports, because not only do we want to guarantee a supply here in NSW, but also develop the industry,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters.
She said she had been advised it would take between one and two years two get a pilot up and running, but that she expected to receive an updated timeline within a few weeks.
“You’re starting a new industry … You need to give yourself the right amount of time. I’m being realistic,” Ms Berejiklian said of the timeline.
The only factory that’s currently producing coronavirus vaccines, CSL in Victoria, is making the AstraZeneca version of the drug, rather than the Pfizer version.
But the Victorian government has said it also has the intention of making mRNA doses locally, injecting $50 million last month into a pilot project that they hoped would begin making jabs within 12 months.
The federal government has advised that those under 50 should get Pfizer vaccines instead of AstraZeneca jabs, because the latter carries a small risk of giving the recipient dangerous blood clots.
NSW temporarily suspended its AstraZeneca rollout last month following the commonwealth advice, but later resumed allowing medics to give out the jabs.
A total of 677,262 COVID-19 jabs had been administered in the states as of 8pm Monday.

Liberal MP Andrew Bragg says the government is “following the advice of health agencies” with regard to the temporary India travel ban and the harsh penalties for breaking the ban.

“We are following the advice of the health agencies here and putting in place the strongest possible deterrents and these are very strong deterrents,” he told Sky News. 

“It’s regrettable they are necessary but we are trying to do our best to address the situation of the transmission that’s been occurring in places like Howard Springs.”

Mr Bragg said there was “very strong community feeling” in Indian and Australian communities but data from the Northern Territory quarantine facility showed COVID-19 cases dropping. 

“I think the data that is out of again Howard Springs is already that has had the effect that’s been desired and now there’s a lower level of cases in that facility.”

Many people in India have turned to social media in a desperate bid to secure hospital beds, medicines or oxygen for Covid-19 patients
As India's pandemic has grown ever more dystopian many have volunteered in droves to help people source critical supplies such as oxygenSource:AFP
Her exam revision done, schoolgirl Swadha Prasad gets on with her real work: finding life-saving oxygen, drugs and hospital beds for Covid-19 patients as India reels from a brutal second wave of infections.
And lives have been saved, she said, pointing to a case where the team was able to source oxygen for a young Covid-19 patient in the middle of the night after an agonising two-hour wait.

A KFC store has been added to the list of venues potentially exposed to coronavirus after contact tracers poured through CCTV.
Bondi Junction GP Dr Theo Aroney says he would like to see a review of the vaccine distribution process as some smaller practices are receiving larger allocations of doses than larger practices. 'At the moment we're receiving an average of 50 COVID vaccinations a week, that equates to seven a day, I believe we could do 1,000 a week,' he said. 'We have 3,000 patients a week, 23 doctors working here, we're a travel vaccination centre as well. 'We do yellow fever, we're very experienced with vaccinating large numbers of people for flu, childhood immunisations, so I was quite excited being part of this process to vaccinate the public in a very organised manner. 'I thought it was going to be methodical and I'm disappointed we've only been given such a small allocation despite numerous requests. 'It appears to be a not negotiable scenario'. Dr Aroney told Sky News his practice would be able to send out mass emails and advertise vaccinations if they were given a larger quantity proportionate to the capacity of the clinic. 'I believe the distribution process needs to be reviewed ... ultimately I'd like to see a proportional approach, where at the moment it doesn't really have that methodology that I'd expect'.

A Coles Express, Pizza Hut, 7 Eleven service station and KFC are among the locations that have been added to the COVID-19 public exposure sites list in Perth, as contact tracing continues.
The Perth and Peel regions still have some restrictions in place, including the use of masks in public, after a hotel quarantine security guard and two of his housemates contracted coronavirus.
Western Australia did not record any new cases overnight, either in the community or in hotel quarantine.
The Health Department said it was able to add some locations to its list of places visited by confirmed cases, as well as refine details for others, following further contact tracing and a review of CCTV footage.

UNICEF has sent critical medical supplies to India as the country battles a severe second wave of COVID-19 – including 3000 oxygen concentrators, diagnostic tests and medical kits. 

The organisation is also calling for millions more donations from other countries. 

UNICEF’s India representative Dr Yasmin Haque told Sky News they were really focusing on “how we can be supporting children who are very badly affected by this pandemic”. 

“Keeping the focus on children so that we don’t lose count of the children who have lost parents, the children [whose] parents have lost livelihoods, especially the poorer children, where children are continuing to struggle with remote learning.”

West Australian health authorities are racing to confirm test results of more than 200 close and casual contacts of a hotel quarantine worker who infected his housemates with COVID-19.
No new cases were detected in the community or in state-managed hotel quarantine in the previous 24 hours, Premier Mark McGowan confirmed on Tuesday morning.
“Contact tracing in relation to the Pan Pacific cluster is ongoing,” he said.
“Of the 79 close contacts, 49 have come back negative and the others are pending.
“Of the 429 casual contacts, 234 are negative and we expect that number will grow today as we wait for further results to come through.”
It comes as new locations have been added to the public exposure sites list.
While Perth has so far avoided another lockdown after the three cases of community transmission were detected over the weekend, Mr McGowan confirmed the Perth Glory A-League game on Wednesday night would be played without a crowd.

Mr McGowan also said the state government was rolling out a $2m grants program to support health initiatives for India.
“We will work with local community groups here in WA to provide support to India through whatever can be done,” he said.
“There are local Indian groups providing support into India, we will assist them with funding.
“If they are able to acquire PPE or oxygen, we’ll support them to get as much into India as possible.
“What’s happening in India is a human tragedy. As a state we want to make sure we do our bit. The sooner it gets resolved, the better.”
WA carried out 7534 tests in the last 24 hours, and there are 26 active cases in hotels and hospitals.

Doctors in the India have called the coronavirus crisis a national disaster as hospitals struggle with an influx of patients and a lack critical supplies to keep those patients alive.

For the 12th consecutive day India has reported more than 300,000 new COVID-19 infections. 

This had led doctors to call on the Indian government and intentional authorities to send more help as health workers scramble hour to hour to find oxygen. 

Many patients have been forced to travel around to multiple hospitals and wait outside in emergency vehicles struggling to breathe before they find one which is able to accept them.

Sky News contributor Stephen Conroy says Prime Minister Scott Morrison is “making an embarrassing backdown” after admitting the harsh penalties to those who breach the India travel ban are unlikely to be enforced.

“I think the prime minister is making an embarrassing backdown after a truly shameful decision that him and Greg Hunt announced last week,” he told Sky News.

Mr Conroy said keeping Australian citizens in India where they could potentially catch COVID-19 and leave them to rely on India’s struggling healthcare system was “the definition of Australians being in harm’s way”.

“He locked the door to Australian citizens who desperately need to come home.”

The Medical Journal of Australia’s Professor Nick Talley says while a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine may be necessary going forward it was a better alternative to the coronavirus spreading out of control. 

“A booster may be necessary and that’s the bad news, but the good news is that’s a minor inconvenience, it’s costly of course, but a minor inconvenience compared to the virus running rampant,” he said.

Recent data has indicated just one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine may be needed for full protection in patients who have already been exposed to the coronavirus, according to Australian Medical Journal Editor Professor Nick Talley. 

He told Sky News a second dose would be necessary for full protection for those people who had had no exposure to the virus – pointing out it was important for Australians to receive both shots because most had not contracted the disease. 

Professor Talley also said both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines had proved effective against the UK strain of the virus. 

Their efficacy against other strains was relatively unknown, however, because of limited to no data about other variants, he said.

The Aussie cricketers who feel safe in their Indian Premier League biosecurity bubbles now have a way out again with a travel ban set to be lifted.
IPL: Pat Cummins' manager has asserted the star Aussie is fine despite two of his Kolkata Knightrider teammates contracting the virus.

The door for Australia’s cricketers to exit COVID-19-ravaged India has been opened again with Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirming the India travel ban will likely come to an end on May 15.
Australians stranded in the subcontinent, including 30 players, staff and officials involved in the Indian Premier League, could also be offered seats on repatriation flights.
The cricketers have been caught in a COVID outbreak that has hit two IPL teams, including superstar Pat Cummins’ Kolkata Knight Riders.
Cummins and fellow Aussie Ben Cutting have had to isolate in their hotel, with a match on Monday night cancelled, after two teammates tested positive.
It’s understood the Aussies feel safe in their biosecurity bubbles despite the virus breaching its walls.
But should they want to get out before the tournament ends, the door that was shut will now be reopened at the end of next week.
On Tuesday Australian Cricketers’ Association chief executive Todd Greenberg said the players were “fine” and went to India with their “eyes wide open”.
“Both boys are fine, I spoke to Pat last night, they’re doing pretty well all things considered,” he told 2GB on Tuesday.
“There’s obviously a lot of anxiety about making sure they can get home safely and that’s obviously tricky given some of the government restrictions that have been put in place, too.”
Morrison said the ban was likely to end on May 15.
“This is a two-week pause, this is not a permanent pause, this is not a four-month lockdown – what we’re seeking to do is ensure Australia doesn’t get a third wave of COVID across the country,” Morrison said on Tuesday morning.
“This was escalating quickly and we needed to take action to ensure that we could get the system back into a place within that fortnight so we could get those repatriation flights running again.”
There are more than 30 Australian players, commentators, umpires and coaching staff participating in the T20 tournament – including Steve Smith, David Warner and Ricky Ponting.
If our Government cared for the safety of Aussies they would allow us to get home. It's a disgrace!! Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this. How about you sort out quarantine system. I had government permission to work on the IPL but I now have government neglect
On Monday Cricket Australia boss Nick Hockley said there were no plans to organise a charter flight home for them.
Last week, Morrison said Australian cricket talent in India would not be given any preferential treatment.
“They’ve travelled there privately under their own arrangements. This wasn’t part of an Australian tour,” Morrison said.
“And they’re under their own resources and they’ll be using those resources, I’m sure, to see them return to Australia in accordance with our own arrangements.”
Three players, AJ Tye, Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa, made it back to Australia from India before the border was shut
Umpire Paul Reiffel, who tried to leave, was too late, while commentator Michael Slater made it to the Maldives where he ripped into Morrison for shutting Australians who were in India out.
Slater tweeted on Monday evening: “If our Government cared for the safety of Aussies they would allow us to get home. It’s a disgrace!
“Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this. How about you sort out quarantine system.
“I had government permission to work on the IPL but I now have government neglect.”
Morrison called that criticism “absurd”.

Australian stars Pat Cummins and Ben Cutting feature in the Knight Riders squad, along with England captain Eoin Morgan.
Cricket.com.au reported that one of the infected players recently went to hospital after suffering a stomach complaint, which is believed to be the likely time of infection.
The IPL released a statement confirming Monday’s fixture in Ahmedabad had been rescheduled.
“Both the players have isolated themselves from the rest of the squad. The Medical Team is in continuous touch with the duo and are monitoring their health. Meanwhile, the Kolkata Knight Riders have now moved towards a daily testing routine to identify any other possible cases and treat them at the earliest.,” the statement read.
“The Medical Team is also determining the close and casual contacts of the two positive cases during the 48 hours prior to collection of the sample that returned the positive test results.
“The BCCI and the Kolkata Knight Riders prioritise the health and safety of everyone involved and all measures are being taken in that endeavour.”
The Knight Riders are currently seventh on the IPL ladder, having won two of their opening seven fixtures.
Soon after, ESPNcricinfo reported three members of the Chennai Super Kings camp had also tested positive for COVID-19 — chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan, bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji and a bus cleaner.
Meanwhile, five ground staff at the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) reportedly tested positive to the virus as well, making that 10 cases in the IPL bubble all up.
The quintet had reportedly been on duty for the recent IPL match between the Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad.

For a month, we’ve heard that the IPL bubble has been the safest place to be in India. Any sort of COVID concern within that bubble then is a serious matter or so you’d think #IPL2021
The glamorous T20 tournament has proceeded without crowds as the number of coronavirus cases in India escalated at an alarming rate.
Australian cricketers Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson returned home last week as India’s coronavirus situation worsened.
There were nearly 400,000 new cases registered across India on Sunday in the world’s fastest-growing outbreak — the country of 1.3 billion also reported 3689 coronavirus deaths.
A huge international effort is underway to deliver much-needed oxygen to cities around India where coronavirus cases have skyrocketed to the point where people infected, including babies, have died while waiting for treatment outside hospitals.
Long queues were seen at vaccination centres across the weekend, with people desperate to be inoculated against a disease that has overwhelmed the healthcare system.
Social media platforms have been flooded with pleas from people looking for oxygen cylinders, medicines and hospital beds as the COVID-19 wave causes widespread shortages.
Last week, Cummins donated $50,000 to help the nation fight the outbreak, calling for other players to contribute to the PM Cares Fund.

Speaking to SEN earlier on Monday, Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said there were no plans to bring the Australian players home via a chartered flight.
“There’s no suggestion at the moment of any charter flight,” Hockley said.
“We’re working closely and talking closely with the ACA (Australian Cricketers’ Association), with the players and with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) to make sure everyone’s okay and the people have got full information.
“We’ve been in touch with the players there and they are generally in good spirits.
“The work the BCCI has done around the (biosecurity) bubble means they are feeling safe and secure, and those we’ve talked to are generally planning to complete their playing commitments.
“The BCCI have come out and said they understand and want to support the players in making sure they get home safely at the end.
“The tournament doesn’t finish until the 30th of May, so for the moment it’s monitor the situation and as we get closer to the end of the tournament we’ll need to see where the situation is at.”

As India struggles with its latest coronavirus crisis, one hospital is so bad its patients are begging to leave instead of begging for treatment.
India reported more than 300,000 new coronavirus infections for a 12th straight day on Monday to take its overall number of cases to just shy of 20 million, as scientists predicted a peak in the pandemic in the coming days. Megan Revell reports.

As India continues to struggle to contain its second wave, one makeshift hospital is so bad that patients are now “begging to leave”.
The crisis has spiked to a point where local media are calling the situation “grim”, with critical patients dropping dead in cardboard beds and on the side of the road as they wait for available space.
Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre and Hospital is a makeshift COVID-19 facility in Chhatarpur, on the outskirts of New Delhi. Its mission is to provide emergency care for the thousands struggling to breathe.
But 25-year-old Goldi Patel’s husband is not begging for oxygen there; he’s begging to leave.

Sadanand Patel, 30, is receiving such little treatment that he’s scared he will die in the very hospital that’s meant to save him.
He told CNN, “through laboured breathing” from his hospital bed: “I am very scared, if my health gets critical I don’t think they will be able to save me.”
The report said “he watched two men in beds nearby scream for medicine only to die within hours when their oxygen appeared to run out”.
But he’s not the only one. Desperate pleas scatter social media with the names of patients and desperate families pleading with Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal for more supplies.
One warned others the hospital had had no oxygen for the past 15 hours while 49-year-old Jashuwanta Bora’s oxygen was going down so fast his family pleaded for an ICU bed online.

It’s not any better outside the centre, where two women were seen crying next to a 45-year-old man who was lying on the back seat of a car. “He was not moving or responding to their calls,” The Hindu reported. Death, it seems, is inescapable here.
“We have been waiting here for two hours. Now there is no pulse. They even refused to check him even after we said that there was no pulse” Megh Singh, 60, his relative said.
India — particularly its capital, Delhi — has been hard struck by variant strains of COVID-19 and the number of deaths continues to rise despite the city being placed in lockdown two weeks ago.
India’s total COVID-19 caseload neared 20 million and oxygen shortages exacerbated a devastating second wave on Monday.
On Sunday, Delhi recorded more than 400 COVID-related deaths in a single day for the second consecutive day.
On Saturday, the city had recorded its highest ever COVID death toll in 24 hours at 412 deaths.
Worse, experts say the death rate will continue to rise with just over 3400 deaths and 368,000 new cases yesterday.
There are now 92,290 active cases of COVID-19 in Delhi, and only 20,000 COVID beds in the city’s hospitals.
Its positivity rate has been exceedingly high for the last two weeks at more than 30 per cent, or one in three tests returning a positive result.
That rate has dropped slightly to 28.33 but it’s not enough; hospitals are still overwhelmed and supplies remain critically low due to the large numbers of cases. Patients are dying on the streets, out the front of hospitals, or begging to be moved. Some die in waiting rooms before they even get to see a doctor.
Patients lying on cardboard
Only the lucky few are admitted into India’s struggling hospital system but once there, some wish they were out. Everywhere you turn, patients are breathing heavily, gasping for air, quivering.
The Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre reopened to the New Delhi community in late April boasting urgent facilities free of cost. Walk-in admissions of needy patients are accepted but generally a reference is needed. The site was closed in February when officials thought India had successfully avoided another surge.
But just two days after its April 26 opening, community members began to report serious cracks after a “huge influx” of patients. Witnesses say more than 200 patients were waiting outside the centre at 11am as chaos ensued due to lack of beds in the giant warehouse facility.
CNN said the centre even resorted to using cardboard beds and patients say they are left to fend for themselves without doctors, nurses or oxygen.
The Indian Express described the reaction as “disappointment” and “despair”.
“The condition is so bad that the patient attendants declared it a “suicide centre”, New Delhi resident Mukesh Khare said. “No water, no food, no care.”
Another called it a “death trap” and said that “patients are crying to get water and food”.

Dead body lay for hours
Patient Mr Patel said that by his fifth day at the hospital, he had watched at least five people around him die. In one case, a deceased patient’s body was left on a bed next to him “for hours” before it was removed.
“You will die lying on your bed because there’s no one to call the doctor,” he said.
In another case, one sick patient who was refused entry died outside the hospital squashed in a small car on the side of the road as she ran out of breath.
“They killed my mother. I kept crying and yelling for help but none came,” Kiran Vyas’s devastated son told media.
Officials are promising delivery of extra supplies and say more beds are on their way, but it is already too late for some.
Cases have soared by around eight million since the end of March, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi under growing pressure to take decisive action to reverse the surge.
“Oxygen is a basic requirement of a hospital and a consistent supply has not been assured. We are constantly firefighting,” the head of the Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital Dr Dinesh told the Indian Express daily.
India recorded more than 360,000 coronavirus cases in a day for the 12th day in a row as the total number of those infected according to Health Ministry data neared 20 million. Picture: Rebecca ConwaySource:Getty Images

Prince Harry spoke of “service” and received a standing ovation in his first speech since the funeral — but Meghan’s absence was a surprise.
Prince Harry addresses thousands of frontline staff workers at a concert in Los Angeles.

Prince Harry delivered a passionate speech in his first appearance since Prince Philip’s funeral at the Vax Live concert in California — but pregnant wife Meghan was notably absent.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are campaign chairs for Global Citizen’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign and had been billed to take the stage together to “deliver an important global message for vaccine equity during the event”.
Instead, Harry went solo, receiving a rock-star welcome as he addressed the crowd of thousands of vaccinated frontline workers during the taping of the star-studding concert SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.
“We are at a defining moment in the global fight against COVID-19,” said the 36-year-old, who was given a standing ovation as he appeared alongside Jennifer Lopez, Foo Fighters and Sean Penn at the “concert to reunite the world”.
He said the concert, which will be broadcast next weekend, was a celebration of the “frontline heroes” in the crowd and around the world.

“You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all,” he said, before referencing the “service” that is so often referenced by the royals.
“You served and sacrificed, put yourselves in harm’s way and with bravery knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible depth of gratitude, thank you.”
The Duke of Sussex said the virus “does not respect borders” and that “access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography”, as he made his first appearance at a public event since moving to California last year.
“Tonight, we stand in solidarity with the millions of families across India, who are battling a devastating second wave,” he added.

“We’re also coming together because this pandemic cannot end unless we act collectively with an unprecedented commitment to our shared humanity.”
He called for the vaccine to be distributed “to everyone, everywhere”, adding that “we cannot rest or truly recover until there is fair distribution to every corner of the world.”
Dressed in a blue shirt and dark pants, the prince also called vaccine disinformation a “humanitarian crisis” that is “getting worse”.
Host Selena Gomez said the concert was “the best award show of the year” and said she “geeked out” when she saw the line-up of celebrity guests and performers.
The singer called for “doses and dollars” for the world’s poorest countries, as the United States and many Western countries emerge from lockdown as their vaccination programs roll out at speed.

JLo wore a glittering pink dress as she told fans she had been forced to spend Christmas without her mother for the first time due to the pandemic. She then brought her mum on to the stage for a touching performance of Sweet Caroline.
The Foo Fighters performed Back in Black with AC/DC star Brian Johnson. Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd — many wearing uniform — “we ain’t out of the woods yet”, adding “let’s work as hard as we can to make sure we can do this” every night.
Actors Ben Affleck and Olivia Munn and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel were also among the guest stars.
President Joe Biden and First Lady Dr Jill Biden appeared in a video address, with Mr Biden saying the US was “working with leaders around the world to share more vaccines and boost production to make sure every country has the vaccines they need.”

Pope Francis also appeared by video, saying, “I beg you not to forget the most vulnerable” and calling for “a spirit of justice” to ensure “true universal access to vaccines, and a temporary suspension of intellectual property rights.”
Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan shared an urgent plea from India, where cases continue to soar, saying: “My country India is battling with the sudden surge of the second wave of COVID-19. As a global citizen I appeal to all global citizens to rise up, speak to your governments, your pharmaceutical companies, and ask them to donate, to give, to extend a helping hand to the public that needs it the most. Every effort counts.”
Other leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also appeared by video link.

Global Citizen, the advocacy group behind Sunday night’s event, announced that it had raised $53.8 million for vaccine procurement, medical tools and supplies.
Corporate and philanthropic partners have committed to donating $39.5 million to vaccine-sharing program COVAX, which is co-led by the World Health Organisation, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
Gavi will match at least $11.75 million for a total of $51.25 million to help procure nearly 10.3 million vaccine doses, exceeding the 10 million target.
Donors included Mastercard at $25 million, Cisco at $5 million and Procter & Gamble at $5 million, with Spotify contributing $500,000 to vaccines and $500,000 to medical supplies.
More announcements will be made during the YouTube broadcast at 8pm Saturday May 8 local time (10am Sunday May 9 AEST).
The campaign is also calling on governments to begin sharing vaccine doses immediately, and for pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna to urgently provide millions of doses to the poorest nations at cost pricing.
“Critically, we need to see the US and the UK step up and start sharing additional doses, and we need pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna to urgently provide millions of doses to COVAX for the poorest nations at nonprofit prices,” said Global Citizen’s Melbourne-born CEO Hugh Evans.
The concert is part of Global Citizen’s 2021 Recovery Plan for the World, a year-long campaign to help end COVID-19 for all by raising money for the World Health Organisation’s vaccine-sharing program COVAX.
“Over the past year, our world has experienced pain, loss, and struggle — together,” concert campaign chairs Harry and Meghan, 39, said in a statement on their website. “Now we need to recover and heal — together. We can’t leave anybody behind. We will all benefit, we will all be safer, when everyone everywhere has equal access to the vaccine. We must pursue equitable vaccine distribution, and in that, restore faith in our common humanity. This mission couldn’t be more critical or important.”

Sky News host Alan Jones says the federal government is likely preventing the public from seeing documents pertaining to the economic cost of COVID-19 because “it’s embarrassing”.

The Morrison government has classified 38 documents into the economic cost of various COVID-19 restrictions as cabinet documents, preventing them from being made publicly available.

“I think the response to the coronavirus in many ways was out of all proportion to the nature of the problem,” Mr Jones said.

Discussing the decision by government in relation to the documents, Mr Jones said he thinks “the one simple answer to that is most probably it’s embarrassing.”

UNSW finance professor Dr Peter Swan says the government knows the “highly secret reports” into the cost of COVID-19 lockdowns are “very bad and very revealing”.

The Morrison government has classified a series of 38 documents into the economic cost of various COVID-19 restrictions as cabinet documents, preventing them from being made publicly available.

Dr Swan told Sky News the government knew “how damaging” these reports were which was why it decided to hide them.

“How many hundreds-of-billions of dollars have been lost unnecessarily, tens-of-thousands of jobs, and businesses closed as a result of unnecessary lockdowns,” he said.

“I’m sure the government knows but it wants to keep it a secret. They must presumably be very very bad and very revealing.”

More than 75 eateries including McDonald’s, Hungry Jack’s and Nando’s have been added to the COVID-19 location list in one state.
The Australian Financial Review's Phil Coorey says the limitations of using hotel quarantine for returning overseas Australians is beginning to be realised in light of India's current COVID-19 crisis. 'I think it's getting to the point now, this expectation that the world was going to break the back of this thing is no longer the case, international arrivals are going to be a problem I'd suspect at least this year and beyond,' he said. 'I think it's time we have to start looking seriously and quickly at big facility away from capital cities, especially for hard cases like this Indian situation.'

More than 75 food businesses in Perth were visited by COVID-affected delivery drivers over a period of two days.
McDonald’s, Hungry Jack’s, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, Subway, Chicken Treat, The Coffee Club and KFC were among the popular eateries listed by the Health Department.
“There are about 100 different locations that WA Health advised are very low risk,” Premier Mark McGowan told reporters on Monday.
“People to whom food was delivered are required to get tested. They are considered a casual contact.
“If you were in one of the restaurants from which the food was picked up … you are encouraged to get tested.
“If symptoms develop for anyone who has been to any of these locations, they must get tested immediately.”
The delivery drivers were housemates of a quarantine hotel security guard who contracted the US strain of the virus from a returned traveller.

The Australian Financial Review’s Phil Coorey says the limitations of using hotel quarantine for returning overseas Australians is beginning to be realized in light of India’s current COVID-19 crisis. 

“I think it’s getting to the point now, this expectation that the world was going to break the back of this thing is no longer the case, international arrivals are going to be a problem I’d suspect at least this year and beyond,” he said.

“I think it’s time we have to start looking seriously and quickly at big facility away from capital cities, especially for hard cases like this Indian situation.”

Financial support from cricket continues to help the COVID-19 crisis as big names defend the continuation of the Indian Premier League.
IPL: After being dumped as captain and dropped from the team, David Warner has watched on as 12th man as the Sunrisers Hyderabad were crushed by the Rajasthan Royals.

Australian cricket’s donations to the Indian COVID-19 crisis have topped $150,000 after Cricket Australia pledged $50,000 to help the “distressing” situation on the subcontinent.
It comes after star fast bowler Pat Cummins donated $50,000 from his own pocket and Test great Brett Lee pledged one Bitcoin, worth roughly $55,000, to help the dire situation.
Interim CA boss Nick Hockley said the governing body’s contribution, in conjunction with the Australian Cricketers Association, was hopefully the start of a bigger contribution.
“Australians and Indians share a special bond and, for many, our mutual love of cricket is central to that friendship,” Hockley said.
“It has been distressing and saddening to learn of the suffering of so many of our Indian sisters and brothers during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, and our hearts go out to everyone impacted.
“We were all deeply moved by the sentiments expressed and donations given by Pat Cummins and Brett Lee over the past week.
Brilliant work @BrettLee_58 👏🏼#WeAreInThisTogetherhttps://t.co/6sY6tiCzyE
“In that same spirit, we are proud to partner with UNICEF Australia to raise funds that will help the people of India by providing the health system with much-needed oxygen, testing equipment and vaccines.”
There are still 36 Australian cricketers, coaches and commentators in India for the Indian Premier League, including Test stars Steve Smith and Dave Warner.
Plans for them to return to Australia at the end of the tournament remain up in the air after a travel ban was put in place by the federal government, banning any entries from India until at least May 15.
Former Test opener Michael Slater left India and travelled to the Maldives where he will wait until the ban ends, while Australian players AJ Tye, Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa have already returned home from the IPL
Amid criticism of the IPL continuing while India struggles to cope with coronavirus, national coach Ravi Shastri defended the tournament and said it was the “best thing happening”.
“The IPL is not taking oxygen cylinders from hospitals,” Shastri told SEN’s Gerard Whateley.
“Nor are they asking for any drugs or hospital beds. You must remember everyone in the IPL is in a bubble and are not playing in front of crowds.
“I say to people, ‘Tell me what type of damage it is doing compared to the smile it is putting on people’s faces?’”
The IPL runs until the end of May.

Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19 is ‘red hot’ and will boost the budget bottom line significantly, a leading economist says.
Australia's economic recovery has been branded 'red hot' by a leading economist despite the burden of a predicted $167bn federal budget deficit.

Australia’s budget deficit will be $30bn lower than expected after a “red hot” economic recovery from COVID-19 that is outstripping expectations, one of the nation’s economists says.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will hand down the May 11 budget against a rosier-than-expected backdrop, with the budget boosted by unemployment recoveries and soaring iron ore prices.
Budget deficits will be nearly $100bn lower over the next four years than first predicted, Deloitte Access Economics’ Chris Richardson wrote in his half-yearly budget monitor.
“If our economy gets better, our budget will too. So it’s no surprise that our red-hot recovery is helping the budget get better,” he said.
“To be clear, the economy remains under a lot of pressure, but that pressure is much less than the official forecasts had factored in.”
The budget deficit in 2021-22 would be $30bn lower than Treasury estimates, Deloitte predicted.
“That drives beautiful momentum across all the key drivers of the tax take – jobs, profits and spending,” he said.
Mr Richardson said jobs were returning at a faster rate than first expected at the beginning of the pandemic.

Better-than-expected unemployment figures would add $17bn to the 2020-21 budget bottom line and then a further $3bn in 2021-22.
“That’s even more central to the economic outlook than usual because COVID’s economic pain has centred on jobs,” he said.
Mr Frydenberg last week announced the government would not undertake budget repair until the unemployment rate had dropped below 5 per cent, rather than 6 per cent as previously stated.
Mr Richardson described the new goal as the “fastest and smartest” way to repair the budget, warning going too early would risk harm to the economy.
The recovery is also underpinned by soaring iron ore prices and high export prices.
Fewer businesses going under also meant Australia would “dodge the bullet” of “gigantic hangovers for the tax take”, Mr Richardson said.
But Labor Treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers claimed the strong recovery had “nothing to do” with the federal government and was underpinned by things outside the federal government’s control.
“We’re talking about the difficult decisions taken by state governments to keep people safe, and we’re talking about extraordinary prices that we’re getting for our commodities,” he said.

Records are tumbling day after day as the World Health Organisation reveals the gravity of the global struggle to combat COVID-19.
India has passed a grim new milestone in its fight against COVID as the country recorded over 400,000 cases in a day.

The pictures tell one side of the world’s struggle against COVID-19, with images of patients dying outside hospitals, and crematoriums and graveyards full, with no more room for the dead.
The statistics tell an equally sobering story, more than 16 months on from the first case of coronavirus.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there were as many new infections of COVID-19 globally last week as there were during the entire first five months of the pandemic.
For nine weeks in a row, the number of cases worldwide has reached a new high and for six weeks in a row the number of deaths has eclipsed the week prior.
Second, third and fourth waves of the virus in countries like India, Brazil and Iran are contributing heavily towards those grim figures. India in particular has seen its healthcare system collapse under the weight of infections as patients are turned away from hospitals because of oxygen shortages.
But as the world watches on and help flows to countries most in need, there are a number of new hotspots worth paying attention to including Canada, Sri Lanka and Turkey.

Toronto hospital ‘overwhelmed’ by new infections
An intensive care nurse at a major hospital in Canada said she and her colleagues feel powerless against a tidal wave of new cases.
In Ontario – a province of 14 million of which Toronto is the capital – there were more than 2200 patients who needed to be hospitalised last week and almost 900 of those were listed as “critical”.
The surge in cases has left ICU nurse Farial Faquiry struggling physically and finding it difficult to understand the government’s slow response.
“We’re overwhelmed,” she told AFP, admitting she was angry at times at the Ontarians who were not following public health orders to contain the virus.
“We’re stretched thin. We’re tired and exhausted. Just exhausted.”
Ontario is now the epicentre of the outbreak in Canada, led by more virulent variants.
The latest surge in the number of cases was so big that authorities this week dispatched the military and the Red Cross to help care for critical patients.
“It’s the worst wave I’ve ever seen,” head nurse Kimisha Marshall said.
“We have younger patients coming in, sicker and lots more patients coming in.
“We’re short of nurses. We had some nurses that left, but also we have nurses that are getting sick, too,” she said.

Alarm bells ringing in densely populated Sri Lanka
India is not the only South Asian nation where COVID-19 breakouts have caused panic and chaos.
In Sri Lanka daily infections hit a record on Saturday, with authorities imposing further curbs on movement and activities in parts of the island nation.
The sharp rise in cases has prompted authorities to ban public gatherings and lock down several areas from Sunday.
The number of daily infections, which remained at a couple of hundred just before the traditional new year on April 14, has shot up to a record 1699 as of Saturday.
Since the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Sri Lanka has reported 89 virus deaths, bringing the country’s toll to 687.
“We could face an India-type crisis very soon unless we arrest the current trend of infections,” said chief epidemiologist Sudath Samaraweera.
A charity cricket match in Sri Lanka aimed at raising money to help fight the coronavirus pandemic was cancelled on Sunday as a former Test captain tested positive, the country’s governing body for the sport said.
But the country is going ahead with the two-match Test series against Bangladesh without spectators.
The fallout from COVID-19 is also impacting other industries as Sri Lanka declared its biggest economic downturn in 73 years.

Turkey records fourth most infections globally last week
The normally bustling streets of Istanbul have been much quieter this week as Turkey entered its first full lockdown amid measures to prevent the virus spreading.
According to Reuters, Turkey’s 25,980 new cases and 340 new deaths in the last 24 hours contributed towards a global ranking that puts the country fourth based on seven-day averages.
Businesses have been closed and a curfew has been enforced amid the nationwide lockdown announced by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The BBC reports that Turkey did so well during its first wave that it was celebrated as a success story by WHO – only for the wheels to fall off when measures were eased in March.
It now has the highest infection rate in Europe.
Between January 2020 and April 2021, Turkey averaged more than 50,000 new infections per day. That figure puts it at the top for all of Europe, ahead of France with roughly 30,000 and Germany with 22,000.
Mr Erdogan said Turkey needed to lock down until cases dropped to a more manageable rate.
“At a time when Europe is entering a phase of reopening, we need to rapidly cut our case numbers to below 5000 not to be left behind,” he said.
“Otherwise we will inevitably face heavy costs in every area, from tourism to trade and education.”

‘We are living through a nightmare’
As news.com.au reported last week, the situation in Brazil is so dire that graveyards have no room to bury the dead.
The country’s death toll surpassed 400,000 on Thursday. It is just the second country to reach the grim milestone after the United States.
The country’s health ministry reported 3001 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing Brazil’s overall toll to 401,186.
With a population of 212 million, the South American nation also has one of the highest mortality rates in the pandemic, at 189 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants – the worst in the Americas and one of the top 15 worldwide.
Brazil has been devastated by a surge in cases since the start of the year that pushed hospitals to the brink of collapse in many areas.
Although it appears to have passed the peak of the new wave, the number of daily deaths remains staggeringly high, at an average of 2526 a day over the past week, behind only India.
Worldwide, nearby 3.2 million people have died since the virus emerged.
The worst-affected country in terms of deaths is the United States with 576,722, followed by Brazil with 406,437, Mexico with 217,168, India with 215,542 and the UK with 127,524.

A ‘working theory’ has gone some way to explain how an Australian quarantine hotel security guard contracted the US strain of COVID-19.
Australians over 50 wanting to receive the COVID-19 jab at a GP clinic will have to wait until May 17 - despite phase 2A of the vaccine rollout being brought forward from today. Anyone aged over 50 will be able to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine from one of multiple mass vaccination hubs around Australia after the National Cabinet last month decided to fast track the phase to use up domestically produced doses. New South Wales residents, however, will be exempt from the change as the state continues to focus on vaccinating vulnerable population groups.

A quarantine hotel security guard who contracted COVID-19 did not pick up the virus as a result of poor ventilation, according to the West Australian health minister.
The “working theory” is that the virus spread from a US traveller to another traveller from Indonesia and the security guard.
Health Minister Roger Cook told reporters on Monday that the traveller from Indonesia was on the same floor at the Pan Pacific Hotel as the person from the US and they arrived in Perth on the same day.
“Security guards are kept away from the doors of any rooms where we know we have positive travellers, but in this particular case the security guard was required to be in the proximity of the lift,” Mr Cook said.
He said it was possible the virus was transferred that way, but stressed it was not a ventilation issue, adding that had been ruled out as a possibility by authorities.
“We believe that both the traveller from Indonesia and US were infectious when they went into the hotel so there’s some other movement which actually led to it,” he said.

Asked if it was possible the virus was transferred on the bus ride to the hotel, Mr Cook said that was a potential theory.
“But we’re really just making sure that we look at all the CCTV footage that we have, as well as the epidemiological evidence that we have, to get a better understanding,” he said.
Premier Mark McGowan said the travellers were on the same flight to Perth, so the virus might have spread on the plane.
Three new cases of COVID-19 were recorded in hotel quarantine overnight, but there were no new local transmissions in the state.

Western Australia narrowly avoided another lockdown after the hotel security guard and two of his housemates contracted the virus.
Authorities have identified 58 close contacts, of which 26 have so far tested negative. Seventeen contacts came from a cooking class.
Of the 217 casual contacts, 43 have so far tested negative.
Mr McGowan said a separate list of locations would be added to the public exposure locations list, relating to venues where two infected food delivery drivers picked up and dropped off food.
There are about 100 locations that are considered very low risk and people who had food delivered to them must get tested.
People who were at the restaurants are also encouraged to get tested.
Mr McGowan said the current restrictions were expected to expire on Friday night, but the situation would be reviewed throughout the week.

Meanwhile, Mr McGowan, 53, and Mr Cook, 55, have received the Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
The coronavirus jab is now available for everyone over the age of 50.
Mr McGowan previously said he would not jump ahead of the queue to get the vaccine and would instead wait until he was eligible.
Asked how he was feeling after the needle went in, Mr McGowan joked: “Has she done it yet?”
The Premier said he “didn’t feel a thing”.
He later told reporters it “wasn’t a difficult experience” and urged people to get the jab.

People can get the jab at the state-run community vaccination clinics or wait until May 17 to get it at their GP clinic.
The state-run metropolitan community clinics are located at the Claremont Showgrounds, Kwinana Supa Centre and near Perth Airport at 2 George Wiencke Drive.
A fourth community vaccination clinic is scheduled to open later this month in Joondalup.
In regional Western Australia, hospital-based vaccination clinics are offering vaccinations in the Goldfields, Great Southern, Kimberley, Mid West, Pilbara, South West and Wheatbelt regions in addition to some local GP clinics.

Those aged over 50 are now eligible to get the AstraZeneca vaccine but many are worried about whether it’s safe. This is what we know.
Vaccine blood clotting cause still ‘unknown’ but understanding the risk is simple.

From today, Australians aged 50 or older are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine but many are worried about getting the jab.
More than two million vaccine doses have already been given in Australia so far but concerns have been raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine in recent weeks due to rare cases of life-threatening blood clots.
A recent Guardian Essential poll found willingness to get vaccinated had dropped from 60 to 55 per cent among those aged over 50, and about 39 per cent said they didn’t want to take the AstraZeneca jab.
Health authorities and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose mother has been vaccinated with AstraZeneca, have said the vaccine is safe and the benefits outweigh the risks for those aged over 50.
“The risk benefit for over-50s is vastly in favour of being vaccinated,” Health Department secretary Professor Brendan Murphy told reporters on April 22.
Over-50s will be able to get vaccinated through GP respiratory clinics and state and territory vaccination sites from today, with normal GP clinics able to offer the jab from May 17.
In a piece for The Conversation, three experts including Australian National University epidemiologist Meru Sheel outlined how safe and effective the vaccine is, using clinical trial data and information from around 136 countries using the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Is the AstraZeneca vaccine safe?
The experts note that clinical trial as well as real-world data show that the AstraZeneca has a “good safety profile” that is similar to other vaccines used in Australia.
There are some common side effects but these are mostly mild to moderate including reactions at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.
About 22 per cent of people missed a day or more of work or studies due to feeling unwell but less than 2 per cent needed to see a doctor.

How likely are you to get blood clots?
The experts note that reactions to the AstraZeneca vaccine have been very rare and this includes thrombocytopenia syndrome, which is when blood clots and low levels of platelets occur between four and 28 days after the jab. About 20 to 25 per cent of people who develop these clots die.
However, only six people in every million who get the jab develop the condition. It tends to be more common in people under 50.
“In Australia, there have been six cases of this type of blood clotting: one person in their 30s, four in their 40s, and one in their 80s. Of these, a person in their 40s has died from it,” the article notes.

Looking at the small amount of data available so far gained from Victoria’s second wave in July 2020, Australians are 10 times more likely to get severely ill or hospitalised from getting COVID-19, than to get a blood clot from the vaccine.
The risk of blood clots for people aged 50-59 years old is about 0.4 per 100,000. For those aged between 60-69, it is 0.2 per 100,000.
However, the risk of getting severely ill from the coronavirus, or of being hospitalised in intensive care, is much higher.
For those aged between 50-59, the risk is about 6.5 per 100,000 (compared to 0.4 per 100,000 for blood clots). For those aged 60-69, it is 7 per 100,000 (compared to 0.2 per 100,000 for blood clots).

Clinical trials found there were 81 per cent fewer COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated ones.
“No one who got the vaccine was hospitalised due to COVID-19,” the article notes.
The authors say it is safe to assume the vaccine is at least 80 per cent effective in preventing severe COVID-19 in people aged over 50.
It is also about 70 per cent effective against the B.1.1.7 strain (the more easily spread UK variant).
But we don’t have any outbreaks
While Australia has almost no cases of COVID-19 at the moment, the experts note this could change very quickly if there are new outbreaks.
There is no alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine for most people over 50 as more shipments of the Pfizer vaccine will not be available until the last quarter of this year.
“So balancing the risks and benefits of the vaccine, is extremely challenging,” the authors note.
“People may not perceive their risk of COVID-19 as high enough to warrant vaccination and are preferring to wait, perhaps six months or more until other vaccines are available.
“However, the potential benefits of the vaccine go far beyond what we’ve already mentioned.
“Vaccination will contribute to the prevention of long COVID-19 (symptoms that linger for months) as well as increased ability to move around freely in society, including being able to attend large events.
“Vaccination will help us avoid lockdowns or school closures, allow us to travel overseas and return to normal life.”
Deakin University epidemiologist Professor Catherine Bennett told ABC she thought people would relax about getting the vaccine once others they knew had got it.
“I think as more people take up the vaccine, I think other people will then think, ‘Yeah, look, there are a lot of benefits from this. My friends are fine. I’m OK with this.’
“So, I think progressively with time people will start to relax more and will probably stop chasing every single case that might or might not be related to some sort of reaction.”

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud says beef has been at the forefront of Australia’s economic recovery from the COVID-19.

Speaking from Beef Week in Rockhampton Mr Littleproud said more than 100,000 people will attend the event.

“We are one of the biggest beef exporting nations in the world, in fact number two, and out beef producers have had a pretty tough time over the last three years,” Mr Littleproud told Sky News.

“But the industry’s on its way up, it’s a $15 billion industry and without our economy would have been buggered during COVID-19.

“Resources and agriculture has lifted us out of this recession.”

Almost a third of the country is now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine – but the availability will depend on where you live.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?

Eight million Australians are now eligible to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine as the federal government ramps up the rollout of national immunisation against COVID-19.
Australians aged over 50 have been brought forward in the government’s vaccine timeline as part of phase 2a.
From Monday, over 50s can get the jab at commonwealth-run respiratory clinics and state and territory-run vaccination centres, which are the first to offer AstraZeneca vaccines under phase 2a.
From May 17, over 50s will be able to receive the AstraZeneca at participating general practitioners (GPs).
Phase 2a includes adults over 50, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults aged between 18-49 and “other critical and high-risk workers”.
Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said concerns over rare blood clotting from the AstraZeneca jab for under 50s had freed up a large number of doses for over 50s.
That led to national cabinet’s April 22 decision to move forward phase 2a.
“Clearly, we have to encourage Australians to get vaccinated; we have to make sure that we have a program that is credible,” he said last month.
“The AstraZeneca vaccine is the vaccine for people 50 years and over. Because the states and territories will be no longer providing AstraZeneca to under 50s in their clinics, that will free up more AstraZeneca to go to primary care sites.”

While approximately eight million Australians over 50 are eligible, receiving the AstraZeneca jab may depend on what state you live in.
Victorians can book an appointment at one of the state-run centres or walk into one but that will require a wait. They can also phone 1800 675 398 to make an appointment.
However, New South Wales health officials have said they will focus on priority groups at state-run centres from May 3.
NSW’s capacity will rise significantly once its mass vaccination centre opens at Sydney Olympic Park in mid-May.
Only those at risk will be offered an appointment, and the vaccine will not be available to all residents aged over 50 in the state-run centres.
To find out if and when you can receive a vaccine, use the federal government’s eligibility tracker.
Also beginning on Monday, state-run facilities whose refrigeration capacity qualifies to store the Pfizer vaccine will be able to offer it to Australians aged under 50 who are eligible in phases 1a and 1b.
The changes from Monday leaves the remainder of phases 2a, 2b and 3 waiting to receive the Pfizer jab.
Phase 2b includes the rest of the population aged between 16-49.

The state’s top doctor has called for a major overhaul of the hotel quarantine system and labelled the India ban as ‘un-Australian’.
India's coronavirus death toll has climbed to a grim new record after 3,689 fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours. The nation also saw another day of almost 400,000 new infections amid the escalating crisis. One more state has been forced into lockdown, but the Indian government remains reluctant to enforce nationwide measures. The country has expanded its vaccination program to all adults and frozen exports, but many states continue to struggle with shortages. A lack of vaccines, medical supplies and hospital beds is restricting the effectiveness of containment efforts. More international aid arrived yesterday alleviating the dire oxygen shortage. France sent eight generator plants and 28 ventilators and the UK government has also stepped up its response to the crisis.

Western Australia’s top doctor has taken aim at the state’s “hopeless” quarantine system after a security guard contracted COVID-19 and inadvertently infected two of his housemates, including a delivery driver.
Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller said he did not have confidence in the system and has also labelled the federal government’s move to deny stranded Australians the right to return home from India as “absolutely unacceptable”.
Contact tracers are yet to reveal how the worker contracted the virus, but so far Perth has avoided another snap lockdown. Dr Miller said it was time for an overhaul of the state’s system.

“We have shown it travels down hallways a lot further than 1.5m, and surgical masks are inadequate for workers and guests who might be near people who are COVID positive,” he told the Today show.
“We have to be thinking about the future and how we can prevent airborne disease spreading around as easily as it does now.
“We only have 30 positive cases in our system out of 2100, and that has been enough to cause the whole thing to shut down, and we can’t have people coming back from India which is a complete disgrace.
It is not a quarantine system. It is a hopeless system.”

When asked whether he agreed with Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the system was “overworked” and needed a rest, Dr Miller said a true quarantine system “should be able to have thousands of people with the disease (in it) and it not be a problem”.
“If you can’t run a system where less than 2 per cent of your people have COVID and still keep it out of the community, it is not quarantine,” he said.
Dr Miller said the system was also failing Australians stranded in India after the federal government introduced new legislation on the weekend that could fine or jail people should they come back within the next two weeks.
“I think once people see beyond their own fear of the disease, they will understand that these are the people who are suffering because we haven’t got our act together on quarantine or vaccine in this country,” he said.
“They are the ones paying the price for us now … our fellow Australians who have been trapped overseas for quite some time.
“We have to look after our own. It is not Australian to trap people overseas. It is absolutely unacceptable and outrageous.”
Dr Miller said he wanted to apologise to Indian-Australians that “those of us who have a voice in this were not able to stop that particular decision from happening”.
“I’m really sorry,” he added.

Australians over 50 wanting to receive the COVID-19 jab at a GP clinic will have to wait until May 17 – despite phase 2A of the vaccine rollout being brought forward from today. 

Anyone aged over 50 will be able to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine from one of multiple mass vaccination hubs around Australia after the National Cabinet last month decided to fast track the phase to use up domestically produced doses. 

New South Wales residents, however, will be exempt from the change as the state continues to focus on vaccinating vulnerable population groups.

Coronavirus restrictions have been tightened in Perth as Premier Mark McGowan seeks to avoid another lockdown.

No new COVID-19 infections have been recorded and all high-risk close contacts of the three positive cases announced on Saturday have tested negative.

Perth nightclubs have been ordered to close immediately and spectators were banned from yesterday's AFL local derby.

Mr McGowan said he did not want to impose another lockdown but warned he would if the health advice suggested it was the best way forward.

Meanwhile, the travel bubble between New Zealand and Western Australia has been reinstated after it was paused due to the three positive cases in WA.

From today all Australians over the age of 50 are eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19 kicking off phase 2A of the rollout.

Vaccination clinics across the country will be open to Australians in the relevant age group except in New South Wales where clinics will continue to focus on the previous priority groups.

National Cabinet agreed last month to bring forward this next phase of the rollout - to make use of the locally-produced AstraZeneca stock.

Covid-19 cases and deaths per day in India as of May 2.
Germany is among the nations that have rushed Covid-19 aid to IndiaSource:AFP
International aid to alleviate India's dire oxygen shortage arrived in the South Asian nation on Sunday, as its coronavirus death toll climbed to a grim new record.
The country of 1.3 billion reported 3,689 coronavirus deaths on Sunday -- another grim daily record, with nearly 400,000 new cases of Covid-19 registered across India.
India expanded its vaccination programme to all adults on Saturday, but many of its states are struggling with shortages despite an export freeze for shots produced domestically.
"People are sometimes dying in front of the hospitals. They have no more oxygen. Sometimes (they are dying) in their cars," said Germany's ambassador to India, Walter J. Lindner, as 120 ventilators arrived late Saturday.
Social media platforms have been flooded with pleas from people looking for oxygen cylinders, medicines and hospital beds as the Covid-19 wave causes widespread shortages.
Aid from France reached India on Sunday, including eight oxygen generator plants and 28 ventilators, adding to the ventilators from Germany that arrived the previous night.
A group of British doctors also staged their own intervention by offering long-distance telemedicine from Britain to take the pressure off their Indian colleagues and allow them to concentrate on Covid patients.
Anthony Fauci, the top US pandemic advisor, said in comments published Saturday that the whole of India should go into lockdown to fight this wave.
A growing list of countries have cut flights from India, with Nigeria on Sunday banning entry to all travellers who have been in the country in the last two weeks, though Nigerians and those transiting in India will be exempt.
In Sri Lanka daily infections hit a record on Saturday, with authorities imposing further curbs on movement and activities in parts of the island nation.
- 'We're tired and exhausted' -
Brazil, the worst-hit Latin American nation, has crossed 400,000 Covid-19 deaths -- second only to the United States -- with many of its hospitals pushed to the brink of collapse.
Ontario's healthcare system is near breaking point, said intensive care nurse Farial Faquiry at Toronto's Humber River Hospital.
"We're tired and exhausted. Just exhausted."
Although the Covid-19 threat remains in sharp focus in crisis spots around the world, some countries continue to make progress in dealing with the pandemic.
And South Africa, the worst-hit nation on the African continent said it was due to take delivery of the first batch of its 4.5 million Pfizer vaccines.
Anti-restriction protesters gathered in several European countries on Saturday, including Finland, Sweden, Belgium and Germany.
One partygoer was knocked out by a water cannon and 14 others were slightly injured -- including one struck by a police horse -- as riot police brutally dispersed the party on Saturday in scenes echoing a similar gathering in the park a month before.

One of the country’s top doctors has lashed out at Premier Mark McGowan’s claim there was “no clear explanation” for how a hotel guard got COVID.
Western Australia’s recent outbreaks were “all preventable” but Premier Mark McGowan was “dodging some of the responsibility,” according to Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid. Three new cases of COVID-19 confirmed over the weekend were hotel quarantine workers who had spent time in the community following their infection. It came after the premier plunged the Perth and Peel regions into a snap three-day lockdown over one case confirmed over the Anzac Day weekend. Dr Khorshid said what was already known about the virus and how to run hotel quarantine meant the outbreaks were all preventable. “WA seems to think when things go wrong, they don’t need to make changes; that’s a very disappointing attitude,” he said. Dr Khorshid said the recent outbreaks coming out of hotel quarantine clearly showed there needed to be a national conversation about the future of quarantine. “We’re going to need it for years, and now is the time to start building the appropriate facilities around the country,” he said. “The federal government doesn’t seem interested at this stage. I hope the Western Australian government doesn’t feel it’s off the hook just by pointing the finger at the federal government. “There is no doubt that there is only one government responsible for the lockdown we just had in Perth and the ongoing restrictions.”

Western Australia’s top doctor has blasted the state government’s apparent confusion around how a hotel quarantine guard became infected with COVID-19 before infecting two of his housemates.
Premier Mark McGowan said Western Australia would avoid another lockdown but some restrictions would remain in light of this weekend’s three new cases, which have prompted some states to update travel advice for Western Australia.
The guard had worked at Perth’s Pan Pacific Hotel on April 24, 25 and 26, at a time new arrivals were admitted to the hotel, and worked on the same floor as two returned travellers who had tested positive.
“CCTV vision is being reviewed, however there is no clear explanation at this point as to how the security guard could have been infected,” Mr McGowan said on Sunday.

“It is possible transmission could have occurred while the international arrivals were admitted into hotel quarantine and possibly were transferred to their rooms. This is being investigated further.”
But Australian Medical Association WA President Andrew Miller said there was no mystery around the transmission, and accused the state government of ignoring advice that the virus was airborne and hotel ventilation was a problem.
Dr Miller pointed to the findings of an independent review into hotel quarantine in WA that identified airborne transmission and poor ventilation as the most significant risk factor for the transmission of the virus in hotel quarantine.
The findings of the review promoted an assessment of ventilation in Perth’s nine quarantine hotels.

“The infection of the guard (again) in HQ (again) in WA (again) isn’t inexplicable, Premier,” Dr Miller tweeted after Mr McGowan’s press conference on Sunday.
“The govt’s own report makes it clear that airborne spread is happening.
“Using budget PPE (personal protection equipment) while not shifting 30 positive cases to air gapped quarantine is crazy.”
Dr Miller, who has repeatedly called for an overhaul of WA’s hotel quarantine system, described it as an “an expensive abusive joke stopping suffering Aussies from getting home, from India & elsewhere”.
“Remove the positive cases to dongas next week,” he said, referring to temporary or demountable housing. “Use N95 PPE.”

Earlier this week, Dr Miller told ABC’s RN Breakfast the state should immediately move to a model that used N95 masks and negative pressure rooms — which is being adopted in Victoria — and build purpose-built quarantine camps for returned travellers.
Negative pressure rooms use air pressure that’s lower than outside the room, which stops contaminated air from escaping when the door is opened.
“The hotels have never been fit for purpose and we’ve been saying that from the start,” Dr Miller told RN Breakfast’s Fran Kelly.
“The problem is the Infection Control Expert Group federally, who continue to deny the airborne spread problem and that people need N95 masks and negative pressure rooms in hotel quarantine.
“Victoria seems to be getting the message and moving ahead but until we move to air-gapped facilities and accept that airborne COVID is going to be a problem everywhere … this is going to continue to happen in all the hotels.”
Border changes after WA’s new cases
States and territories have new advice for travellers in light of Perth’s new cases but New Zealand said flights to and from the city would be allowed to resume.
Travel between New Zealand and Western Australia was halted after last week’s snap lockdown in Perth and Peel but health officials in New Zealand said travel could restart as the new infections did not appear to be a risk to the public.
However, anyone who had been to any venues on the updated list of public exposure sites in WA will not be allowed into New Zealand within 14 days of exposure.
Meanwhile, NSW Health sent screening teams to Sydney Airport on Sunday to greet arrivals from Perth as it contact those who have arrived from Perth since April 27.
Anyone currently in NSW who has been in Perth since Tuesday 27 April should immediately check if they have been in a place of high concern. If you have attended any of these venues at the relevant times, please immediately isolate, get tested, and call NSW Health on 1800 943 553.
The department said anyone who had arrived in NSW from Perth since April 27 and had been to any of those locations must self-isolate immediately.
Queensland said arrivals to the state who had been to those locations must go into quarantine.
“If you are entering Queensland and have been to any of the WA exposure sites at the time specified, you will need to quarantine for 14 days in government-arranged accommodation,” Queensland’s Deputy chief health officer Sonya Bennett said.
“If you have been to any of these sites and are already in Queensland, you must call 13 HEALTH to discuss your circumstances.

“You must immediately travel by private transport directly to your home or accommodation and quarantine until you receive further instructions from Queensland Health.
“This direction is in place to protect the health and safety of Queenslanders and travellers who come here.”
The Australian Capital Territory has new measures for arrivals from Perth as it warns Canberrans against travelling to Western Australia.
Arrivals in the ACT have to declare if they have been in Perth or the Peel region in the 14 days prior to arrival, as well as those who had been in those regions since April 27.

A COVID-19 test almost kept gun forward Harry McKay out of Carlton’s win over Essendon at the MCG on Sunday afternoon.

After waking up with a “24-hour bug” on Sunday, Harry McKay had to pass a COVID-19 test in time to play a key role in Carlton’s impressive comeback victory over Essendon at the MCG.
The young key forward had a quiet first half, but finished with a wet sail as he banged home four goals in the second to help the Blues execute a 37-point turnaround.
“I think it’s just a bit of gastro, nothing too bad,” Carlton coach David Teague said.
“He just woke up and he wasn’t feeling great and we had the conversation and he said, ‘Nah, I think I can get the job done for the team to a level we need’, and obviously he’s been in great form.
“He hit the scoreboard, gave us a contest and he’s a very hard man to defend because of his speed and height.
“I was super proud of Harry’s game … didn’t complain, didn’t tell any of his teammates, just went out there and kept competing.”
But the Blues didn’t escape the match unscathed with Mitch McGovern injuring his hamstring late and Paddy Dow having to be subbed out due to an eye injury which severely impaired his vision.
“I went up to him and he just shook his head, so he’s pretty disappointed,” Teague said of McGovern, who will likely miss multiple weeks.
It’s unclear as to whether Dow will be fit to face the Western Bulldogs next week, but Zac Williams (soreness) and Marc Murphy (neck) are good chances to return.

Carlton dasher Adam Saad was roundly booed all game by Essendon supporters in his first game against his old side, and the sound was music to Teague’s ears.
“I loved the boos because they were quite regular so it meant he was getting the ball a bit,” Teague said of Saad, who was one of Carlton’s best players.
Blues captain Patrick Cripps wasn’t overly influential in the first three quarters, but saved his best for last with a superb final term.
“At three-quarter time … he looked at me and said, ‘I’ve got this’, and when your leader does that, the way he played the last quarter (was great) and he’s a very important player to us,” Teague said.
After being jumped by the Bombers in the first 45 minutes to trail by 21 points, Teague said the Blues were able to change things up simply by defending better and subsequently becoming more potent in their attacking half.
Carlton won’t have to wait long to test their wares against the AFL’s best teams again. After being beaten by Richmond, Port Adelaide and the Brisbane Lions already in the first six weeks, they have the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne to look forward to over the next fortnight.
“We love those games and we want to play in those games,” Teague said.
“I think we’ve played three of the top four from last year and we haven’t got the job done so that’s our next step as a group.
“From a defensive point of view to beat these teams you can’t give them too many looks and we’ve got to get better.
“But I’m really confident if we play near our best … we can beat the Bulldogs or beat Melbourne.
“Our best is good enough to beat anyone, the challenge is going out there and executing under pressure.”

Sky News host Chris Smith says Mark McGowan’s Anzac Day weekend lockdown over one case is his “finest fiasco,” but doing a U-turn after three cases this weekend shows the premier is “making it up”.

Premier McGowan plunged the Perth and Peel regions into a snap three-day lockdown on the Anzac Day weekend after a returning Australian tested positive after leaving hotel quarantine.

The premier, though, did not have the same reaction to three-cases of COVID-19 in the community confirmed on Friday.

“Despite having three positive cases ... he did a U-turn - No lockdown, carry on as you were,” Mr Smith said.

“He's making it up, and obviously not taking the medical advice, he claims to be following.

“Acting out of fear, and making crazy decisions to lockdown, because he's got no confidence in his health system, is a heartless, dictatorial way to run a state.”

Victoria will ramp up its rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine this week with those aged over 50 able to walk in to get the jab, and more hubs opening across the state.

Every Victorian over the age of 50 will be able to get a COVID-19 jab from Monday as the state government opens a raft of vaccination hubs to support its six high-volume centres.
The AstraZeneca vaccine rollout for over-50s will be ramped up this week with a seventh high-volume vaccination centre opening on Tuesday at the Cranbourne Turf Club.
That will bolster the existing group of walk-in centres – the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, the former Ford Factory, the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Sunshine Hospital and Mercure Ballarat.
The government will also open 15 vaccination centres at sites across the state from Monday, including at both city and country hospitals , bringing the total number of vaccine hubs in Victoria to 22.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said more vaccination centres would be unveiled in coming weeks.
“The best thing we can all do to support Victoria’s recovery from COVID-19 is to take the opportunity to be vaccinated as soon as we can – and the Victorian government is making it easier to do just that,” he said.
“We’ve worked hard to have 22 sites open to the eligible public by Monday, and there’ll be more to come.
“Initially, we are asking Victorians to phone up and book if you aren’t headed to a high-volume vaccination centre.
“We’re proud to work with GPs to support the commonwealth’s vaccination program any way we can.”

Several of the open access centres will also offer a pathway to the Pfizer vaccine for those eligible.
The Pfizer vaccine supply is limited and prioritised for eligible people under the age of 50 in the phase 1a and 1b of the commonwealth’s vaccination program.
Epidemiologist Hassan Vally, from Latrobe University, said if those eligible for the AstraZeneca had concerns about the risk of “extremely rare” blood clotting, they should discuss it with their doctor.
“All questions regarding how the vaccine may impact on your health should involve a discussion with your GP,” she said.
“It needs to be understood that since there are so few cases of this clotting disorder, we do not have a complete understanding of it and what the risk factors are.”
VACCINATION CENTRES OPEN TO THE ELIGIBLE PUBLIC FROM MONDAY:
• Bendigo Hospital

Premier Mark McGowan says he wants to avoid going into lockdowns again but has not ruled them out, as he bans crowds from Sunday’s Western Derby at Optus Stadium.

This comes after no new cases of COVID-19 but the premier warned the state is not out of the woods yet.

Mr McGowan also announced nightclubs will be closed immediately.

“I want to avoid going into lockdown again. I know how much it can impact people's lives and businesses but if we need to go back into lockdown we will,” he said.

“We have to clampdown on COVID-19 so we can return to normal business more quickly so, based on the additional information that has now come to light, we have made the decision to not permit spectators attend the Derby this afternoon. There will be no crowd at this event at Optus Stadium this afternoon. 

“Having 45,000 people try to get to Optus Stadium at the same time is too much of a risk, especially as we are still going through the close contacts. 

“In addition to the crowd decision, nightclubs will be closed immediately add we will keep monitoring the situation. We are not out of the woods just yet.”

It’s an incumbent year and people love their premiers good, bad or ugly according to Sky News host James Morrow.

Tasmania Premier Peter Gutwein overnight claimed victory in the state’s election, following the trend of elections in the age of COVID-19.

“Just look at Dan Andrews’ ratings, just look at Mark McGowan,” Mr Morrow said.

"A premier that would keep his job in Tasmania or anywhere in Australia right now shouldn’t be too much of a surprise.”

A Coles store and a cinema are among several new venues added to a growing list of COVID-19 exposure sites after another outbreak in Perth.
New Zealand has immediately paused its Trans-Tasman travel bubble with Western Australia after three new COVID-19 cases were confirmed. A Perth hotel quarantine security guard and two of his housemates have tested positive to the virus. The man in his 20's became infected while working at Perth's Pan Pacific Hotel from April 24 to 26 and attended a number of locations while potentially contagious from April 27. A flight from Perth due to land in Auckland today has reportedly been cancelled and anyone who has arrived in New Zealand from Perth in the past four days is advised to check the WA government website. Premier Mark McGowan said there while there is no clear explanation for how the original man became infected, he was not planning on implementing another lockdown at present.

﻿Western Australia health officials have flagged a Coles and Event Cinemas among new public exposure sites after a Perth security guard contracted COVID-19 in hotel quarantine and spread the virus to two of his friends.
The man, aged in his 20s, tested positive to COVID-19, with two of seven people sharing the man’s house also returning positive results.
The guard had worked in the Pan Pacific Hotel on April 24, 25 and 26, on the same floor as two hotel quarantine residents who had tested positive to coronavirus.
Since then, WA Health have announced a number of new sites the Perth security guard and the two others visited while infectious.
Anyone who was at following locations during the specified times must get a COVID test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.

Mark McGowan has snapped in a tense exchange, while also hitting out at NSW, as he revealed Perth had narrowly avoided another lockdown.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.

Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan has fired up over being compared to New South Wales in his decision to avoid a drastic lockdown for Perth due to several cases of COVID-19.
On Saturday, a hotel quarantine security guard – and then two of his seven housemates – tested positive to COVID-19 in Perth.
But on Sunday, Mr McGowan said a lockdown was not necessary despite suggesting it could happen if the situation worsened.
No new local transmissions of the virus were recorded overnight in Perth despite it being revealed the guard’s housemates who tested positive were food delivery drivers.
Perth had only just emerged from a snap lockdown on Monday, which was triggered after a man spent up to five days in the community while infectious with COVID-19 following a stay in hotel quarantine.
However, Mr McGowan was furious when asked by a reporter if he was taking a more relaxed strategy this time.
A reporter at Sunday’s press conference suggested it was reminiscent of NSW counterpart Gladys Berejiklian and her measured approach to containing COVID-19.

“I have explained it now three times and I will explain it again,” Mr McGowan hit back.
“Last week, we were already in the state of semi-lockdown.
“People (in Perth were) wearing masks, we had rules and various venues closed, and then coincidentally this (Saturday’s) case emerged while all those rules were in place.
“Had these three cases emerged two or three weeks ago, we would have gone into lockdown.
“You have to judge everything in the circumstances you confront.
“There is no hard and fast rule and every state has, I think, adopted a pretty precautionary approach by world standards.”
Mr McGowan then lashed out at the NSW government, claiming the outbreak that occurred on Sydney’s northern beaches in December was far more devastating economically than the recent lockdown in Perth.
“NSW, when they had the Northern Beaches outbreak, they shut down the northern beaches for weeks, which has a population of 500,000 or the best part of 1 million people, and parts of country NSW,” he said.
“Then they had rolling lockdowns and various restrictions in place for the best part of three months. It ended up costing the NSW economy, according to the NSW Treasury, $3.2 billion.
“(It was way higher than) the estimate of the cost of what happened as a consequence of the Mercure outbreak in Perth (last month). So they have their approach, we adopted ours.”
Mr McGowan also announced no fans would be allowed at Perth’s scheduled AFL blockbuster clash between local clubs Fremantle and West Coast, which was tipped to welcome 45,000 people into Optus Stadium.

After a horror week of rising coronavirus infections and deaths, India has become the first country to reach a devastating new record.
A record day of COVID-19 cases have seen India reach a grim milestone, with the country topping 18 million.

After 10 consecutive days of more than 300,000 cases every 24 hours, India has reached a devastating new record amid its second COVID-19 wave.
As medical supplies dwindle and the death toll continues to rise, authorities in the nation of 1.3 billion reported 401,993 new coronavirus infections on Saturday – the highest ever daily count globally since the pandemic began. It brings the nation’s total cases to 19,164,969.
Sadly, another 3523 people died from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking the total toll to 211,853, according to federal health ministry data.
“It’s impossibly bad,” Dr Sumit Ray, the medical superintendent at Delhi’s Holy Family Hospital, told the ABC.
“It’s way beyond even what the media is able to capture. Not because they don’t want to. Even doctors don’t realise how bad it is.”

Hospital fire in COVID-19 ward kills 18 people
The total death toll following a fire at the Welfare Hospital in Bharuch, in India’s west, now stands at 18 – 16 of them coronavirus patients and two of them nurses.
It was the third hospital blaze in recent weeks, following an April 23 fire on the outskirts of Mumbai which killed 13 COVID-19 patients. It occurred just days after another fire at a different clinic left 22 people dead.
The cause of the fire on Saturday is under investigation, according to officials.

Delhi lockdown extended by another week
Meanwhile, a lockdown in Delhi, the pandemic’s new “Ground Zero” and home to almost 19 million people, has been extended by another week due to the continued increase in cases.
It’s the second time the lockdown – intended to only last six days – has been prolonged, initially brought into place on April 19. It will now continue until at least May 10.
“The intensity with which the cases are rising made it imperative to impose this lockdown,” Delhi’s Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said in a briefing.
“This was the last resort against the rising cases in Delhi and it had become essential to do it. But the COVID surges refuses to come down.”

RELATED: ‘Serious concerns’ over India travel ban
America’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said that the whole of India should go into a weeks-long lockdown to arrest the current surge of cases and deaths.
It’s a move that’s been resisted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, after a nationwide shutdown during its first wave last year caused widespread human suffering and a painful economic hit.
“I think the most important thing in the immediate is to get oxygen, get supplies, get medication, get PPE, those kinds of things,” Dr Fauci told the Indian Express.
“But also, one of the immediate things to do is essentially call a shutdown of the country. And if you shut down, you don’t have to shut down for six months. You can shut down temporarily to put an end to the cycle of transmission.
“No one likes to lock down the country … But if you do it just for a few weeks, you could have a significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak.”

An image of a sweat-drenched doctor in India has gone viral on social media, serving as a stark reminder of the intense strain health staff are under as the nation grapples with its devastating second COVID-19 wave.
New cases topped 400,000 in the last 24 hours – the highest ever daily count reported globally since the pandemic began – after more than a week of at least 300,000 new infections each day.
The death toll, meanwhile, has now surpassed 211,000, with 3523 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, according to federal health ministry data.
Hospitals and morgues are overflowing as desperate families scour the capital for oxygen and medicine, while a harrowing image of a doctor has reflected the frontline struggle.
Taking to Twitter, Dr Sohil Makwana shared a two images side-by-side – one of him dressed in PPE and the other of him in the clothes he was wearing underneath. Both outfits are soaked in sweat.

Writing that he was “proud to serve the nation”, in a second tweet Dr Makwana shared a message “on the behalf of all doctors and health workers”.
“We are really working hard away from our family,’ he wrote.
“Sometimes a foot away from a positive patient, sometimes an inch away from critically ill oldies … I request please go for a vaccination … it’s (the) only solution! Stay safe.”

The image comes after a photographer at the pandemic’s “Ground Zero” in Delhi revealed the response he gets from the grieving as the country’s death toll spirals out of control.
Asked by the BBC’s India correspondent, Soutik Biswas, whether people had accused of him of creating “death porn” by chronicling the unfolding devastation, the photographer said the opposite was true.
“Grieving relatives of the dead come up and tell me at crematoria: ‘Please shoot. You guys should show to India and the world what is going on’,” he said.
Of the mounting death toll and the disposal of bodies, the photojournalist told Biswas: “Everything is so overwhelming. I haven’t seen so much death and misery. The subjects of your pictures become part of you because they are seeking help. That’s a lot of raw emotion.”

Officials at the New Zealand Ministry of Health have put an immediate pause on flights from Western Australia after new positive COVID-19 cases were recorded in Perth.
A worker in his 20s at a Perth isolation facility tested positive for COVID-19 as part of routine testing this weekend. Two of the man’s housemates have also tested positive.
“Scheduled direct flights from Western Australia to New Zealand should be immediately paused while a further assessment is carried out, including a further assessment and information from Australian health officials,” a Ministry of Health statement said in light of the news.
A flight from Perth due to land in Auckland at 5.50am this morning was stopped in its tracks due to the new information.
WA Premier Mark McGowan said the positive case, a security guard at the Pan Pacific Hotel, had been at work between April 24-26 and previously tested negative for the virus.
He had already received his first dose of the vaccine by the time his result was returned positive.
He was reportedly working on the same floor two positive overseas cases were spending their isolation period.

“On his first day off, Tuesday, 27 April, is the day our health authorities expect he may have become infectious in the community,” Mr McGowan said.
“I understand on this day he dropped friends to their workplace and went to a friend’s house. We understand later that evening he developed symptoms which he thought were related to his COVID Pfizer vaccine.
“On Friday morning he visited a mosque for about 30 minutes and then went to a hotel quarantine facility for his weekly PCR test under the requirement we have in place for hotel quarantine workers. Test results came back and were confirmed to be positive.”
WA officials are currently weighing up whether to enforce another lockdown as contact tracers attempt to locate the cause of the spread. The state enforced strict mask-wearing rules after threats of a new cluster emerged, requiring all citizens in Perth and the neighbouring Peel region to cover up while indoors and on public transport.
“We are effectively in a holding pattern and I hope we can avoid going back into lockdown,” Mr McGowan said.
“What has helped enormously is that, due to the interim restrictions we have had in place since Tuesday, they have significantly reduced movement in the community and everyone has been wearing masks.
“That gives us some confidence that the risk of transmission is significantly lower than it would normally be. These factors and the fact we have picked up this case as early means we can avoid moving into a lockdown at this point. But it is possible this could change by tomorrow or the day after.”

A Liberal majority government is expected in Tasmania after Premier Peter Gutwein delivered a victory speech on Saturday night with his party set to become the first in state history to secure a third term.

Speaking at the iconic Tally Room, following a concession speech from Opposition Leader Rebecca White, Mr Gutwein said it was "time for Tasmania's next chapter".

Ms White attributed the Liberal win to Mr Gutwein’s decisions around keeping the Tasmanian community safe during the coronavirus pandemic.

"All around the country we've seen incumbent government rewarded for their management of COVID-19, and there's no doubt that Peter Gutwein and our public health officials kept our community safe and tonight's result reflects that.

Mr Gutwein congratulated Ms White and Greens Leader Cassey O'Connor for the "hard-fought campaign" stating while they sat in different places on the political spectrum, they were both "dedicated to serving the Tasmanian community".

Officials have added two more potential exposure sites at Brisbane airport visited by a man who tested positive to COVID-19.

The man and his travel partner arrived from high-risk Papua New Guinea and were mistakenly allowed into a 'green zone' where hundreds of passengers were preparing to fly to New Zealand. 

Queensland Health called for anyone who attended Hudson's coffee stand and the adjacent seating area between 9.53AM and 11.20AM or the male toilets next to Gate 79 between 11.23AM and 11.15PM to self-isolate and have a test.

Queensland's COVID check-in app is mandatory for all hospitality venues from today.

The state government believes the tracing app will act as a crucial frontline tool for containing outbreaks. 

More than 2.4 million QLD residents downloaded the app since February and over 18 million check-ins have been recorded. 

It will ease significant pressure on small businesses recording data by paper or through a third-party app.

Opposition Leader Rebecca White has conceded the Tasmanian state election to Peter Gutwein in a graceful speech where she applauded the Premier for his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic but warned him "business as usual" would not be tolerated.

"It is clear tonight we have fallen short of our goal to form a majority Labor government. A short time ago I rang Peter Gutwein to congratulate him on his re-election and his personal impressive result," she said.

"All around the country we've seen incumbent government rewarded for their management of COVID-19, and there's no doubt that Peter Gutwein and our public health officials kept our community safe and tonight's result reflects that.

"I hope this campaign has been a wake-up call for the Liberals that Tasmanians will not tolerate business as usual from the government."

Political Editor at The Mercury, David Killick, has backed Tasmania Premier Peter Gutwein's decision to call an early election stating "the Liberals had the momentum" at the start of the campaign.

"Labor has gathered steam, so they've come home really strongly with a good campaign on health and emphasising voters should judge this government on its record over seven years, no just on the 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic," he said.

"It's a very different campaign this time. Last time, we had a single issue that dominated from the start and that was pokies. The differences were stark between the Liberals and Labor."

Tasmania's Opposition Leader Rebecca White has remained tight-lipped on whether she will remain the leader of the Labor Party if unsuccessful for a second time at the state election on Saturday.

"I'm campaigning to win. My focus is on winning... I'm not contemplating what happens... except a Labor victory," she said.

Ms White, along with Premier Peter Gutwein, refused to lead in a minority government.

Meanwhile, Mr Gutwein has been buoyed by the popularity of his strong COVID-19 policies, Tasmania being the first state to close borders when the pandemic reached Australia, prompting the premier to call a snap election 12 months early.

WA Premier Mark McGowan has made a call on whether the state will go back into lockdown after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive to COVID-19.
Perth and Peel are in lockdown limbo again after a hotel quarantine security guard and two of his housemates tested positive to COVID-19. The man now known as case 1001 was working at the Pan Pacific Hotel on the same floor as two positive international arrivals, but it's unclear how the guard became infected.

A security guard working in hotel quarantine in Perth has tested positive to COVID-19, with two of seven people sharing the man‘s house also returning positive results.
But the state will not go into lockdown “at this point”, Premier Mark McGowan said in a press conference on Saturday.
“But it’s possible this could change by tomorrow or the day after,” he said.
The security guard, a man in his twenties who lives in Nollamara, had already had his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, Mr McGowan said.
He had worked in the Pan Pacific Hotel on April 24, 25 and 26, during which time new arrivals were admitted to the hotel.
He worked on the same floor as two hotel quarantine residents who had tested positive to COVID-19.
“CCTV vision is being reviewed, however there is no clear explanation at this point as to how the security guard could have been infected,” Mr McGowan said.
“It is possible transmission could have occurred while the international arrivals were admitted into hotel quarantine and possibly were transferred to their rooms.
“This is being investigated further.”
The man’s household included two guests from Canberra, Mr McGowan said.
He said the man visited several locations in the community while likely to have been infectious, including a Northlands shopping centre, a Coles, a cafe and a mosque.
The full list of locations will be uploaded to the WA government website.
They currently include:

Premier Mark McGowan has called a snap Saturday afternoon press conference to update the city on coronavirus protocols — with it understood there is a new COVID-19 case involving a hotel security guard.
The Premier will speak at 3.15pm to “provide a COVID-19 update”.
The latest fears of a potential leak of the virus out of hotel quarantine come as Perth still endures some restrictions following the last quarantine breakdown.
The city locked down for the Anzac Day long weekend after two cases were confirmed emanating from the Mercure hotel in Perth’s CBD.
Exposure sites were pinpointed north and south of river, forcing millions inside their homes for three days, and mandatory mask wearing.
The masks are still in place, and will be for all of next week.
More to come.

After a devastating week, India has been struck by a third disaster, with a hospital fire claiming the lives of at least 15 COVID-19 patients.
THIS VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT. A fire broke out at a coronavirus hospital late at night on Friday, killing 16 people including two health workers in India's western Gujarat state.

After a devastating week of soaring coronavirus infections and deaths, and an earthquake causing “huge damage” to property and roads, India has been struck by another tragedy.
A fire at the Welfare Hospital in Bharuch, in the nation’s west, has killed at least 15 COVID-19 patients, after flames broke out in the dedicated virus ward – only a week after 13 virus patients died when an intensive care unit outside of Mumbai caught fire.
The cause of the blaze on Saturday is under investigation, according to officials, while dozens of people were rescued.
The nation’s hospitals and morgues have been overflowing, as the coronavirus death toll soared past 200,000 in recent days, and desperate families have been left to scour the capital for oxygen and medicine.
The vast South Asian nation of 1.3 billion is currently fighting a major surge of, on Friday, 385,000 new infections in 24 hours – the highest total anywhere in a single day that’s been recorded since the pandemic began.
Some experts have estimated the cases and deaths are likely between five and 10 times higher than what is being reported, while others believe it could be up to 30 times higher.

“It’s impossibly bad,” Dr Sumit Ray, the medical superintendent at Delhi’s Holy Family Hospital, told the ABC.
“It’s way beyond even what the media is able to capture. Not because they don’t want to. Even doctors don’t realise how bad it is.”
Speaking to the Financial Review, World Health Organisation (WHO) spokeswoman and expert in emergency risk communication, Margaret Harris, said that India has reminded the world of what it’s still up against in terms of COVID-19, even now that global vaccination efforts are underway.
“Nobody is safe until everybody is safe. This is a horrific demonstration of that,” she said.
“India has shown us that when this thing takes off, it really takes off.”
The nation’s second wave has largely been blamed on a new “double mutant” virus variant named B. 1.617.
The World Health Organisation recently listed B. 1.617 as a “variant of interest” but has stopped short of declaring it a “variant of concern”. That label would indicate that it is more dangerous than the original version of the virus by – for instance – being more transmissible, deadly or able to dodge vaccine protections.
Preliminary modelling indicates “that B. 1.617 has a higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility”.
The WHO also noted other more easily spread variants may be combining with B. 1.617 and “playing a role in the current resurgence in this country”.
RELATED: ‘Apocalyptic’: India’s COVID nightmare
Efforts to restrict the spread of the B. 1.617 variant haven’t been enough to prevent its detection in at least 10 other countries, including Britain and America.
Speaking to Business Insider, University of Michigan epidemiologist and biostatician, Professor Bhramer Mukherjee said that India’s “premature celebration of victory” should serve as a warning to other countries who are seeing case numbers decline.
“The double mutant is now in California, it is in the UK, and similar variants are going to circulate all over the world,” she said.
“It’s really a global problem.”

Brewers have welcomed a decision which will see liquor producers across the country receive tax cuts worth up to $250,000 a year after losing around $1 billion in beer sales throughout the pandemic. 

Brewers Association of Australia CEO John Preston told Sky News, “last year was a terrible year for many businesses but for hospitality and the beer industry it was particularly bad."

“We saw 44 million schooners of beer that had to be destroyed because of lockdowns and … $1 billion of lost sales across pubs and clubs in Australia.

“That’s why this is a great first step from the government, from the treasurer, and we welcome it.

“But we’ve actually also asked the government to consider reducing the tax on draft beer, the beer that’s sold through pubs and clubs, by 50 per cent in the budget.

“We believe that will really help that hospitality sector that’s really struggling and continues to struggle with lockdowns and other restrictions as they try to rebuild after COVID-19”. 

Mr Preston said Australia currently has the fourth highest beer tax in the developed world and it continues to increase twice a year.

Two locations within Brisbane’s International Airport have been linked to a transiting passenger who was infected with COVID-19.
Queensland’s chief health officer has declared Brisbane Airport’s International Terminal a venue of concern after a positive case was detected in one of two travellers mistakenly allowed access into the ‘green zone’. The two passengers from Port Moresby were allowed to enter the zone – instead of the ‘red zone’ for high-risk passengers – where 390 passengers were waiting to fly to New Zealand. Queensland Health on Thursday said the pair had tested negative before flying from Papua New Guinea, however, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today confirmed via Tweet that one of them had returned a positive test after landing in Australia. Passengers on board the three flights to New Zealand who were potentially in contact with the infected person have been instructed to closely monitor for symptoms.

Two locations within Brisbane’s International Airport have been linked to a transiting passenger who was infected with COVID-19.
In a statement, Queensland Health called on anyone who was at Hudson’s Coffee stand and the adjacent area between the coffee stand and the white barriers between 9.53am and 11.20am on Thursday, April 29 or the male toilets adjacent to Gate 79 between 11.23am and 11.15pm on Thursday, April 29 to isolate and get tested.
Queensland’s deputy chief health officer, Dr Sonya Bennett, said anyone who had been in these areas at the times specified needed to quarantine and get tested on Tuesday, May 4, five days after their exposure.
“It is likely that all of these contacts will be in New Zealand and NZ’s public health authorities are providing similar advice to people,” Dr Bennett said.
“However, we need to make sure we capture any contacts who remain in Australia. Having viewed CCTV footage, we believe people who have been to these locations during the times of exposure face a potential risk.

“We need them to quarantine and get tested five days after visiting these locations. That is the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 so if they are negative, they will be safe to leave quarantine.
“This is precautionary but we are taking no chances.”
The airport was dubbed a “venue of concern” on Friday after a passenger, who had travelled from Papua New Guinea, potentially exposed coronavirus to 390 passengers who flew to New Zealand from Brisbane on three separate flights.
Despite travelling from a “red zone” or high risk country, an employee mistakenly directed the infected man to the safe “green zone” area at Brisbane Airport, where other passengers were waiting to travel to New Zealand.
Serology tests revealed the man was likely to have been at a late stage of his infection – meaning he posed a low risk to other passengers at the airport. Both he and his travel partner were appropriately masked and socially distanced.

On Friday afternoon, chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said that “errors happen”.
“We know they happen, which is why we have all of those other mitigating factors in place, and they all worked so it was picked up,” she told reporters.
Dr Young added that the incident had not led to “any significant risk” and authorities had thoroughly investigated to ensure there were no problems.
Four new cases in NSW quarantine
In NSW, meanwhile, while no new local infections of COVID-19 have been recorded, four cases were detected in hotel quarantine in the last 24 hours, bringing the state’s total number of cases in quarantine in the last seven days to 62.
The rise in infections – with 15 reported in quarantine on Thursday alone – amid an increase in concern over the use of hotels in densely populated cities to house returning travellers, as new variants spread at an alarming pace in nations like India and Brazil.
Michael Toole, a Professor of International Health at the Burnet Institute, wrote earlier this week for The Conversationthat it’s “time to move quarantine out of city hotels”, after more than a dozen COVID leaks in six months.
NSW recorded no new locally acquired cases of #COVID19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. Four new cases were acquired overseas to 8pm last night, bringing the total number of cases in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic to 5,292. pic.twitter.com/ARRoyZsZ8P
Echoing the urgings of other experts and state leaders, prominently West Australian Premier Mark McGowan, Professor Toole said remote facilities like decent ventilation like the Northern Territory’s Howard Springs facility would be ideal to use for the system, given the rising threat.
“It’s now time to invest in similar facilities in every state and territory. Quarantine is our first line of defence against the virus,” he wrote.
“It needs to be 100 per cent effective to maintain our hard-earned status of having zero community COVID cases.
“Given the rate of quarantine leaks during the past six months, without improvements, the system will likely see over a dozen more leaks by October, causing frequent disruptions to our lives. The impact on the economy and public confidence will be immeasurable.”

A high-profile doctor who endorsed controversial treatments for coronavirus has died in hospital after contracting the virus.
With several strains of the virus already circulating, will the current vaccines still be effective?

A doctor in Kenya who advised citizens against getting vaccinated has died from coronavirus.
Stephen Karanja, who served as the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association chairman, advised mask-wearing and mass testing as the most effective ways to stamp out the pandemic, clashing with local bishops who have been urging Kenyans to get inoculated.
The Catholic Health Comission reported the controversial doctor — whose age is not publicly known — was admitted to hospital last week before succumbing to the respiratory disease on April 29.
Dr Karanja remained staunch the current global rollout of the fast-tracked vaccine was “totally unnecessary, making the motivation suspect”.
He instead endorsed alternative treatments for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine and the hotly-debated Ivermectin.
“There are drugs that have been repurposed and used effectively to treat Covid-19,” he said in a March statement.
“We advise that a COVID-19 vaccine is unnecessary and should not be given. We appeal to all the people of Kenya to avoid taking it.”
Kenyan Roman Catholic Bishop Philip Anyolo openly opposed the doctor’s claim, insisting the rollout is being carried out in a “objective and well-co-ordinated manner” in Kenya.

“It should be noted that those doctors cannot and should not purport to speak in the name of the Catholic Church. We, the Catholic bishops in Kenya, avail our vast network of healthcare facilities to be utilised to ensure the vaccination is rolled out in an objective and well-co-ordinated manner,” Mr Anyolo said via Kenyan news outlet Tuko.
WHO attempted to dispel concerns raised by Dr Karanja in March, stressing to the public the vaccine had been rigorously reviewed and deemed safe by “stringent regulatory authorities”.
Dr Karanja had a history of controversy over his opinions on public health issues and vaccination campaigns, publicly opposing the vaccination of schoolgirls against cervical cancer in 2019.
Dr Karanja said the jab against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) was unnecessary because it affected those “whose lifestyle involves irresponsible sexual behaviours”.
He was also a strong anti-abortion campaigner, appearing in court to testify against the government changing of abortion guidelines in 2018.
In 2014, he gained attention after declaring a nationwide rollout of a tetanus vaccination, claiming it was a sterilising campaign against women.

Debate rages in Africa over Ivermectin
Ivermectin is a medication used to treat many types of parasite infestations including head lice and scabies.
Its effectiveness in treating coronavirus is currently under hot debate between medical professionals and politicians globally.
In April 2020, Australian researchers published results from a laboratory experiment suggesting Ivermectin could stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiplying in animal cells under a microscope.
“This discovery was exciting, however even the researchers themselves have cautioned that this one study is not enough to prove the medicine will work against COVID-19 in humans,” NPS MedicineWise said in an article detailing new information on ivermectin.
Independent MP Craig Kelly attracted attention online this month over his endorsement of the treatment before having his Facebook account banned for “repeated spreading of misinformation”.
WHO officials believe results on Ivermectin’s effectiveness are still inconclusive after conducting 16 randomised trials with a panel of independent clinical experts.

“They determined that the evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of “very low certainty,” the WHO’s official statement read.
The debate over ivermectin is currently roaring in South Africa, where demand for the drug -- which is only registered to treat parasites in animals -- has inflated the price fifteen fold after a number doctors began prescribing it in mid-2020.
Professor Nathi Mdladla, head of the intensive care unit at Durban‘s George Mukhari Academic Hospital, said the demand for medical practitioners to try alternative treatments grew incredibly quickly with bodies piling up during the peak of the pandemic.
“The fight is about the quality of the studies that have been done so far. What we‘re saying is that in a pandemic, you can never be in a position to actually generate these high-level, long studies, because it means in the meantime, you watch people die,” Dr Mdladla said.
But South African critical care specialist Rietze Rodseth says the evidence is simply too weak for high-ranking public health officials to endorse.
“I‘m quite surprised by everybody’s petitioning and going on about the wonders of this drug. The evidence base and quality of the studies done so far are pretty weak. We simply do not have enough evidence to say: ’Yes this works.’” he told the BBC.
In Australia, ivermectin is an approved treatment for scabies, the tropical diseases onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis, and a skin condition called rosacea.

Additional pallets of oxygen cylinders were packaged to leave Travis Air Force Base in California on April 28, headed for India, where a second wave of coronavirus has seen hospitals struggle. The White House said the US would supply India with more than $100 million worth of “urgent relief.” Officials said aid flights would begin arriving in India on April 29, carrying, besides oxygen, personal protective equipment (PPE), vaccine manufacturing supplies, and rapid diagnostic tests. The US Department of Defense shared footage of the “brand-new, high-quality supplies” in the 60th Aerial Port Squadron Warehouse at the base in Solano County, California. Officials said the donation of 440 oxygen cylinders and regulators, one million N-95 masks, and one million COVID-19 rapid diagnostic kits would be transported to India aboard a US Air Force C-5M Super Galaxy.

A 34-year-old man has become the latest in a string of patients to take their own life after a COVID-19 diagnosis in India, as the nation reels from a brutal second wave.
The patient reportedly took his own life at a hospital in the city of Lucknow in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
Kamal Kishore, a farmer from the city of Sitapur just north of Lucknow, was undergoing chronic kidney disease treatment and had been on dialysis since 2018 after his both kidneys stopped working.
He was admitted to the COVID-dedicated Rajdhani Hospital at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) on April 18 after testing positive for coronavirus on April 16.

According to a press release issued by SGPGI, Mr Kishore also tested positive in a second test.
“He was taken to the trauma centre but was declared dead,” said Anand Prakash Shukla, the Station House Officer (SHO) at SGPGI. His body has now been handed to police.
Mr Shukla said Mr Kishore was having health issues and that the evidence indicated he had taken his own life, although authorities were not yet ruling anything out.
“The man was not keeping well and our investigation is on in this regard as we can’t rule out anything,” Mr Shukla said.
On April 28, a 26-year-old man identified as Dilip Kumar also took his own life at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) building in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, after he was admitted to the COVID ward as a suspected case.
In another similar incident, a teenager named Suryansh Pathak took his own life in Panchkula, Haryana state, after his parents tested positive for coronavirus.

The news comes as the escalating situation in India shows no signs of slowing, with a deadly second wave overwhelming hospitals, morgues and crematoriums.
India now accounts for than more 40 per cent of the world’s new COVID cases, with an average of nearly 350,000 new cases a day.
The first US emergency aid to India arrived on Friday as the country reported another 385,000 new cases in the past 24 hours — a new global record — and almost 500 deaths, according to official data that many experts suspect falls short of the true toll.
More than 40 countries have committed to sending vital medical aid, particularly oxygen supplies, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters Thursday. The promised supplies from Australia, Britain, Russia, UAE, Qatar and elsewhere include almost 550 oxygen-generating plants, more than 4,000 oxygen concentrators, 10,000 oxygen cylinders as well as 17 cryogenic tankers.

But several states said they would be unable to begin vaccinating all over-18s from this weekend as planned because they do not have sufficient stock, with the rollout threatened by administrative bickering, confusion over prices and technical glitches on the government’s digital vaccine platform.
Authorities are battling a national disaster as overwhelmed hospitals run out of beds and patients are treated on the streets, while patients’ relatives desperately hunt for medicines and oxygen cylinders.
India also has the world’s highest number of daily deaths, recording 2882 per day on average this week, with Brazil second at 2526 per day and the United States a distant third at 701.
Many crematoriums are facing shortages of wood because of the surge in deaths, with each pyre requiring between 300 and 400 kilos of timber.

Sky News contributor Gemma Tognini says there has been a “borderline savage” response to Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan’s approach to COVID-19.

The Perth and the Peel regions recently went into a snap three-day lockdown after recording just one positive case of COVID-19.

“Everyone I think suspected that post the election there would be a mellowing, a reasoning of his approach,” Ms Tognini told Sky News host Catherine McGregor.

“But no, there was almost disbelief that he was going to lock the whole Perth and Peel area down for one case.

“It’s the narrative that the McGowan regime is using.”

Podcast host Joe Rogan has insisted he’s “not an anti-vax person” after sparking outrage with his comments about the coronavirus vaccine.

Joe Rogan has back-pedalled on his claim that healthy young people don’t need to get vaccinated against COVID-19 — insisting he’s “not an anti-vax person.”
On his popular podcast Joe Rogan Experience, the 53-year-old comedian downplayed his own credibility after his comments sparked outrage on social media and a response from Dr. Anthony Fauci.
“I’m not a doctor, I’m a f**cking moron,” Rogan said. “I’m not a respected source of information, even for me … But I at least try to be honest about what I’m saying.”
RELATED: White House, Fauci take down Joe Rogan

He clarified that the comments made on his podcast last week — that young, healthy people don’t “need to worry about ” getting the shots — didn’t stem from a belief that vaccines are dangerous.
“I’m not an anti-vax person,” he said. “I said I believe they’re safe and I encourage many people to take them. My parents were vaccinated. I just said that if you’re a young, healthy person that you don’t need it.”
He added that he was scheduled to get a Johnson & Johnson jab before it was put on pause by the authorities earlier this month.
Rogan also acknowledged claims by the nation’s top infectious disease expert Dr Fauci and the White House that his comments were incorrect — but stopped short of admitting he was wrong.
“There’s some legitimate science behind this … Their argument was, you need it for other people,” he said. “But that’s a different argument. That’s a different conversation.”

‘I’m not a doctor, I’m a f**cking moron,’ Rogan he told podcast listeners. Picture: WireImage.Source:Getty Images
On Wednesday, Dr Fauci slammed Rogan’s claim that young healthy people don’t need to be vaccinated, calling the mentality wrongheaded and selfish.
“You’re talking about yourself in a vacuum,” Dr Fauci said. “If you want to only worry about yourself and not society, then that’s OK. But you’re saying to yourself, ‘Even if I get infected, I could do damage to somebody else even if I have no symptoms at all,’ and that’s the reason why you’ve got to be careful and get vaccinated.”
Rogan’s podcast reportedly rakes in more than 190 million downloads per month.
In the offending episode, the UFC commentator said it was “crazy” that people were considering getting their children vaccinated.
“People say, ‘Do you think it’s safe to get vaccinated?’ I’ve said, ‘Yeah, I think for the most part it’s safe to get vaccinated’. I do. I do,” Rogan said in a conversation with comedian Dave Smith.
“But if you’re like 21 years- ld, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go, ‘No’.
“If you’re a healthy person, and you’re exercising all the time, and you’re young, and you’re eating well, like, I don’t think you need to worry about this.
“We’re talking about something that is not statistically dangerous for children. But yet people still want you to get your child vaccinated, which is crazy to me.”
Rogan’s comments go against guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which specify that vaccinations are safe for everyone over the age of 16.

The government has denied it is leaving thousands of Australians to the mercy of the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak in India.
Health Minister Greg Hunt says the government is focused on making sure there is a “pathway” for Australians in India to be repatriated as soon as possible after May 15. “Once we’ve seen a reduction in the number of cases in Howard Springs and the same is the case with regards to commercial flights, those final decisions will be taken by the National Cabinet,” he said. “But what we’re seeing is lifting of the pressure within both the hotel quarantine and within the Howard Springs facility. “That is opening up the possibility for that resumption exactly as discussed as early as possible subject to the final National Cabinet decision.”

Australians stuck in India are not being left to the mercy of the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak, despite new jail terms and massive fines for those seeking to return from India, the treasurer says.
Returning citizens who have been in India in the past two weeks will be threatened with the prison sentence or a $66,000 fine.
The law, the first in Australia’s history making it illegal for citizens to return home, comes into effect from Monday and will be reviewed on May 15.
But Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Saturday rejected the suggestion the government was abandoning around 9000 Australians in India, which has suffered oxygen and medical shortages as it grapples with the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak.

“We have taken drastic action to keep Australians safe,” he said.
“(But) this is a temporary measure ... The situation in India is dire and very serious, and we need to take and act on the medical advice that was provided to us.”
Mr Frydenberg said Australia’s plan to ship oxygen and medical equipment to India was the “best thing to do” to ease the crisis.
The treasurer also rejected suggestions the move showed a lack of confidence in the nation’s quarantine system.
“This is about what our quarantine system can handle with the number of cases coming from India,” he said.
Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek accepted the need to pause returns from India, but said that was only necessary because the government’s hotel quarantine system had failed.
“What we’re talking about is way too late,” she said on Saturday.
“This just shows that if Scott Morrison had properly got his act together a year ago, when he was told that we needed several quarantine facilities, imagine how different things would be now.”
Health Minister Greg Hunt revealed late on Friday night the measure was proportionate to the escalating COVID-19 threat on the subcontinent.
“The government does not make these decisions lightly,” he said.
“However, it is critical the integrity of the Australian public health and quarantine systems is protected and the number of COVID-19 cases in quarantine facilities is reduced to a manageable level.”
The laws come into effect at 12.01am on Monday and will be reviewed on May 15.
India is experiencing the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak. The nation recorded more that 386,000 cases on Friday, the biggest single-day increase in any country since the pandemic began.
Australia has paused all direct flights from India for at least three weeks, fuelled by a rise in the number of positive cases linked to recent repatriation flights from the country.

The country is currently facing a massive humanitarian crises as the sick face a lack of hospital beds and distraught people flood social media with pleas for oxygen and medicine.
The federal government this week agreed to ship medical supplies to India, including ventilators and oxygen.
“Our hearts go out to the people of India – and our Indian-Australian community,” he said.
“ The friends and family of those in Australia are in extreme risk. Tragically, many are contracting COVID-19 and many, sadly, are dying every day.”
It comes after a loophole allowed travellers from COVID-ravaged India to avoid Australia’s flight ban this week by transiting through Qatar’s capital Doha.
Australian cricketers Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson were among those who took advantage of the loophole after leaving the Indian Premier League, but bought the commercial flights before the announcement of the new travel restrictions.
Following the revelations, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said there would be new restrictions to deter people from exploiting the system.
Mr Hunt on Friday said the government hoped to allow flights back into Australia “as soon as possible”.
“The focus is to make sure that we are keeping Australians safe, at a time of an expanded global pandemic,” he said.

A teenager in COVID-ravaged India was allegedly subjected to an hour-long gang rape by two men who lured her to a home with the promise of a vaccine.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.

A teenage girl in a COVID-ravaged Indian city has allegedly been gang-raped by two men who lured her to a deserted house with the promise of a vaccine.
The distressing ordeal — as India continues to be battered by its second COVID-19 wave — emerged from the Jamunapur area of Patna city of the northeast Indian state of Bihar on Tuesday.
The accused, Mantu and Rocky, were arrested a day after the alleged gang rape and are behind bars in the Malsalami police station.
“They have been booked under 376D and the investigation is on,” a police source said.
“We would also see whether they have been involved before in any case or not.”

The alleged victim (name withheld) said: “I begged before them to set me free, but they behaved like beasts and started touching my private parts. Before I could show some resistance they slapped me repeatedly.
“They took me to a house and started grabbing me.
“Before I could try to run away from the spot they tied my legs and hands to cover my mouth with a hanky.”

The frightened girl managed to free herself and reached home where she told her parents about the horrific incident. They then called the police.
The duo confirmed persuading the girl with the promise of a COVID vaccine at one of Patna’s health facilities.
Police were working to verify the teen’s age, with a possibility of adding more charges against the two men from Jamunapur village.
“If she happens to be below 18, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act will also take place in the charge sheet against the criminals,” the investigation officer maintained.

Bihar has recorded a total number of 441,000 cases since the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2021.
On April 28 the registration for the second phase of the mega vaccination drive kicked off — and citizens above the age of 18 will get a jab from May 1.
So far, 2391 deaths were reported in the state which has also witnessed a surge in the death rate since the double mutant virus was identified in India.
Health industry experts have also warned India is going to face a vaccine shortage from May 1, given the demand of the tens of thousands of beneficiaries.
As of now, the country has access to 70 million doses of Covishield monthly, apart from 20 million doses of Covaxin.

Australia suspended flights with India as COVID cases rise by up to 600 per cent in some hotels – but critics say the move is a grave error.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone - including vaccinated populations.

Australia is grappling with a huge increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in hotel quarantine — up 600 per cent in some facilities — but some are questioning whether the suspension of flights from India is appropriate.
The Federal Government announced this week that it would suspend flights from India, leaving thousands stranded, including 650 registered as vulnerable, to give facilities in Australia breathing space as they struggle to contain a growing number of cases.
Health Minister Greg Hunt confirmed late on Friday night that Australians who return to the country from India will face five years in jail, a $66,000 fine, or both. It is the first law in Australia’s history making it illegal for citizens to return home.
Data analyst Anthony Macali, founder of COVID Live, said there had been a substantial increase in positive cases in hotel quarantine, but unfortunately, it was not possible to know which countries these cases were coming from.
“We can definitely see NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory all reaching levels of overseas acquired infections that we haven’t seen since the beginning of the pandemic,” he told news.com.au.
In NSW, the seven-day average for positive cases is now around nine to 10 cases a day.
“We’ve never hit that level before,” he said.
As a comparison, in February and March, there were on average two to three cases a day in NSW quarantine, and this has sometimes reached around six or seven cases a day.
“If there are more cases there is a higher chance of breaches occurring,” Mr Macali said.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean you will get a breach but you should obviously be on high alert and it’s testing the limits because we have never taken this many positive cases from overseas before,” he said.
It’s a similar story in the Northern Territory. Its Howard Springs quarantine facility hasn’t had any breaches in six months since it opened, but Mr Macali said it was previously only dealing with one or two positive cases a day.
“In the last two weeks this has jumped from an average of under one, to almost six cases a day, which is huge. It’s a 600 per cent increase,” he said.

While authorities including in NSW have noted an increase in the number of positive cases in travellers returning from India, Mr Macali said this was not yet clear in the publicly available figures, as they were a week behind.
Unlike New Zealand, which published details of cases when it also banned flights from India on April 11, Australian authorities did not publish a breakdown of where cases were coming from.
Mr Macali said the lack of information in Australia made it difficult to understand the scale of the problem and to debate whether other options could be considered.
A Northern Territory Health spokeswoman told news.com.au there had been 122 positive cases among overseas travellers since October 23.
“Positive cases have left departure ports in India, United Kingdom, Germany, France, South Africa,” she said.
The latest weekly data from NSW Health found 35 per cent of cases in the state’s hotel quarantine system were from Indian travellers in the four weeks up to April 24.
Of the 137 cases, 48 cases were from Indian travellers, 14 per cent (19 cases) were from Bangladesh and 10 per cent (14 cases) were from the United States.
“In March and April 2021, there has been an increase in detections of COVID-19 in travellers from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,” the report said.
Is travel ban a ‘massive over-reaction’?
Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Tuesday that there had been a concerning increase in the percentage of cases in hotel quarantine that had their origins in India.
He said in the week beginning April 16, there had been a jump in the total number of cases in quarantine that had so far not been recorded this year.
“It went from 90 the previous week to 143 the following week,” he said.
He said the change was particularly noticeable in the Northern Territory and New South Wales, which both have direct flights from India.
Almost 95 per cent of cases in the NT were coming from India, he said.
“So it’s important to take this pause to enable those quarantine facilities, particularly in the Northern Territory, to be able to work through the system and return to lower levels, so we will be able to resume supporting getting Australians home,” he said.
Travellers from high risk countries, which so far only includes India, will also be asked to return a negative PCR test 72 hours prior to entering Australia from the final point of embarkation.
Mr Morrison pointed out that flights from Papua New Guinea to Queensland were similarly suspended in March, which saw the number of infections from that country drop significantly.
“That has meant that the system in Queensland has had the stress come off it from the Papua New Guinean arrivals and that’s proved to be very effective,” he said.
He said the “pause arrangement” gave facilities the opportunity to ensure they could deal with cases and then enable authorities to “step off from a stronger position in a few weeks’ time”.
However, one journalist asked whether the flight ban was a “massive over-reaction”.
There has been only 16 breaches in hotel quarantine among the 160,000 arrivals in the six months between October 27 and April 22, representing just 0.01 per cent of those who go through the system.
Mr Morrison said the advice of the NT Government and the Federal Government’s medical advisers was “we need to slow that pace significantly over the next few weeks to ensure that we can maintain the health of people in that facility”.

“This will also give some breathing space to the NSW arrangements and allow in NSW people from other countries to come back and go through that quarantine system,” Mr Morrison said.
“We have always taken a cautious approach. Australia can speak of a performance during the global pandemic on COVID-19 that few countries can, and one of the reasons for that is we’ve always listened to the medical advice.”
‘An act out of fear’
But University of NSW Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, who is a World Health Organisation adviser, has noted a Guardian analysis of data showed India had fewer cases per capita than either the United States or the United Kingdom during their COVID peaks.
She said the data suggested the Morrison Government’s ban on flights from India was likely “an act out of fear” and it must offer a route home for citizens “to ensure there is no misconception the ban is in any way racist”.
Communications specialist Parnell Palme McGuinness said it was devastating that flights from India had been cut rather than increased.
“This is a decision about cutting off flights, which is just unconscionable,” Ms McGuinness said while on ABC’s Q&A panel on Thursday.
“They are flying supplies to make vaccine and provide oxygen to India. And the planes are coming back empty.
“They need to be coming back filled with people who need help.”
India is in the grip of a devastating outbreak, surpassing more than 18 million cases this week and setting a new single-day record on Thursday after confirming 379,257 cases and 3645 deaths.
Constitutional law PhD candidate at Melbourne Law School, Liz Hicks, noted that a defective quarantine system not designed to accommodate aerosol transmission will continue to leak even with the reduced cap.
“It will merely do so at a lower rate,” she wrote in The Conversation.
“Australian governments have argued it is necessary to reduce the number of positive cases in quarantine. This implicitly acknowledges fundamental flaws in Australia’s hotel quarantine programs.”

Queensland has introduced an extremely strict new coronavirus rule that could have huge implications for people who have left the state.
Queensland’s chief health officer has declared Brisbane Airport’s International Terminal a venue of concern after a positive case was detected in one of two travellers mistakenly allowed access into the ‘green zone’. The two passengers from Port Moresby were allowed to enter the zone – instead of the ‘red zone’ for high-risk passengers – where 390 passengers were waiting to fly to New Zealand. Queensland Health on Thursday said the pair had tested negative before flying from Papua New Guinea, however, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today confirmed via Tweet that one of them had returned a positive test after landing in Australia. Passengers on board the three flights to New Zealand who were potentially in contact with the infected person have been instructed to closely monitor for symptoms.

Anyone in Queensland who has visited an exposure site in another state must go into quarantine for 14 days, the state’s chief health officer Jeannette Young announced on Friday.
The extreme move was made “to protect the health and safety of Queensland residents, and interstate travellers that come into Queensland”, she said.
The new directive means:
All people are encouraged to monitor the Queensland Health interstate exposure venue lists for 14 days after they arrive in the state to ensure no new venues have been added. This includes venues in New Zealand.
Interstate exposure sites are listed on each state health website and include several restaurants in Western Australia, Terminal 1 of Melbourne Airport, Bunnings and a food court in Auckland.

Dr Young said anyone with symptoms, no matter how mild, should come forward and get tested straight away.
“Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, and loss of taste or smell,” she said.
“As we’ve seen over the past couple of weeks, we’re still in this pandemic and we can’t be complacent.
“It is critical we detect any cases that we may not be aware of as quickly as possible through our testing system.”

Worldwide Covid-19 cases passed 150 million on Friday, as the number of new daily infections reach levels not seen since the beginning of the pandemic, according to an AFP count.
Worldwide Covid-19 cases passed 150 million on Friday, as the number of new daily infections reach levels not seen since the beginning of the pandemic, according to an AFP count.
150.3 million cases have been declared since the virus was first discovered in China in December 2019, according to an AFP compilation of official data -- with numbers soaring recently due to a relentless second wave in India, where 2.5 million cases have been detected in the past seven days.

Australians could get the COVID-19 jab earlier, as a critical stage of the vaccine rollout is pushed forward.
The data is coming in for vaccine side effects Aussies are experiencing, so how serious are they?
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt says phase 2a of the vaccine rollout will be brought forward. Picture: NCA NewsWire / David GeraghtySource:News Corp Australia
Australians above the age of 50 will be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has revealed.
Phase 2a of the vaccine rollout will be brought forward to next week for people aged 50 and over, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders adults, and any critical or high risk workers who have not already been vaccinated.
“Already over 400 (GP practices) will be opening next week, so we will have 136 general practice respiratory clinics, commonwealth clinics opening next week,” Mr Hunt told reporters on Friday afternoon.
“They are bringing forward the phase 2a … it’s more opportunity for Australians to be vaccinated earlier.”
It follows a national cabinet meeting where the state premiers discussed the coronavirus vaccine as well as border concerns with India.

The subcontinent is plagued with coronavirus infections, posting a daily rise in cases of 386,452 on Friday, while deaths from the virus jumped by 3498 in the past 24 hours.
“The briefing I have had is very clear that the focus of that (national cabinet) is to make sure that we are keeping Australians safe at a time of an expanded global pandemic,” Mr Hunt said.
“The figures we know are reaching extraordinary levels, and so we have put the pause on the flights from India, but in particular, the Prime Minister and national cabinet were focused on making sure we have a pathway for repatriation flights from India to begin as soon as possible, after May 15, once we have seen a reduction in the number of cases.”

A 60-year-old returned traveller with coronavirus has been put on oxygen in ICU as the state records two new cases in hotel quarantine.
The WA premier Mark McGowan has taken a dig at NSW's coronavirus response.
A man in his 60s with COVID-19 has been transferred to the Royal Adelaide Hospital from hotel quarantine.
Health authorities say he has been in quarantine in the Toms Court medi-hotel since his arrival in Australia from overseas. It is not known where he travelled from.
He is said to be in a stable condition on oxygen in intensive care.
Meanwhile, WA premier Mark McGowan has taken a dig at NSW’s coronavirus response, saying his state has “basically done better than any other state in Australia”.
While praise has been heaped on the NSW Premier for her ability to keep the state open while controlling outbreaks and receiving the biggest number of overseas arrivals – Mr McGowan said his approach was better and cost the state’s economy far less.
It comes as flights from COVID-stricken India remain paused until May 15th when the government hopes the number of cases in the Howard Springs quarantine facility decrease.
This live blog is now closed. You can read our updates of today’s news below.
Qatar Airways has closed the sneaky passage to Australia via Doha after two cricketers flew back yesterday in the nick of time.
It comes after the ABC first reported that flights were still available with transit through the Qatar capital, despite the Prime Minister's previous assurance that the pause on flights from India was airtight, with no access through Doha, Kuala Lumpur or Singapore.
Mr Morrison said today: "We've directly dealt with the airlines in Qatar, so those transit passengers the airlines advise us are no longer coming through from Doha."
Qatar Airways confirmed they are no long carrying passengers on this route in a statement.
Scott Morrison has provided an update following today's National Cabinet meeting, but has not confirmed whether the block on flights from India will lift on May 15th.
Regarding the spiralling situation in COVID-stricken India following another spike in deaths, the statement said: "National Cabinet noted the significant increase in cases in India and welcomed the Commonwealth Government’s support package including oxygen concentrators, PPE and oxygen tanks and consumables. National Cabinet expressed solidarity with the Indian community both within Australia and overseas."
It reiterated that the Cabinet would review the suspension on flights from India before the proposed date of May 15th.
"The Commonwealth will consider further measures to mitigate risks of high risk travellers entering Australia."
On Australia's vaccine rollout, it said: "To date 2,179,544 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Australia. The number of administration sites has expanded, with 4,500 general practices as well as general practice respiratory centres and Aboriginal health services now administering COVID-19 vaccinations.
"National Cabinet agreed the imperative to work together to administer COVID-19 vaccinations to Australians as quickly as possible."
National Cabinet will meet again next Friday.
An emotional Brittany Higgins has addressed the media after her meeting with Scott Morrison.
"The Prime Minister acknowledged the system had let me down and we agreed that there needs to be reformed," the 26-year-old said.
"It was a difficult conversation to have at a personal level. It was very hard to come here," she added, appearing to fight back tears.
"But, we had a discussion about what needs to happen in terms of the MoPs Act, where there needs to be better safeguard the staffers, where the power dynamic between parliamentarians and individual staffers.
"We also had a robust discussion about the need for an independent authority about human resources, as they made the case in 2007 about entitlements being a big issue, and that was the start. The government brought that in, the government of the day."
She concluded: "It was a difficult conversation, it was robust, but ultimately, in the end, I think there was a consensus that reform needs to happen."
Elsewhere, responding to a question from a reporter, she said she didn't feel a sense of "relief" from the meeting.
"It was hard. It was difficult. It wasn't easy. But, I think it was a conversation that needs to be had. It was an honest and frank discussion. It is important that we had it."
She also said that Mr Morrison seemed to "fundamentally understand" what had happened to her "in a more holistic way."

Queensland Health has implemented a new direction for people who have been in an interstate exposure venue.
Under the new process, anyone entering Queensland who has been in a venue flagged as an exposure site will be directed to quarantine for 14 days in government accommodation.
A statement further outlines: "If you are already in Queensland and have been to an interstate exposure venue during the specified exposure period, you must call 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) and explain your situation.
"You must immediately travel by private transport directly to your home or accommodation and quarantine until you receive further instructions from Queensland Health."
There are currently restrictions in the state as to when you can leave quarantine and when you have to wear a mask.
Dr Young said anyone with symptoms, no matter how mild, should come forward and get tested straight away.
“It is critical we detect any cases that we may not be aware of as quickly as possible through our testing system” she said.
Queensland's Chief Health Officer Jeanette Young said Brisbane International Airport intends to conduct a review into yesterday's slip-up.
It is understood a relatively new staff member accidentally allowed two passengers – one who was COVID-positive – to enter the dining and shopping area of the terminal for an hour and a half.
"They have worked with us every single step of the way. And the response here was superb," she said.
Dr Jeanette Young. Picture: NCA NewsWire
"They'll now go through (CCTV footage) and work out what did go wrong."
While both passengers were wearing masks, one tested positive to the virus yesterday.
The man has since returned a positive test, meaning the risk of infecting others in the airport remains low, according to Dr Young.
"That suggests to me, as well with the serology results, that he's right at the end of his illness — he could almost be fully recovered," she said.
Dr Young has still declared the international terminal a venue of concern.
Asked about the two passengers from Papua New Guinea who were accidentally let into Brisbane Airport's green zone this week, Mr Hunt stressed that exposure to other passengers was "low risk".
But he was quick to assert the health breach was "unacceptable".
"Most importantly, the advice from the Queensland Chief Health Officer is that this is a low risk situation, the two individuals in question maintained their masks on their advice, at all times, and also maintained a distancing in what was an area with a low number of people," he said.

Last night, health authorities sent out an urgent alert after two passengers on a red flight from Papua New Guinea were let into a green zone of the airport.
The pair dined at the airport’s Hudson Cafe for about an hour and half, before using the toilets and visiting a second retail outlet.
Mr Hunt said it was a new staff member who let them slip through the cracks.
"Every day, does not matter where it is coming whether it is state, private, or public, we are always seeking to improve, and so we will work with Queensland, and with the Brisbane airport Corporation to make sure they do not do that again, it is a very clear that the advice I have is that it is a relatively new private staff member from within the Brisbane airport Corporation firm.
"But it will be very clear that that is unacceptable, most importantly the advice on Queensland health is that it is low risk, and public safety is our number one priority."
Mr Hunt said Scott Morrison and the National Cabinet are making plans to arrange repatriation flights from India once cases in Howard Springs are under control.
It comes after both repatriation and commercial flights into the Howard Springs facility near Darwin was put on pause until at least May 15.
Mr Hunt suggested it was likely the May 15 date would still go ahead.
"What we are seeing (is) lifting of pressure within both the hotel quarantine and within the Howard Springs facility, and that is opening up the possibility for the resumption exactly as discussed, as early as possible, subject to the National Cabinet decision."
Mr Hunt refused to answer a question on providing vaccines and financial support to Australians stuck in India.
"I will not preempt anything on financial support. The question on vaccinations is a challenging one for Australians overseas. We have to ensure there is a cold chain integrity, support of countries and that is something we're always taking advice on and it is advice that we have to take in terms of what is achievable and what is not."
He added that there were no new cases in Australia today, and there have been 67,000 vaccinations in the last 24 hours, bringing our total up to 2.17 million.
Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for children suffering from a rare form of epilepsy.
"Commencing from May 1, from tomorrow, a new medicine will be available for Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy that particularly impacts children," he said live from Melbourne.
"(It is) the first occasion that a medicinal cannabis product has been made available on the PBS, cannabis oil, and it literally can help save and protect lives."
He said around 116 children affected will receive the medicine that would otherwise cost them $24,000, giving them "a shot at normality".

India is set to receive hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses as 40 countries pledge support to the nation which is battling a second wave of COVID-19. 

The country will also receive 550 oxygen generating plants, 4,000 oxygen concentrators and 10,000 cylinders while 17 cryogenic oxygen tankers are set to arrive in the next few days.    

“I think everybody is really focussed on trying to collaborate, trying to work together and to really interrupt the trajectory we’re seeing of cases,” UNICEF Australia Director of International Programs Felicity Butler-Wever said. 

“For UNICEF we are working with the government, we’re working to help strengthen the health system and its response, providing oxygen generators … to hospitals across the country.

“We really can’t underestimate how big a priority this is at the moment."

Ms Butler-Wever told Sky News UNICEF is calling on “everyday Australians and businesses” to help with “critical funding shortages” to support the organisation in its efforts to provide resources to India.

Heartbreaking photos captured the moment an Indian woman desperately tried to save her COVID-19 infected husband after being refused entry to a hospital.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.

Helpless bystanders witnessed a heartbreaking scene in India as a woman desperately tried to save her COVID-19 infected husband’s life.
Renu Singhal, 45, a resident of Awas Vikas Sector 7 in Agra of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, desperately gave her husband Ravi Singhal, 47, CPR in an auto-rickshaw just metres from a packed medical centre
As Renu knew her husband could die any moment and, with no oxygen cylinder available, she took it upon herself to try and save her husband’s life.
The rickshaw was parked outside a government health facility that Renu had hoped would have oxygen when Ravi’s condition rapidly deteriorated.

Upon seeing this Renu screamed for help but with the nearby facility already overflowing with COVID-19 patients it turned out to be a futile exercise, leaving her with no option but to try mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
“I looked for help but there was no one around who could have wheeled in my husband as he was unable to move,” Renu said.
The grief-stricken Renu tried everything possible to keep her husband alive. At one moment she would give her CPR before clutching a bottle and sprinkling water over Ravi, pleading with him to hold on.
“I’ve no one else Ravi, please do not leave me alone,” a panicked Renu told her husband who was gasping for breath.
Renu’s desperate attempts went in vain as Ravi passed away in her arms. Later, Renu also got confirmation from Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC) where doctors pronounced Ravi as dead.

Renu was distraught and held her husband in her lap while hoping against hope that Ravi would open his eyes, but her efforts couldn’t revive him.
“My husband was in home isolation and was suffering from high-grade fever and he complained of breathing problems. I walked out of the home to get him treated in the hospital. I tried helpline numbers but unfortunately, they failed to respond and I took help from an auto-rickshaw driver to take him to different hospitals in the city,” Renu said.
Before turning to the last resort, Renu single-handedly took her husband to at least four different hospitals. And on reaching SN Medical College, she found the hospital was already at capacity, which forced Renu to breathe into the mouth of her unconscious husband.
“However, I was told bring an oxygen cylinder and he would be admitted as visibly they had no oxygen left,” Renu said.
Despite failing to revive her husband, Renu has set an example of courage in unprecedented times.

Across India, the refusal from hospitals to admit patients has witnessed a surge due to the unavailability of beds. Subsequently, it has forced people to take desperate measures, with many putting out pleas on social media for help.
Crematoriums across the country have also been overwhelmed by the new wave of illness, with facilities forced to spill out into parking lots in order to keep up with the growing number of coronavirus victims.
Haunting photographs have captured families carrying the bodies of their loved ones through the mass cremation sites, with pyres burning around them.
Over past three days, India has reported more than a million COVID-19 infections, which have subsequently overburdened its underdeveloped healthcare institutions.
The second wave of infections has seen most hospitals have run out of oxygen, leading to the deaths of thousands of patients.
On Thursday, India’s daily numbers of COVID-19 cases reached a grim new record, with 379,257 fresh infections and 3645 deaths.
The total number infections across the country has topped 18 million, with more than 204,000 deaths since the pandemic began. However, there are concerns the true figured could be much higher that what is being reported.
The World Health Organisation has announced India is dealing with a “double mutant” strain of the virus called B. 1.617.
WHO recently listed the B. 1.617 mutation as a “variant of interest” but stopped short of declaring it a “variant of concern”, which would label it as more transmissible or deadly than the original.
There is also concern this variant may be combining with other easily spread variants, which could be playing a roll in the record number of cases across India.
“Indeed, studies have highlighted that the spread of the second wave has been much faster than the first,” the WHO said.

Health authorities have revealed how an airport mishap allowed passengers into the wrong zone, potentially exposing almost 400 people to coronavirus.
Queensland authorities are investigating a COVID-19 health breach at Brisbane International Airport. Two travellers from high-risk Papua New Guinea were mistakenly allowed into a &quot;green zone&quot; near hundreds of passengers heading to New Zealand.

An employee at Brisbane International Airport mistakenly directed a returned traveller, who later tested positive to COVID-19, into the wrong area where they mingled with passengers bound for New Zealand.
The airport was dubbed a “venue of concern” after it was revealed the passenger, who had travelled from Papua New Guinea, potentially exposed to the virus to 390 passengers who flew to New Zealand from Brisbane on three separate flights.
The infected man travelled from a “red zone” or high risk country but was inadvertently allowed to cross into the safe “green zone” area at Brisbane Airport, where passengers were waiting to travel to New Zealand.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young revealed the employee mistakenly directed the two travellers into the “green side” path at the airport instead of keeping them in the “red side”.

The infected man and a companion unintentionally spent two hours in the green zone on Thursday morning before they were escorted to their rightful area.
“It was just an error in terms of that staff member, which the Brisbane Airport Corporation has apologised,” Dr Young told reporters on Friday afternoon.
“Errors happen. We know they happen, which is why we have all of those other mitigating factors in place, and they all worked so it was picked up.”
Dr Young said the incident had not led to “any significant risk” and authorities had thoroughly investigated to ensure there were no problems.
The pair dined at Hudson Cafe for about 90 minutes before using the toilets and visiting a second retail outlet.
Staff at the cafe have been asked to isolate for two weeks, but Dr Young said other customers in the cafe did not need to because of the cafe’s open space.

Earlier on Friday, she declared the international terminal a venue of concern.
“Anyone who was in the terminal between 9.45am and midday on Thursday, 29 April 2021, should monitor their symptoms and get tested immediately if they feel unwell.
“Once the mistake was identified, the two passengers were tested for COVID-19.
“One man’s initial test was equivocal, meaning it was neither positive nor negative. Further testing revealed he is positive. The other passenger is negative.”
Dr Young said New Zealand authorities had been alerted to the error and the risk of Queenslanders becoming infected was low.
The three flights affected are Air New Zealand NZ202 from Brisbane to Christchurch, Air New Zealand NZ146 from Brisbane to Auckland, and Qantas QF135 from Brisbane to Christchurch.
“Staff who came into contact with this case have been placed into quarantine,” she said.
“We have advised the NZ Ministry of Health of the latest results, and they are taking their own protection measures.”
Two of today’s new cases were detected in hotel quarantine. One case was detected in Brisbane Airport’s International Terminal. #covid19au
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk took to social media on Friday morning to confirm one of the passengers had tested positive to COVID-19.
The two passengers who arrived on Thursday morning into the red zone were let into the area designated for New Zealand arrivals due to “human error”, Brisbane Airport Corporation confirmed.
They were eventually found by airport staff and returned to the red zone. Three “green” flights departed within the two-hour period to New Zealand, potentially exposing 390 passengers to COVID-19.
The pair had returned negative results before leaving Port Moresby, but a second test on Thursday returned a “weak positive” for one of the travellers.

Dr Young earlier said the two passengers posed a low risk to others.
“While at the airport, they wore masks and socially distanced and neither has reported symptoms,” she said.
“They were in the wrong zone through no fault of their own, and we appreciate their patience and co-operation while we rule them out as cases.
“We’re also grateful for the prompt action by Brisbane Airport staff once the mistake was identified.”
On Thursday night the New Zealand Ministry of Health urged passengers who arrived on flights NZ202 (Brisbane to Christchurch), NZ146 (Brisbane to Auckland) and QF135 (Brisbane to Christchurch) to monitor their health for the next two weeks.
Queensland recorded two cases in hotel quarantine on Friday.

A year ago, a cemetery operator in COVID-ravaged Brazil described his “nightmare”. But 12 months later it is worse than he ever imagined.
The country’s P1 variant is believed to be 150 times more contagious than the original virus.

In April last year, a cemetery operator in COVID-ravaged Brazil described his “nightmare”. Fast forward 12 months and it is much worse.
Last year, at the start of the pandemic, Manual Viana, who looks after the burials of Brazilians at the Nossa Senhora Aparecida cemetery in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, described what it was like to have to dig mass graves for those who did not survive the first wave of coronavirus.
“I just wish a helicopter would come and fly me away from here,” he told Washington-based non-profit media company NPR at the time. “We are living through a nightmare.”
He said the use of heavy machinery to dig mass graves capable of holding multiple coffins was “the only option” because it was “humanly impossible” to stay on top of the rising death toll by hand.
Now, 12 months on, pictures from Mr Viana’s cemetery show graves are being dug in streets because there are no remaining plots to bury the dead.

It is just one sign of Brazil’s ongoing struggle to cope with the pandemic as the country’s death toll surpassed 400,000 on Thursday. It is just the second country to reach the grim milestone after the United States.
Surge in cases pushes health care system to brink of collapse
The country’s health ministry reported 3001 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing Brazil’s overall toll to 401,186.
With a population of 212 million, the South American nation also has one of the highest mortality rates in the pandemic, at 189 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants – the worst in the Americas and one of the top 15 worldwide.
Brazil has been devastated by a surge in cases since the start of the year that pushed hospitals to the brink of collapse in many areas.
Although it appears to have passed the peak of the new wave, the number of daily deaths remains staggeringly high, at an average of 2526 a day over the past week, behind only India.
Experts blame the latest surge partly on the “Brazil variant” of the virus, a mutation that emerged in or around the city of Manaus in December.
The pandemic has now claimed 400,000 lives in Brazil. About one in every 500 Brazilians has died of covid-19.

Known as P1, the variant can reinfect people who have had the original strain of the virus, and may be more contagious.
“P1 has had a very big impact. Nothing was done to contain the variant when there was a spike in January in Manaus. It was only a matter of time before it swept across Brazil,” said epidemiologist Ethel Maciel of Espirito Santo Federal University.
P1 is now circulating in 54 countries, according to the World Health Organisation, which labels it a “variant of concern,” along with the British and South African strains.
Vaccine shortages impact an already struggling nation
The country is meanwhile struggling with vaccine shortages.
Around 28 million people in Brazil have received a first COVID-19 vaccine dose, just over 13 per cent of the population. About 12.7 million have received their second dose.
But cities in 14 of Brazil’s 27 states have had to suspend second doses because of shortages.
In a small piece of good news, the first million doses of the Pfizer vaccine were due to arrive Thursday evening, adding to Brazil’s two current options, the AstraZeneca vaccine and Chinese-developed CoronaVac.
Bolsonaro investigated over handling of health crisis
On Tuesday, the Senate opened an investigation into whether there was criminal neglect in President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic.
The far-right president has controversially downplayed the virus, fought stay-at-home measures to contain it and rejected offers of various vaccines – including, initially, Pfizer’s.
But Mr Bolsonaro refused to accept any blame over the country’s health crisis, telling supporters: “I was wrong about nothing.”
The President argues the economic damage of measures such as a national lockdown would cause more suffering than the virus itself.
But the commission’s rapporteur vowed to hold officials accountable for mishandling the crisis.
Senators will be investigating, among other things, horrific scenes such as those that unfolded earlier this year in Manaus, where dozens of COVID-19 patients suffocated to death due to oxygen shortages.
“The country has the right to know who contributed to these thousands of deaths, and they must be punished immediately,” said the rapporteur, Senator Renan Calheiros.
“There is no statute of limitations on crimes against humanity … We will wage a crusade against this agenda of death.”

President Joe Biden has celebrated his first 100 days in office at a rally in Georgia - touting his achievements in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and job creation. 

 “I promised even before I was sworn in that I would get, in my first 100 days I would get 100 million COVID vaccine shots in people’s arms, we’ve lost over 550,000 Americans but we’ve delivered over 220 million COVID shots in the first 100 days,” he said.

“We’ve vastly expanded access, we’ve got 100 million doses of vaccine, enough for every single American and we’ve done it by getting vaccines to some 40,000 pharmacies across the country, 700 community centres, and now, everyone over the age of 16 is eligible to get vaccinated right away.”

Tasmanian Opposition Leader Rebecca White told Sky News COVID-19 is not the single issue which will decide the state election since jobs, affordable housing and healthcare are also in focus.   

“That’s certainly not the one issue that people are raising with me every single day and it’s certainly been this way for a while now,” she said.

“Tasmania’s been fortunate to be an island off the beautiful big island that we haven’t had the same sort of outbreaks of COVID that you’ve experienced there, so people here have been focused on other issues.

“It is about access to affordable housing, it is about whether they can get a job, it is about whether they can access healthcare and they are the issues that people, I believe, will be voting on tomorrow."

A record day of COVID019 cases has pushed India’s infections to 18 million. But many fear this number is hiding something much worse.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.

Days of record COVID-19 infections and deaths have seen India reach a grim milestone, with the country topping 18 million cases, but experts believe this figure is hiding a much worse crisis.
In the past three days India recorded one million infections, with the nation experiencing a new single-day record on Thursday after confirming 379,257 cases and 3645 deaths.
The country’s official COVID-19 figures stand at almost 18.4 million cases and 204,832 fatalities, though researchers and health workers have warned the true numbers are much higher.
Some experts have estimated the cases and deaths are likely between five and 10 times higher than what is being reported, while others believe it could be up to 30 times higher.
Scientists have been using serology surveys to get a more accurate measure of infection rates, with a previous national survey showing the number of cases in India is likely “20 to 30 times higher than what had been reported.

RELATED: Unfolding virus crisis we’re overlooking
Applying this to India’s latest figures raises the estimated total infections for the country to 540 million cases, more than half a billion infections.
Director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi, Ramanan Laxminarayan, told CNN it was “widely known” the case numbers and death toll were being under-reported.
“Last year we estimated that only one in about 30 infections were being caught by testing, so the reported cases are a serious underestimate of true infections,” he said.
“This time, the mortality figures are probably serious underestimates, and what we’re seeing on the ground is many more deaths than what has been officially reported.”
Crematoriums and hospitals overflowing
The situation in crematoriums across the country is also pointing to a much higher death toll than what is being officially reported.
Mass cremations are taking place in multiple cities, with the facilities being forced to spill out into parking lots and on roads in order to keep up with the constant stream of COVID-19 victims.
There have been multiple reports of discrepancies in the numbers being reported by crematoriums and the number of cremations actually taking place.
On April 17, the state of Gujarat claimed 78 COVID-19 deaths but newspapers reported 689 cremations linked to the virus took place across seven of the state’s cities that same day.
Similar complaints have also surfaced in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Indian journalist Rana Ayyub described the country’s situation as “apocalyptic”.

Suresh Bhai, a worker at one of the large cremation grounds in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, told The New York Times he had been instructed by his bosses to write “sickness” instead of COVID-19 on the documentation handed over to families of victims.
The situation India’s hospitals is just as grim, with patients gasping for breath due to the serious undersupply of oxygen.
Families are being forced to put out plea for help on social media, begging for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders in an attempt to save their loved ones.
More than 40 countries have committed to sending vital medical aid to the country, however, the oxygen crisis is still expected to continue into mid-May.
India’s crisis a warning to the rest of the world
As the situation in India worsens, the World Health Organisation has issued a stark warning to countries thinking of easing COVID-19 restrictions.
Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin announced plans to lift lockdown restrictions starting May 10, including “vaccine bonus” perks for those who have had both jabs.
“Hope is returning,” Martin said.
Portugal said it would reopen its land border with Spain on Saturday.
In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city hopes to “fully reopen” on July 1.
And in France, cafes, cultural venues and business will reopen in several phases from next month, President Emmanuel Macron said.
WHO has warned relaxing restrictions too quickly could spark a “perfect storm” for a new wave of infections across the US and Europe.
“When personal protective measures are being relaxed, when there are mass gatherings, when there are more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low this can create a perfect storm in any country,” head of WHO Europe, Hans Kluge, told reporters Thursday.
“It is very important to realise that the situation in India can happen anywhere.”
‘Double mutant’ variant blamed as vaccines ramp up
India’s second wave has been blamed on a new “double mutant” COVID-19 variant called B. 1.617, with officials suggesting continued mass gatherings across the country are partly to blame for allowing the variant to spread so quickly.
WHO recently listed the B. 1.617 mutation as a “variant of interest” but stopped short of declaring it a “variant of concern”, which would label it as more transmissible or deadly than the original.
There is also concern this variant may be combining with other easily spread variants, which could be playing a roll in the record number of cases across India.
“Indeed, studies have highlighted that the spread of the second wave has been much faster than the first,” the WHO said.
The Indian government is planning to tackle this crisis by ramping up its vaccination program, announcing vaccinations will be open to all adults from Saturday. It had previously limited shots to the over-45s and certain other groups.
However, despite the country being home to the world’s largest vaccine producer, the Serum Institute of India, many states believe they won’t have enough stock to expand the rollout.
About 140 million of India’s 1.4 billion population has received a COVID-19 vaccine, with under two per cent of those receiving both doses.

The United States is looking to help India quickly and sharply scale up oxygen supplies available for Covid patients as it rushes in aid, officials said Thursday.
"I think we're cognizant that that's a sort of stopgap approach and we also need to support them to address some of the underlying challenges, which is really about the volume of medical-grade oxygen that the country can produce," he told AFP. The United States is in talks with India on identifying how to expand the "oxygen supply chain" including developing the technologies to convert industrial-grade oxygen for medical use and improving ways to transport it throughout the country.

Travel arrangements from high-risk COVID-19 countries will top the agenda today at the National Cabinet meeting after the federal government banned flights from India for at least two weeks. 

Anyone wanting to travel to Australia will need to provide a negative PCR test within 72 hours before boarding their flight. 

The National Cabinet will also discuss the status of the vaccine rollout.

Meanwhile, some premiers have made it clear to the federal government they want greater support for their quarantine programs. 

Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said he did not want a costly, purpose-built quarantine facility – pointing to federal government properties such as defence facilities or detention facilities on Christmas Island as an alternative. 

The Victorian government, however, suggested a purpose-built quarantine facility able to house up to 500 people to be constructed in north Melbourne. 

The proposal also included the federal government paying for the facility. 

Commenting on the plan, Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said, “we’re willing to work through the detailed options that they’ve put forward which are a bit of a contrast to some of the ideas that have come from the other states”. 

“Victoria has to their credit gone through a process and put forward some detail around their proposals. 

“There won’t be any quick responses the next day to something that we’ve only just received and is as significant as what they’ve come up with.”

A father’s harrowing last words before he died from COVID are revealed as death predictions in India worsen. WARNING: Distressing images
Journalist, Barkha Dutt speaks about her own father's last moments and the devastation in India.

WARNING: Distressing images
A woman has shared the harrowing last words of her father as he died from coronavirus in India.
The country has been setting global record daily case numbers as devastating stories and images emerge from the epicentre and its surrounds. New Delhi is now reporting one death every four minutes.
Today is the eight-straight day of record figures and experts say that’s not likely to stop, as medical supplies dwindle and delayed safety measures have caused strife for containing the spread.
Figures are expected to continue to peak for the next few weeks as cases spiral.
Almost 400,000 new cases were confirmed yesterday, more than 30,000 above the 7-day average. At least 3600 people died in the last 24 hours, taking India’s total COVID-19 cases pass 18 million.
“India is still on an upward trajectory where the rate of infection is still moving at very fast and very horrifying rates at the moment,” ABC’s South Asia correspondent James Oaten said from New Delhi.

Barkha Dutt’s father was among the dead yesterday, with the Washington Post columnist telling CNN he died after the oxygen tank in the ambulance that was rushing him to hospital ran out.
“My father’s last words to me were: ‘I’m choking, please give me treatment’,” she said.
“I have nobody left, I feel alone.”
Ms Dutt said that despite being an “upper-middle class Indian who can pay for the best private medical treatment”, the shortage of supplies knew no bounds.
“By the time we reached hospital, he had to be taken into ICU. He never made it back.”
She said when the family went to cremate his body, “there was no space” and a there was a “physical fight that erupted between families”.
The spiking body count has overwhelmed crematoriums and graveyards, and caused a shortage of wood for funeral pyres.
Ms Dutt said she met families at cremation grounds where “bodies were lying on the floor”.
Horror prediction, gravediggers work
Experts suggest current data predicts deaths in India could peak at up to 14,000 a day.
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle has predicted that the death toll will continue to rise, peaking at almost 14,000 on May 16.
Director Dr Christopher Murray warned “there’s a lot of bad times ahead” for India as infections are close to their peak next week.
The Indian government has been criticised for its lacklustre handling of the spread of the virus, with political rallies and religious festivals allowed across the country.
It’s a blow for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who just months ago claimed the country had defeated the virus and concerns grow of the government’s level of transparency over official figures.
Dr Murray told CNN the appearance of new COVID-19 variants have increased transmission and meant that people could be reinfected with a new strain.
Meanwhile, gravediggers are “working around the clock”, doing 24-hour shifts in Mumbai to bury victims while hundreds more were being cremated in parks and car parks in New Delhi that have been converted to crematoriums.

‘Unprecedented situation’
A number of flights carrying medical supplies worth almost $130 million are en route to India after more than 40 countries, including Australia, committed to sending vital medical aid to the country, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said overnight.
|But many countries have come forward on their own to offer us assistance,” Mr Shringla said.
The supplies include almost 550 oxygen-generating plants, more than 4000 oxygen concentrators, 10,000 oxygen cylinders as well as 17 cryogenic tankers.
Hundreds of thousands of doses of COVID-19 treatment drugs remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, as well as raw materials to produce vaccines and remdesivir, were also being sent.
“It is an unprecedented situation … we are sourcing many of these items from many countries,” Mr Shringla said.

Oxygen supplies are among the most sought after supplies amid a severe shortage, but the equipment, sent from the United States, Europe and Singapore to name a few, is “really more a trickle than a flood compared to India’s huge population,” Mr Oaten said.
“This is a collapsed health care system and people just can’t get into hospitals,” he said.
Despite this, the Indian government will open vaccinations to all adults from Saturday. It had previously limited shots to the over-45s and certain other groups.
Several states have warned, however, that they do not have sufficient vaccine stocks and the expanded rollout is threatened by administrative bickering, confusion over prices and technical glitches on the government’s digital vaccine platform.
“The queues here are so colossal,” Jayanti Vasant told AFP as he waited at a busy vaccination centre in Bangalore.
“The people are just fighting amongst themselves.”

Pallets of oxygen cylinders were packaged to leave Travis Air Force Base in California on April 27, headed for India, where a second wave of coronavirus has seen hospitals struggle. The White House said the US would supply India with more than $100 million worth of “urgent relief.” Officials said aid flights would arrive from April 29 in India, carrying, besides oxygen, protective personal equipment (PPE), vaccine manufacturing supplies, and rapid diagnostic tests.

WA’s Mark McGowan has announced eased restrictions from Saturday after a snap lockdown — but the new rules have caused some confusion.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended hotel quarantine in its current form as high-profile political figures in Queensland and Western Australia call for a federal facility. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan have both spoken in favour of federal facilities after breaches in their own state-run quarantine programs. However, Mr Morrison hit back at such suggestions while in Darwin and pointed out hotel quarantine had a 99.99 per cent efficacy rate in containing the virus. “The success rate of containing breaches in the hotel quarantine network is 99.99 per cent. Now I’d say that’s a pretty impressive stat. Here in Howard Spring’s it’s 100 per cent,” he said

West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has revealed eased COVID-19 restrictions from Saturday after a snap lockdown in Perth and Peel — but the new rules have some scratching their heads.
The Premier said interim measures, including mandatory masks indoors, would remain in place for a week until 12.01am Saturday May 8.
“We just need to get through this next week to make sure the virus is not lingering in our community,” he said during a press conference on Thursday evening.
Masks will remain mandatory at indoor workplaces and on public transport, while indoor private gatherings will be capped at 30 people, Mr McGowan revealed. Teachers and high school students will also have to wear masks, but gyms, nightclubs and casinos will be able to reopen under the new rules.

“I know wearing masks is annoying and frustrating for many people but I just ask that we keep following the health advice and keep using common sense,” he said.
Spectators will be permitted at outdoor sporting events including the AFL western derby at Perth Stadium on Sunday, although the crowd will be capped at 75 per cent capacity, around 45,000 people.
Indoor weddings and funerals will be permitted with up to 200 guests, and nightclubs will be allowed to open under the four-square-metre rule. Indoor fitness venues, dance studios and gyms can reopen, but will need to abide by mask requirements.
The new rules caused confusion on social media, with some criticising the decisions.
“Wait, did Mark McGowan just say nightclubs can open but masks will be mandatory? Uhh,” wrote one Twitter user.
Tonight I am able to announce the changes to restrictions which will occur at midnight tomorrow night, 12.01am Saturday 1 May, with the majority of interim restrictions set to lift immediately.For more information, please see this post: https://t.co/Y5KqAtdeWGpic.twitter.com/fM69l80Cnt

“Why the F should we be wearing masks when there are NO active cases in the community? This BS is getting beyond a joke,” said another.
“How does it make any sense that I have to wear a mask because covid is so transmissible but at the same time the derby can have 45,000 people in a stadium,” read another comment.
But others defended the Premier against the critics, with one resident saying they were “really sick of all the moaners complaining about Mark McGowan, masks and other health measures”, adding: “Some people don’t know how lucky we are.”
The WA Premier confirmed that the state had recorded no new local cases and that nearly all close and casual contacts of COVID cases had returned negative test results.
“Of the 399 close contacts, all have now returned a negative result, and of the 899 casual contacts, 800 returned a negative result.
“All things going well, these few restrictions will only be in place for seven days.”
He also announced grants of up to $2000 for small businesses worst affected by the pandemic, such as those in the hospitality sector.
Initial treasury estimates indicate a $70 million hit to the state’s economy from shutting down for three days over the long weekend.

A long line of ambulances waited outside a crematorium in Bengaluru, India, on April 29, as COVID deaths in the country mounted. This footage was captured by Zameer Baig, a local volunteer, at the Panathur Crematorium in Bengaluru. Baig said he arrived at the crematorium at 9:30 am and was still waiting by 4 pm. He said, “I spoke to management inside, they told me it will be done by 11 pm, or else tomorrow morning.” He said he was expecting to break his Ramadan fast while waiting outside the crematorium. The crematorium is one of seven that have been allocated to exclusively serve victims of COVID-19 in the area, according to local media. According to Baig, 15 ambulances were waiting outside the crematorium. He said four ambulances had left to go to a different crematorium due to the long wait. Baig is a volunteer with the local organization Mercy Angels, and helps with the burial or cremation of people who died of COVID-19, local media reported. He told Storyful that people had left their “loved ones in the ambulances, because [they are] afraid of infection”. India recorded 379,257 new cases of COVID-19 on April 29.

Aussie cricket stars Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson have landed safe back in Australia after fleeing COVID-19-ravaged India despite Prime Minister Scott Morrison shutting the border to the country on Tuesday.
The two cricketers, who had been playing in India’s rich Indian Premier League, have exposed a staggering loophole in the system that has allowed them to side-step the border protection measures.
Flights to and from India into Australia were suspended this week amid increasing concerns over the nation’s escalating COVID-19 situation.
“We recognise that this has been a very significant outbreak in India,” the Prime Minister told reporters, off the back of a national security committee meeting on Tuesday.
“Today we agreed, in addition to the measures that I announced after the last National Cabinet meeting, to pause direct passenger flights between India and Australia until the 15th of May.”

On Thursday, India recorded 380,000 cases – the worst single-day increase in any country since the pandemic began – as mass cremation sites were established in response to a mounting death toll.
There were fears for Richardson and Zampa after it was revealed Tuesday night the pair failed to beat the Australian border closure to India. Both players surrendered rich six-figure contracts to pull-out of the IPL biosecurity bubble in a desperate attempt to dash home at the last second.
They were left stranded in Mumbai and were uncertain as to whether they would be able to get home via a third destination.
But despite this, the pair landed in Melbourne on Thursday afternoon, having used a loophole to return home via a connecting flight through Doha.
Morrison clarified in Tuesday’s announcement that the Government was advised gateway destinations, including Doha, Dubai, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, had also suspended all travel to and from India, making the India lockdown near watertight.
“So that third country entry point into Australia has already been closed by those key embarkation points to Australia,” he said.

“That will obviously have impacts, in a positive way, in terms of restricting the inflow and in fact in most cases eliminating it.”
Zampa and Richardson have now started their 14-days in hotel quarantine.
Their controversial arrival was confirmed by a report by abc.net.au which revealed Qatar Airways is still able to transport Australian people home from India via Doha.
“You can still travel outbound from India through Doha and on to Australia with the right documentation,” a spokesperson for Qatar Airways said in the report.
“PCR test 48 hours prior to flight is now mandatory for any [passengers] to transit/arrive in Doha.”
Fellow Aussie cricketer Andrew Tye earlier this week got in before Morrison’s announcement, returning home to Australia and begin his two weeks in quarantine in Sydney.
There are still 12 Aussies including David Warner, Steve Smith and Pat Cummins, as well as a handful of coaches such as Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich, still in India.
Morrison said on Tuesday Aussie cricketers would not receive any preferential treatment when the suspension of direct flights from India is reviewed after May 15.
It came after Aussie batting star Chris Lynn called for Cricket Australia to facilitate a charter flight out of the country for all the Australians involved with the cricket tournament, which does not conclude until the end of May.

Rugby Australia’s chairman has warned stakeholders and fans that 2021 will be “a very testing time” for the skint 15-man code.

Rugby Australia ran at a $27.1 million loss in 2020, with officials pointing the finger at “significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic” in a statement released on Thursday.
Chairman Hamish McLennan said Rugby Australia was “shaken to its core” by the pandemic, which was responsible for a staggering $45.7 million reduction in revenue during the 2020 calendar year.
“Australian Rugby has been through some challenging years recently, but nothing could have prepared us for 2020,” McLennan said.
“It has been an extraordinary job just to survive. We will carry a very weak balance sheet into this year, in what will be a very testing time. This only highlights the importance of external investment as we look to alternate sources of funding to reinvest back into the game.”

RA’s statement detailed the measures taken by the organisation to cut its budget in response to the pandemic.
In 2020, staff costs were reduced by $9.9m (down 46%) and player costs by $7.7m (down 45%). In addition, Member Union funding was cut by $8.1m (down 28%) while all other costs were slashed by $5.5m.
Despite the code’s financial harships, McLennan insists there were positives to be taken from 2020, pointing to the reinstatement of the Western Force to the Super League, RA’s broadcast deal with Nine and Stan and a retention of $15.4 million in sponsorship.
“I’m very excited about what the future has in store for our game in this country, as is everyone that I speak to on the street. The reset button was pressed and we’re well on our way to reaping those rewards,” he said.
“The work is not yet done though. We have some incredibly important decisions to make in the near future which will ensure Australian Rugby returns to its lofty heights.”
New Zealand Rugby posted a similarly large loss on Thursday. The organisation’s $A31.6 million loss accounted for a 26 per cent decline in revenue, compared to RA’s 41 per cent.

Sky News host Rita Panahi says "being an Australian citizen should mean something" and at the very least "should mean your country comes to your assistance at a time of crisis".

"The Australian government has turned its back on around 9,000 citizens stranded in India," she said.

"If Australian citizens are willing to undergo two weeks of quarantine, and be billed for the expense, plus undergo COVID-19 tests before being released, then every effort should be made to facilitate their prompt return home. 

"Prime Minister Scott Morrison's decision to halt all flights from India until at least May 15 will no doubt be popular with many voters. Throughout this pandemic, we've seen scaremongering and irrational fears cloud people's judgment and sense of compassion."

Ms Panahi said having Australian citizens die in a foreign country "would amount to a shameful dereliction of duty".

A major alert has been issued after a potential virus breach at Brisbane Airport involving passengers who’d flown in from a high-risk country.
Queensland authorities are investigating a COVID-19 health breach at Brisbane International Airport. Two travellers from high-risk Papua New Guinea were mistakenly allowed into a &quot;green zone&quot; near hundreds of passengers heading to New Zealand.

Authorities have sent out an urgent health alert following a major COVID-19 breach at Brisbane Airport.
An investigation has been launched after two passengers on a red flight from Papua New Guinea were let into a green zone of the airport.
The pair dined at the airport’s Hudson Cafe for about an hour and half, before using the toilets and visiting a second retail outlet.
An initial review of CCTV indicates that the red zone passengers were allowed into the green zone at 9:55am, spending just under two hours there before they were found by Brisbane Airport staff and returned to the red zone.
In a statement Brisbane Airport said it was working with authorities to investigate the circumstances of the breach.
BAC confirms there was a breach of the ‘green zone’ at the Brisbane Airport International Terminal today. This was due to human error, for which we unreservedly apologise. We are working with all relevant authorities to investigate the circumstances.  https://t.co/pFFhg2t0NG
“BAC is conducting a thorough investigation and unreservedly apologises for this human error,” the statement read.
“Thorough cleaning of all areas mentioned above has since been conducted, and we can confirm all workers and passengers within the green area were wearing PPE.”
Three ‘green’ flights departed within this two-hour period to New Zealand, with approximately 390 passengers on these services.
At this stage, it is believed only a handful of passengers on these New Zealand flights were in the vicinity of the two ‘red’ passengers at any time.
PNG has battled a surging COVID-19 outbreak over the past month, as health authorities grapple with a fragile health system and slow and limited testing.
The country reported a high of 368 cases on April 22, with infections slowly dropping to 80 cases on April 28.
The pair, who travelled from Port Moresby, returned negative results before leaving from their home country, but a second test result from swabs taken on Thursday has returned a weak positive for one of the tests.

Queensland Health is leading the health response to the incident and working with the New Zealand Ministry of Health.
The three flights affected are Air New Zealand NZ202 from Brisbane to Christchurch, Air New Zealand NZ146 from Brisbane to Auckland, and Qantas QF135 from Brisbane to Christchurch.
QLD Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said the two passengers posed a low risk to others.
“While at the airport, they wore masks and socially distanced and neither has reported symptoms,” Dr Young said.
“They were in the wrong zone through no fault of their own and we appreciate their patience and cooperation while we rule them out as cases.
“We’re also grateful for the prompt action by Brisbane airport staff once the mistake was identified.”
Queensland Health will release the results of the confirmatory testing once it is available.
Meanwhile the New Zealand Ministry of Health urged affected passengers to monitor their health for the next 14 days.
“Each plane has been met by officials who provided information to passengers alerting them to the potential breach and providing advice about monitoring their health for the next two weeks and contacting Healthline and getting tested if symptoms develop,” the Ministry said in a statement.

More than 200 people in Victorian suburbs have been told to urgently get tested due to ‘strong and unexpected’ COVID-19 results.
Everyone knows the main COVID-19 symptoms to look out for, but experts have found two new indicators you may have the virus.

More than 200 Victorians have been told to urgently get tested for coronavirus, as the state reports a sudden and unexpected surge of viral fragments in wastewater.
Authorities have contacted 246 people living in Melbourne’s western and northwestern suburbs, who have been urged to get tested as a precaution.
Dozens of new suburbs in the city were listed as at-risk on Thursday night, adding to the growing list of suburbs where COVID-19 fragments have been found in recent days.
Although the department initially said the detection of fragments was likely due to viral shedding after the infectious period, stronger action was necessary because a known positive COVID-19 case had been in the community.
“This additional action is being taken due to the strength of the wastewater detection and because a known positive COVID-19 case, from flight QF778, has been in Victoria in the past 14 days,” Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said.
“In response to strong and unexpected COVID-19 fragment wastewater detections reported yesterday in Melbourne’s western and northwestern suburbs, 246 people who were in those areas have been contacted and are being asked to be tested as a precaution.”

Those being tested include four primary close contacts of an infected man who flew from Perth to Victoria on April 21, as well as 242 recently returned red and orange zone travel permit holders.
All of those primary close contacts had recently been tested and all returned negative results, but the department has asked them to get tested again out of an abundance of caution.
COVID-19 fragments have been detected in four additional catchments in Melbourne’s western, northern, northwestern, and outer eastern suburbs, and there have been repeat detections in Benalla.
These are in addition to viral fragment detections reported over recent days in other catchments the eastern, western, northwestern and outer northern suburbs.
“It is most likely that these new detections are due to a person or persons continuing to shed the virus after the infection period however, it could also be due to a person living in or travelling through the area in the early active infectious phase,” Professor Sutton said.
“The wastewater testing program is designed as an early warning system to support our ongoing efforts in continuing to protect the COVIDSafe environment we have achieved and therefore a cautious approach is always taken when these detections are found.”

The head of the Therapeutic Goods Association Professor John Skerritt says current evidence does not suggest a “likely association” between the COVID-19 vaccine and two clotting events over the past days.

Professor Skerritt said he cautioned the public and media against “reaching any conclusion” on the two fatalities.

The TGA and the Health Department conducted an investigation into the two clotting deaths in NSW from a man in his 50s and a man in his 70s, and Professor Skerritt said the evidence suggested no likely association between the vaccine and the deaths.

“Fifty Australians each day report to hospitals of the doctors with serious blood clots from a range of activities,” Professor Skerritt said.

“Sometimes a blood clot can kill you within minutes, other times it may kill you weeks later if it is a very serious and potentially fatal one.

“It's important to realise that we're not seeing a flood of these serious cases.

“I think why it is important to emphasise that sadly, 3,000 people die every week, sadly 50 people get serious clotting disorders every day and perhaps a third of them die immediately or as soon after.

“We have a shared responsibility whether we are government or civil service, the community or media, for providing accurate, unbiased information on benefits and also on risks.”

Shocking footage from the doorstep of a hospital in COVID-ravaged India has revealed the nation’s terrifying new low. WARNING: Distressing
India's toll from the coronavirus surged past 200,000 on Wednesday, and passed another daily death toll record of almost 3,300 killed, as shortages of oxygen, medical supplies and hospital staff continued. Video contains graphic content. Lucy Fielder reports.

WARNING: Distressing content
Footage from the doorstep of a hospital in India represents a new low for a nation ravaged by the coronavirus.
Video from King George Hospital in the southeastern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh shows a 16-month-old baby girl dying in the back of a van while her father desperately pumps oxygen into her lungs by hand.
Her mother screams and cries for help but no help comes. The little girl, who local reporters say tested positive for COVID-19, died 90 minutes after the video was recorded.
Filmmaker Uma Sudhim from Indian news media company New Delhi Television Ltd shared the distressing moments on Twitter.
“A mother wailing/pleading in front of King George Hospital asking for admission & treatment for her 16-month old baby girl who reportedly tested (positive for COVID-19); she says ‘we don’t want bed, just treat my baby’; baby died after 90 minutes at doorstep of (hospital),” she wrote.
“Father constantly pressing (ambulance) bag to keep his baby alive as he says baby first tested negative in rapid antigen test, then tested positive, she was denied treatment in hospitals & brought to biggest & govt hospital but died without treatment.”

The baby girl is one of a countless number of victims who have died outside hospitals while waiting for emergency care and oxygen as India’s healthcare system collapses under the weight of an unprecedented second wave.
India on Thursday recorded a new record rise in coronavirus cases with 379,257 and 3645 deaths, taking the country’s overall cases to 18 million.
India’s death toll also rose above 200,000 according to health ministry data, however, experts fear the actual death toll could be much higher.
Help is on its way in the form of $100 million in supplies from the US, including nearly one million instant tests.
The White House said the first lot would arrive on Thursday in New Delhi via a military plane, days after President Joe Biden promised to step up assistance to the emerging US ally.
The first shipment includes 960,000 rapid tests, which can detect COVID-19 in 15 minutes, and 100,000 N95 masks for frontline health workers.

The US is also sending 1000 refillable oxygen cylinders and 1700 concentrators that produce oxygen for patients from the air.
Nations have rushed supplies to India as it contends with one of the world’s most catastrophic surges of COVID-19 since the pandemic began, overwhelming hospitals and pushing crematoriums past capacity.
In the last week, India has recorded more than 300,000 new cases every day.
The problem with oxygen is very real, even though experts say the vast nation of 1.3 billion people is producing enough oxygen — just over 7000 tonnes a day. Most is for industrial use, but can be diverted for medical purposes.
The bottlenecks are in transport and storage.
Liquid oxygen at very low temperatures has to be transported in cryogenic tankers to distributors, which then convert it into gas for filling cylinders. But India is short of cryogenic tankers.
The government is importing mobile oxygen generation plants and tankers, building more than 500 new plants and buying portable oxygen concentrators.

Industries have been ordered by the government not to use liquid oxygen. Oxygen supplies are being brought to hard-hit regions using special train services.
The military has also been mobilised to transport tankers and other supplies domestically and from international sources.
Emergency medical supplies — including liquid oxygen, cryogenic tankers, concentrators and ventilators — are being flown in from other countries in a huge aid effort.
Oxygen shortages are still affecting badly-hit regions despite the measures to boost supply, transport and storage.
Reports have emerged of hospitals asking patients to arrange for their own cylinders and of people dying even after being admitted due to low oxygen supplies.
Social media platforms have been filled with posts by desperate families hunting for cylinders and refills.
Meanwhile, there is a growing black market for cylinders and concentrators sold far above their usual retail prices.

President Joe Biden told Congress that after Covid-19, the US must turn to rebuilding the middle class
Security has been at top level around the Capitol building since the January 6 riot staged by former president Donald Trump's supportersSource:AFP
President Joe Biden&nbsp;triumphantly declared that the United States is &quot;on the move again&quot; in a rousing speech to Congress Wednesday, calling for trillions of dollars to rebuild the post-pandemic US middle class and give new life to &quot;forgotten&quot; workers.
Lauding the success of mass vaccination against Covid-19, Biden told Congress and the nation on primetime television that "in America, we always get up."
Biden, who was celebrating the eve of his 100th day in office, called the vaccine rollout one of "the greatest logistical achievements" in US history.
In a line that could have come from his populist Republican predecessor Donald Trump, Biden said working-class Americans had been ignored, while the top one percent got richer, and that his plans would give them a chance.
- No more solo America -
On foreign policy he underlined Washington's return to international partnerships damaged under Trump.
Among his many references to arch-rival China, Biden said that while Beijing is seeking supremacy, "we welcome the competition" and "are not looking for conflict."
"We have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve -- to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system," Biden said, urging the Senate to pass a police reform bill already approved in the House.
But Republicans showed little sign of listening to Biden's appeals for unity, accusing him of only paying lip service to the idea, while promoting a leftist agenda.
"President Biden promised you a specific type of leadership," he said. "Three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further and further apart."
US presidents usually bend over backwards to avoid or at least hide tax increases.
The plan, which will need approval by a deeply divided Congress, would pour money into early education, childcare and higher education.
The Biden plan would also end loopholes and capital income tax breaks, while raising "billions," according to the White House, in a tightened tax regime for inherited wealth.
"My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out," Biden said. "What I've proposed is fair."
- Extraordinary times -
Security has been at top level around the Capitol building since the January 6 riot when Trump supporters rampaged against what the Republican falsely claims was a stolen election.
Instead of a House chamber crammed with the usual 1,600 or so politicians and guests, Biden looked out on a select group of around 200.
Only the secretaries of defense and state were in the room, meaning that the tradition of nominating a "designated survivor" -- someone who could take over the country if the entire government died while inside the Capitol -- was not necessary.

Joe Biden lays out “ambitious visions” however Republicans view his words as “empty platitudes,” according to US Studies Centre non-resident fellow James Brown.

President Biden recently gave his first major address to a joint sitting of Congress, declaring America is “on the move again”.

He spoke on issues relating to national security, climate change, COVID-19, and even called on Congress to work with the White House and “end cancer as we know it”.

According to Mr Brown, the most interesting part of Biden’s speech was the “core Democratic Party values” which the president tried to lay out in the economic recovery plan.

“A lot of references to unions, and indeed talking about some legislation that he wants Congress to deliver him to make union operations easier,” he told Sky News.

“This was a speech playing very much to his base and laying out a very ambitious vision”.

However, Joe Biden has laid out ambitious visions before – he spoke about ending cancer in his address, but he talked about ending cancer “five years ago as the vice president of the United States,” according to Mr Brown.

“So of course, the Republicans can say: 'great words, but at the end of the day these are just going to be empty platitudes’.”

International Development and the Pacific Minister Zed Seselja says the COVID-19 outbreak in Papua New Guinea is still a “very challenging situation” but progress is being made.

The Commonwealth government has taken an active role in assisting the pacific nation including negotiating with the EU to lift a blockade on one million vaccines which will be sent to PNG.

Mr Seselja told Sky News PNG provided an “ongoing challenge” but the main test was to lift the vaccination rates.

“It’s still a very challenging situation and there’s a long way to go, but progress is being made,” he said.

An alarming statistic has shown how heavily the hotel sector has been hammered by COVID-19, and the industry is begging for help.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has touted the Morrison government's economic strategy during his pre-budget address saying the nation is set to avoid 'what many feared would be another lost generation to long-term unemployment'. Mr Frydenberg said the nation's 'sound economic position' pre-pandemic enabled it to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 'as required'. 'Now, beyond all expectations, after the first recession in nearly 30 years, employment has not only returned to its pre-COVID level, it has surpassed it,' he said. 'There are more Australians in work today than ever before.' 'As a direct result of our actions, Australia has experienced a smaller fall in economic activity than any major advanced economy. 'And we are the first major advanced economy to see both hours worked and employment, return to pre-pandemic levels'. The treasurer said the upcoming budget will 'continue to prioritise job creation and drive the unemployment rate even lower,' and 'ensure Australia's fiscal position remains strong and sustainable'.

Hotel and accommodation operators have begged for help, claiming COVID-19 has slashed occupancy rates in CBDs by half.
Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Thursday also heard “anecdotal evidence” of significant job losses in the sector following the end of JobKeeper.
Tourism Accommodation Australia chief executive Michael Johnson said the industry had no federal or state safety net to help it cope with the impact of snap lockdowns.
“This has a devastating financial, emotional, and mental cost to businesses and workers,” he said.
“Many workers have found alternative employment in other industries less exposed to the impacts of COVID-19.”

Australia has enjoyed a strong economic recovery from COVID-19, and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday noted that 200,000 more people than initial estimates had found work.
But Mr Johnson said 15 per cent of workers in the hotel sector in NSW had been laid off since March, adding to the 25 per cent let go at the beginning of the pandemic.
Cuts had come mainly from administrative roles that operators could no longer justify, but the sector faced “dire” shortages in kitchen and frontline food skills, he said.
“So we’ve got this huge need for people. On the other side of it, we’ve had some highly skilled people that have left and gone to other industries,” he said.
Mr Johnson said in Sydney and Melbourne’s CBDs, which were heavily reliant on corporate travel, occupancy rates were around 50 per cent.
“The concern is that if (people) do travel and there is a shutdown, they then get restricted or placed into a quarantine environment,” he said.
“We’re still seeing a very, very slow recovery of corporate travel, and the corporate market makes up a huge proportion of our domestic travel.”
Australian Hotels Association ACT general manager Anthony Brierley said unemployment was at “virtually 100 per cent” in the sector at the beginning of the pandemic.

Mr Brierley said the federal government’s $80bn JobKeeper scheme had eased that pain but agreed there would be “significant job losses” after it ended last month.
“That’s the anecdotal evidence. I think the ABS data will bear that out in time,” he said.
He predicted unemployment would remain at roughly 11 per cent, equating to around 100,000 jobs.
Mr Brierley also warned that hotel operators’ fixed costs, including rent and mortgages, had returned to or exceeded their pre-pandemic levels.
Coupled with capacity limits, he said the situation for operators had become “unsustainable”.
“Our industry is being asked to do these things with only 50 per cent of its patrons. That’s not fair. It’s not sustainable in a financial sense,” he said.
Mr Brierley said targeted assistance from the federal government had previously worked to plug holes caused by snap lockdowns, but was that was no longer the case.
“There’s a breakdown there and our industry is caught in the middle of it, and people seem to be oblivious to the financial plight that comes with that,” he said.

Trains carrying tanker trucks filled with liquid oxygen travelled from Bokaro, Jharkhand, to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, late on April 28, according to India’s railways minister. This footage, released by Piyush Goyal, shows the “Oxygen Express” service travelling at night from Bokaro to the capital of Uttar Pradesh, as hospitals struggled to meet the demand for oxygen from COVID-19 patients. In a separate tweet, Goyal said more than 510 metric tonnes (562 tons) of liquid medical oxygen had now been delivered to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Delhi. On Wednesday, India’s Ministry of Health reported 360,960 new cases of COVID-19 and 3,293 deaths in the last 24 hours. Credit: Piyush Goyal via Storyful

President Joe Biden has used his first major address to a joint sitting in Congress to warn that America's democracy will continue to be the dominance force in the 21st century.

President Biden outlined a slew of policies in his address and vowed to work with Democrats and Republicans to deliver his ambitious agenda.

The address on Wednesday was President Biden’s first and came a day before he marked 100 days in office.

Normally a joint session has 1,600 people however just 200 people attended due to COVID-19 restrictions.

"As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds," President Biden said.

"The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people?

"Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart?America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t.

"They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage.

"They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.

They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong."

We spent months cooped up indoors during COVID-19 lockdowns. Now, not only are our cities and regions coming alive again – we’re being given free money to go out and enjoy them.
State and territory government are releasing vouchers to residents to redeem as discounts on tourism, dining, arts and entertainment experiences to support those industries doing it tough.
It’s essentially a day or night out, or a few nights away, on the government’s coin.
Voucher schemes vary from state to state – in some cases, every adult resident can claim them, while in others, you have to be a lucky winner.
Here’s a breakdown of the voucher schemes currently on offer across Australia.
Dine and Discover vouchers are available to all NSW residents over 18. Picture: Jenifer JagielskiSource:News Corp Australia
NSW Dine and Discover
Every NSW resident aged 18 and over can claim $100 in Dine and Discover vouchers to support businesses in hospitality, arts and recreation across the state.
There are four $25 vouchers all up. That includes two $25 Dine vouchers, which can be spent at restaurants, cafes, bars, wineries, pubs and clubs. The other two are $25 Discover vouchers, to be redeemed on cultural experiences like entertainment and recreation, live music, museums, galleries and arts venues. A full list of participating businesses can be found here.
The vouchers can be used seven days a week but they will expire on June 30, 2021.
How do I get them? Apply on the Service NSW website here. You’ll need two proof of identity cards to register. The vouchers will appear on the Service NSW app, and that’s how you can redeem with the business.
In a different scheme, in June, the NSW Government will release 200,000 vouchers worth $100 each for hotel stays in the Sydney CBD. Watch this space.

Queensland’s Holiday Dollars
The Queensland Government has launched another round of its holiday dollars campaign to boost the embattled tourism sector.
The catch is, not everyone will get them – you have to apply to win.
The latest draw to win one of 30,000 vouchers to the value of $100 to be spent in Brisbane opened on Tuesday and will run until midday Friday.
The vouchers can be spent on tourism experiences in the greater Brisbane region, including Brisbane City, Scenic Rim, Moreton Bay, Redlands Coast, Somerset, Logan and Ipswich, between May 6 and August 15, 2021.
It comes after a successful campaign to drive travellers to the Cairns region, where more than 100,000 people applied for 15,000 vouchers valued at up to $200. After Brisbane, the next round will be for the Whitsundays, from May 4.
How do I apply? Visit queensland.com to see all the rounds of Holiday Dollars and apply for the current draw.

Victoria’s Regional Travel Voucher Scheme
The bad news is allocations for the first three rounds of Victoria’s Travel Voucher Scheme have already been exhausted – and with great speed. The good news is a fourth round is coming, but we don’t know when yet.
The scheme involves $200 vouchers to be spent on accommodation, attractions and tours in regional Victoria, the Yarra and Dandenong Ranges or the Mornington Peninsula. More than 150,000 vouchers were snapped up during the first three rounds, and a separate travel voucher scheme was also launched for metropolitan Melbourne. (Allocations are already exhausted for that, too.)
Last month the Victorian Government confirmed there would be a fourth round, featuring vouchers taken up in the initial rounds but not used. More details are to be announced.
How do I apply for the fourth round? It hasn’t been updated with fourth round details yet, but information on the scheme is on the vic.gov.au website.

South Australia’s Great State Vouchers
There will be a fourth round of South Australia’s travel voucher scheme launching in late May, following the success of the previous three rounds (round three applications closed last week).
The vouchers, which are to be used to boost tourism through winter, will give $50 off participating accommodation providers in regional South Australia and suburban Adelaide, and $100 off hotels in the Adelaide CBD and North Adelaide.
More than 100,000 people registered and 50,000 people were successful in the third round of vouchers for tours and experiences, which were made available via an electronic randomised ballot. Those lucky voucher holders can see a list of participating experiences here.
How do I apply for the fourth round? Keep an eye on the southaustralia.com/voucher website — the fourth round launches in late May.
Similar voucher offers in Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the ACT have already wrapped up or applications are now closed.

India is struggling to provide oxygen vital for the treatment of seriously ill Covid-19 patients
India is struggling to provide oxygen vital for the treatment of seriously ill Covid-19 patientsSource:AFP
A devastating surge in coronavirus infections has exposed India's dilapidated health infrastructure and a deep shortage of oxygen -- a key treatment for seriously ill Covid-19 patients.
AFP looks at the reasons behind the shortage:
Oxygen therapy is crucial for severe Covid-19 patients with hypoxaemia -- when oxygen levels in the blood are too low.
"This is why it is imperative to fix oxygen supply systems in hospital settings as this is a disease that affects lungs primarily."
But the government has for years failed to invest enough money into such infrastructure, experts say.
The short answer: yes.
The bottlenecks are in transport and storage.
But India is short of cryogenic tankers.
Most oxygen producers are in India's east, while the soaring demand has been in cities including financial hub Mumbai in the west and the capital Delhi in the north.
Meanwhile, many hospitals do not have on-site oxygen plants, often because of poor infrastructure, a lack of expertise and high costs.
- What's being done? -
Industries have been ordered by the government not to use liquid oxygen.
The military has also been mobilised to transport tankers and other supplies domestically and from international sources.
- What's happening on the ground? -
Reports have emerged of hospitals asking patients to arrange for their own cylinders and of people dying even after being admitted due to low oxygen supplies.
Meanwhile, there is a growing black market for cylinders and concentrators sold far above their usual retail prices.
"The government did not plan in time," sales executive Prabhat Kumar told AFP.

Chief Nursing Officer Alison McMillan says the Health Department is monitoring vaccine hesitancy and “working very hard” to dispel some of the myths surrounding vaccines. 

Ms McMillan said it was important not to “jump to conclusions” while the deaths of two people in New South Wales who had recently received COVID-19 vaccines are under investigation.  

“The process is that NSW Health will report these to the TGA and the TGA put out an information statement yesterday and they’ll go through rigorous investigation of the clinical circumstances,” she said. 

“It’s important to remember we see about 50 patients present with some forms of clot every day, any form of clotting, it is a very common thing to find people have some form of clotting".

Ms McMillan told Sky News Australia is an "enormously successful" country when it comes to vaccine uptake, particularly when it comes to childhood vaccinations and the flu vaccine.

A new purpose-built hotel quarantine facility could be up and running in Victoria by the end of the year if the state government can convince the Commonwealth to stump up the cash for the project.

The shortlisted site under consideration is located next to the Mickleham Post Entry Quarantine Facility which holds animals upon their entry into the country.

Acting Victorian Premier James Merlino has presented a business case for an alternative quarantine hub funded and owned by the federal government but operated by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria.

The Commonwealth will look at plans for a 500-bed option costing $200 million and a 3,000-bed expanded option costing $700 million.

Quarantine Victoria Commissioner Emma Cassar said the single level cabin accommodation would be similar to Howard Springs and reduced ventilation risks present in the current system.

US President Joe Biden has declared America is “on the move again” after taking over a nation in crisis.

President Biden made his first address to a joint session of Congress where he spent 30 years as a US Senator, and delivered a message of hope.

“Throughout our history, presidents have come into this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation and to the world to declare war, to celebrate piece, to announce new plans and possibilities,” he said.

“I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding a nation, revitalising a democracy and winning the future for America”.

The president spruiked his record in his first 100 days, while praising the government’s efforts in rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine.

The president said 100 days since taking office where he inherited a nation “that was in crisis,” the United States is now “on the move again”.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has touted the Morrison government’s economic strategy during his pre-budget address saying the nation is set to avoid “what many feared would be another lost generation to long-term unemployment”.
 
Mr Frydenberg said the nation’s “sound economic position” pre-pandemic enabled it to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 “as required”. 

“Now, beyond all expectations, after the first recession in nearly 30 years, employment has not only returned to its pre-COVID level, it has surpassed it,” he said. 

“There are more Australians in work today than ever before.”

“As a direct result of our actions, Australia has experienced a smaller fall in economic activity than any major advanced economy. 

“And we are the first major advanced economy to see both hours worked and employment, return to pre-pandemic levels”. 

The treasurer said the upcoming budget will “continue to prioritise job creation and drive the unemployment rate even lower,” and “ensure Australia's fiscal position remains strong and sustainable”.

Australia is ignoring a crucial issue around its hotel quarantine system that may be putting people at unnecessary risk, one expert says.
Different surfaces have an effect on how long coronavirus can stay alive. This guide takes you through copper, cardboard, stainless steel and plastic.
Experts believe Australia should be taking airborne transmission of the coronavirus more seriously. Picture: Tony McDonough/NCA NewsWireSource:Supplied
Australia’s hotel quarantine program is under scrutiny as further COVID-19 leaks have led to more lockdowns amid claims of “negligence” in the country’s approach to airborne transmission.
Professor Michael Toole, an epidemiologist at the Burnet Institute who worked at the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) for 10 years, believes authorities are not taking the risk of airborne spread seriously enough.
He has blamed the Infection Control Expert Group (ICEG), which issues advice on infection prevention and control issues, for not producing stricter guidelines.
Concerns were again raised this week after returned travellers managed to spread COVID-19 to others in hotel quarantine in Western Australia, sparking a three-day lockdown.
It was the second time this year the state has gone into lockdown after a quarantine leak.
NSW also confirmed a leak in a Sydney hotel after two families in adjacent rooms were found to have the virus last week. It follows an earlier leak in March when a security guard and another guest became infected.
The leaks saw WA Premier Mark McGowan request the number of returning travellers entering the state be halved, a move that he may want to make permanent, and Australia has now suspended flights from India.
While some on Twitter have defended Australia’s quarantine as being hugely successful despite the small number of leaks, Prof Toole doesn’t agree.
“14 leaks in 5 cities in 5 months is not just a few,” Prof Toole wrote on Twitter in response to a post from Dr Nick Coatsworth, who is advising the Morrison government on its COVID-19 response.
“It’s negligence and ICEG is responsible.”
In explaining his post, Prof Toole told news.com.au he was concerned ICEG had not recommended the use of N95 masks instead of surgical masks, and a national standard for ventilation in hotels had not been set.
“We are still denying at a federal level that this form of transmission even occurs, we don’t even say that it occurs rarely,” he said.
“This is at the heart of the fragmented approach of protecting guests.”

The approach to hotel ventilation among states can vary widely. Victoria has analysed every hotel room in its system to ensure they have “negative pressure”, which means air flows into hotel rooms when the door is opened, rather than outwards.
South Australia has also assessed its medi-hotel where COVID-positive patients stay, although other hotels haven’t been assessed. Western Australia did a ventilation audit but did not implement changes in time to prevent the latest leak.
It’s unclear whether other states have done ventilation audits.
Prof Toole said a national standard needed to be set between state, territory and federal governments about hotel quarantine.
“Our international borders are no longer airstrips, they are the hotel corridors,” he said.
“All nine governments should be pouring resources into this issue, this is our number one defence and we are spending billions on vaccines but not spending much on making sure our borders are safe.
“Don’t penny pinch, N95 masks are not exactly made of gold. There’s no shortage of them because we hardly have any patients in hospital so we just need to do it.”
However, infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collignon, who is a member of ICEG, disagrees, and said airborne spread was not as significant as some people feared.
“If aerosol is the predominate way the virus is spread then surgical and cloth masks won’t work and it could spread really long distances, like 20 metres,” he said.
“This is not happening, the majority of the spread is happening among close contacts and masks seem to give protection.”
An ICEG statement issued in January about the emergence of more easily spread variants, acknowledged that contaminated air currents could have contributed to transmission of the virus associated with leaks in hotel quarantine.
It said airborne transmission was believed to mainly occur because of specific actions such as singing or heavy breathing during exercising, especially in poorly ventilated, crowded indoor settings.
ICEG recommended the use of face and eye protection but stopped short of specifying N95 masks.

Prof Collignon acknowledges there could be airborne spread but it is not a significant source of infection.
“Where is the evidence that if you are wearing a surgical mask and eye protection, that there has been any significant transmission to staff?,” he said.
Prof Collignon said no studies had shown N95 masks gave more protection than surgical masks in a real-world situation.
“If surgical masks are used correctly they are very effective,” he said.
“I agree good ventilation is a good idea and not having rooms with ‘positive pressure’ but most of the time when there have been infections, it’s because basic infection control hasn’t been followed.”
He said it was impossible to bring the risk of infection down to zero.
“I think NSW Health has shown you can make the risk very, very low if you follow the appropriate procedures.”
However, Prof Toole said authorities should be aiming for an 100 per cent effective strategy.
“Particularly as it’s a fragile time, an increasing number of travellers are infectious, there are new variants and we have low numbers of people vaccinated,” he said.
“We’ve had a bit of luck so far but what if the next person who is infected has a very high viral load and goes to a bar? You can get a superspreading event almost overnight.
“You can’t presume that every time there are a few cases, that that’s okay – that’s too high a risk in my opinion.”

Acting Victoria Premier James Merlino has presented a Victorian business case for an alternative quarantine hub funded by the federal government.

The shortlisted site under consideration is next to the Mickleham Post Entry Quarantine Facility which quarantines animals upon their entry into the country. 

Mr Merlino said the federal government is currently in active discussions with the Commonwealth which the Victorian government have asked to pay for the construction of the purpose-built facility.  

“The request to the Commonwealth is they pay for the construction of this facility and ultimately take ownership of this facility,” he said.

“This is a Commonwealth responsibility and just like Howard Springs, it should be owned by the Commonwealth.”

Mr Merlino noted the facility would be run by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria (CQV) and would initially contain 500 beds with the possibility of scaling the program up to take 3,000.

He said the facility could be open and functional by the end of the year if given the green light by the federal government.

Chris Lynn came under fire for an “absurd” request about Aussie cricketers in India, and now his girlfriend has weighed in on the crisis.
Cricket: Australia Cricketers' Association CEO Todd Greenberg has admitted the Australian stars remaining in India to participate in the IPL are anxious about the situation.
Chris Lynn’s idea sparked some debate.Source:Instagram
Chris Lynn’s girlfriend has responded after the cricket star came under fire for asking whether Aussies playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) could come home on a charter flight as the country’s COVID-19 crisis worsens.
India’s coronavirus death toll soared past 200,000 on Thursday as a major surge of 360,000 new infections — a global daily record — and more than 3000 deaths were recorded overnight.

The country has been brought to its knees as desperate families clamour for dwindling medical supplies, but the IPL is continuing. Cricketers taking part in the lucrative T20 tournament are playing in empty stadiums and confined to bio-secure bubbles, travelling around in full-body personal protective equipment.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced this week all flights to and from India had been suspended until May 15, including commercial and government repatriation services and Australian cricketers would not be given any preferential treatment.
Some critics panned Lynn’s “absurd” request when he floated the idea of a private charter flight being arranged to ferry Australian players back home earlier this week.
“I know there are people worse off than us. But we are going from a really tight bubble and are getting vaccinated next week so hopefully the government will let us get home on a private charter,” Lynn told The Courier Mail.
“We are not asking for shortcuts and we signed up knowing the risks. But it would be great to get home as soon as the event is over.’’
Australia's cricketers are intent on returning home safely.Source:Instagram
Lynn’s partner Karlie Andrews didn’t comment directly on Lynn’s suggestion, but said she was hoping all players could return to Australia safely when the timing was appropriate.
“I know the IPL is doing everything they can to keep our players safe in their bubble,” she told Daily Mail Australia.
“And I know all partners would obviously love to have their significant other home safe and well ASAP when the IPL is complete.
“Hopefully (Chris) is home at the end of May. It is not ideal and I miss him heaps but it won’t be forever and so just have to hang in there.”
There are still 14 Aussie cricketers in India, including David Warner, Steve Smith and Pat Cummins, along with a handful of coaches such as Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich. The group stage of the IPL is scheduled to end on May 23, with the final set for May 30.
Fast bowler Andrew Tye left the IPL because of the virus situation and is quarantining in a Sydney hotel, while Sporting News reports Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson have both managed to secure flights home after also deciding to leave the tournament early.

Lynn has no intention of jumping the queue, but wanted to explore options for returning home.Source:Instagram
Cricket Australia confirmed to news.com.au that the majority of Australian players and staff have no intention of leaving the glamorous T20 tournament early, and a chartered flight would not be necessary at this stage.
Although not directly involved in the their role at the IPL, CA and the Australian Cricketers’ Association remain in frequent contact with the players and staff.
ACA chief executive Todd Greenberg told 2GB on Wednesday morning: “One thing I can tell you … there’s no free rides or any expectations of that from our players.”
IPL chiefs reassured the tournament’s international cricketers they are “totally safe” and urged players to remain in India and keep competing.

Scientists have backed Brazil's drug regulator's decision to stop the import of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine on the basis that batches they tested carried a live version of a common cold-causing virus.
Top virologist Angela Rasmussen told AFP the finding "raises questions about the integrity of the manufacturing processes" and could be a safety issue for people with weaker immune systems, if the problem were found to be widespread.
The issue centers around an "adenovirus vector" -- a virus that normally causes mild respiratory illness but in vaccines is genetically modified so that it cannot replicate, and edited to carry the DNA instructions for human cells to develop the spike protein of the coronavirus.
The Sputnik V vaccine uses two different adenovirus vectors to accomplish this task: adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) for the first shot, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) for the second shot.
They added that this had likely occurred because of a manufacturing problem called "recombination," in which the modified adenovirus had gained back the genes it needed to replicate while it was being grown inside engineered human cells in a lab.
But on Monday they denied a request from several states in the northeast of the country to acquire more than 30 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. The federal government has additionally ordered 10 million.
Rasmussen, a research scientist at Canada's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, described the problem as a quality control issue, rather than a problem inherent to the vaccine technology.
"But in people who are immune compromised... there could be a higher rate of adverse effects because of it, including potentially serious ones."
If people aren't sure that the vaccine they are receiving is the same that was studied in trials, then "I can imagine that some people might have their reservations about getting that vaccine at all," said Rasmussen.
Denis Logunov, deputy director of the Gamaleya Institute, has responded by saying, "The statements I have read in the press have nothing to do with reality," and that the adenovirus vector was not able to replicate.
Earlier this month, Slovakia also said it had concerns over the composition of Sputnik V vaccines it had imported, saying they did not match the samples that were used in clinical studies.
He added that the response from Sputnik V's makers was not adequate.

Treasure Josh Frydenberg says the budget will introduce a series of initiatives targeting skills, infrastructure and energy in a bid to drive unemployment levels down and strengthen the economy.

Mr Frydenberg has set his sights on a jobless rate below five percent ahead of his pre-budget address in Canberra today.

In an interview with Sky News the treasurer said, “Australia has been the only advanced economy in the world that has got their employment back to where it was pre-pandemic in terms of employment levels overall”.

However, he reminded viewers the world was still in the grip of a global pandemic with India’s escalating crisis a constant reminder of the threat posed by COVID-19.

“Now is not the time for austerity. Now is not the time to prematurely pull out support from the economy,” he said.

Mr Frydenberg said analysis from treasury showed 200,000 more people in jobs would help the bottom line by approximately $5 billion each year.

A new facility to be used in a revamped quarantine system that will change the way COVID-19 cases are handled has been unveiled.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the Howard Springs quarantine facility will see an increase in beds by the end of next month so more flights can come into Australia from 'all around the world'. Mr Morrison however highlighted flights from India will not be coming to Australia for a few weeks, an announcement he made yesterday due to the rampant cases in the country. 'We'll be restarting those flights in several weeks' time we hope, and that means that the facility will be ready to take those returning Australians and we'll be continuing to move as many Australians from around the world back to Australia as safely as we possibly can,' he said. 'We have now clipped over half a million Australians, half a million, who have returned to Australia during the course of COVID. 'We've been facilitating those flights, we have been directly running charters to get Australians home and that is the number of Australians that have come back during the course of COVID.'

The Victorian government will build a dedicated COVID-19 quarantine facility at Mickleham in Melbourne’s north.
Acting Premier James Merlino made the announcement on Thursday morning just two months after Premier Daniel Andrews revealed the state would embark on the mission following several leaks of the virus from hotel quarantine.
The alternative quarantine model is expected to include cabin-style purpose-built accommodation outside of Melbourne’s CBD, similar to Howard Springs near Darwin.
The 500-bed facility will be built on Donnybrook Road and construction is expected to cost about $200m.
It will also cost $15m to get the project ready to construction.
Mr Merlino said it would take four months to build and could be open by the end of the year if the proposal was given the tick of approval in September.
Mr Merlino said the Victorian government had asked the commonwealth to fund the construction and take ultimate ownership of the site.
He said the preferred site was on commonwealth land next to an existing animal quarantine facility.

The facility is expected to address “the changing threat of new hyper-infectious, fast-moving strains of coronavirus”, Mr Andrews said in February when he revealed the government planned to go at it alone to build the facility.
Criticism of COVID-19 quarantine hotels has ramped up in recent days after the virus escaped the Mercure Hotel in Perth and sent the city into a snap three-day lockdown.

The virus also escaped from the Melbourne Airport Holiday Inn quarantine hotel in February after a returning traveller infected other guests and staff.
Victoria’s deadly second wave – that resulted in an eight-week stage 4 lockdown last year – also jumped from returned travellers to staff at a city hotel before spreading throughout the community.
Mr Merlino said about 10 sites were identified as potential locations for the facility, and one of the tasks of the business case was to narrow that down to a single preferred site.
One of the sites considered, and initially believed to be the frontrunner, was Avalon Airport.
As part of the business case, a team of senior Victorian officials investigated parcels of land close to Melbourne and Avalon airports that could be used to construct the bespoke, stand-alone accommodation hubs.
The sites were evaluated against a set of criteria that included proximity to a public hospital, international airport, transport and other services, as well as land area and site-specific considerations.

A Melbourne Airport spokeswoman confirmed to NCA NewsWire on Tuesday that they decided not to bid for the facility due to a “commercial decision”.
The government also sent a delegation to Howard Springs, which is yet to have any issues with the virus jumping from returned travellers into the community, to examine the quarantine facility as part of the business case.
Mr Merlino said the facility would be built subject to the federal government’s agreement but the state government would push on with the planning work while the commonwealth considers the proposal to not lose time.
The Victorian Government has provided a detailed summary of the business case to the commonwealth.
“This is a commonwealth responsibility and just like Howard Springs it should be owned by the commonwealth,” Mr Merlino said.
“The proposal is it would be operated by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria.
“The best time to start work on a stand-alone quarantine hub would have been 12 months ago – the second-best time is now.”
A final decision on whether to proceed with construction will be made in September, pending support from the commonwealth and future insights on a range of matters, including the progress of the nation’s vaccine rollout, the efficacy of vaccines in preventing transmission, and commonwealth decisions on rules governing travel into and out of Australia.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended hotel quarantine in its current form as high-profile political figures in Queensland and Western Australia call for a federal facility. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan have both spoken in favour of federal facilities after breaches in their own state-run quarantine programs. However, Mr Morrison hit back at such suggestions while in Darwin and pointed out hotel quarantine had a 99.99 per cent efficacy rate in containing the virus. 'The success rate of containing breaches in the hotel quarantine network is 99.99 per cent. Now I'd say that's a pretty impressive stat. Here in Howard Spring's it's 100 per cent,' he said
“The virus is going to continue to be with us for some time,” Mr Merlino said.
“We’ve got a delayed rollout of the commonwealth’s vaccine program, we have a dire situation in other parts of the world.
“We simply do not know what our situation will be in September. This is about giving us options, options to make our community even safer.”
The master plan for the new hub includes dedicated onsite services, including catering, that will support strong infection control and prevention measures.
It is also designed with the ability to be increased up to 3000 beds – at a cost of $700m – if a larger facility is determined to be required at any point.
The Victorian government plans to use the new facility, designed with relocatable cabins, for future emergency accommodation needs, including ongoing quarantine arrangements, crisis accommodation or bushfire emergency accommodation.

The site of a complex used to quarantine animals in Melbourne’s north is being considered as an alternative form of quarantine for returning travellers. 

The Andrews government has been looking for a site which could host an alternative quarantine facility similar to Howard Springs in the Northern Territory for the past three months.

It would be cabin style accommodation which would stop COVID-19 seeping out of CBD hotels into the community. 

The shortlisted site currently houses the Mickleham Post Entry Quarantine Facility which quarantines animals upon their entry into the country.

The site is 30 kilometres north Melbourne’s airport and 40 kilometres north of the CBD.

Despite Australia pausing all flights from COVID-ravaged India, an airline has confirmed there’s a flaw in the system that leaves the nation exposed.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.
A travel loophole could let people from India continue to arrive in Australia. Picture: Damian ShawSource:News Corp Australia
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has placed a pause on all flights from India, but there is still a sneaky loophole travellers from the COVID-19-ravaged nation can use to get into Australia.
The decision to pause flights came in a bid to reduce the number of infected travellers arriving in Australia, with hotel quarantine cases across the country skyrocketing in recent days.
However, it is still possible to get around the ban by transiting through Doha, the capital of Qatar, with two cricketers proving just how easy it is to get home on Thursday.
Almost 20 countries have now stopped flights from India, but Qatar and China are allowing arrivals from the nation. Flights from these countries are still arriving in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airport, with more scheduled for the future.
On Thursday, ABC News reported cricketers Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa arrived on a flight from Doha without special permissions to return.

News Corp contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and asked about the loophole but the department just referred to the comments Mr Morrison made about the travel pause on Tuesday.
In his statement, Mr Morrison said indirect flights through Doha, Dubai, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have been paused, which at least in the case of Doha, appears not to have happened.
He did not mention the possible transit through China.
“We are advised that indirect flights through Doha, Dubai, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, we are aware flights to and from these transit points and India have been paused by the respective governments,” Mr Morrison said.
but in a statement, a Qatar Airways spokesperson said the company was complying with the new rules.
“We can confirm that Qatar Airways does not currently sell tickets from India to Australia via Qatar and we are not carrying passengers on this route,” the spokesperson said.
“We remain in close contact with the relevant Australian authorities to maintain the compliance required with the current restrictions on passenger arrivals from India.”
It is understood Richardson and Zampa chose to exit the Indian Premier League tournament early on a flight arriving in Melbourne on Thursday afternoon. Cricket Australia did not seek special any special permissions for the pair as they bought commercial flights before the announcement of new travel restrictions.

Meanwhile, other countries that have placed a temporary ban on flights from India include New Zealand, Iran, France, US, UK, Hong Kong and Canada.
The decision to pause all flights from India to Australia until May 15 has left thousands of Australians stranded in the country while it battles a deadly second wave of COVID-19 infections.
When flights resume, people wishing to enter Australia will be required to have both a negative PCR test result and a negative Rapid Antigen test result prior to taking off.
Mr Morrison said priority would be given to vulnerable Australians wishing to return home.

Hotel quarantine cases still rising
It comes as multiple states and territories have experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in hotel quarantine.
NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have all experienced a rise in infected returned travellers.
On Wednesday, NSW recorded nine new hotel quarantine infections, with Ms Berejiklian warning Thursday’s figures are expected to exceed this number.
“I was just advised that overnight we have already had double digit new cases in our hotel quarantine system, which we will report on tomorrow,” she said during Wednesday’s press conference.
“The increasing incidents of disease in some parts of the world is very substantial, it is impacting us in our quarantine system.”
Authorities are still working to determine the source of origin for the new hotel quarantine cases but chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed there has been a rise in infections coming from India.
“As you would expect we are seeing a higher rate of positivity in returning travellers from India,” she said.
It follows multiple days of high quarantine infections rates, with NSW recording 49 new quarantine cases since Friday.
Queensland, which had previously been recording low levels of daily infections in returned travellers, experienced a sharp rise with nine hotel cases confirmed overnight.
South Australia has also seen an increase in hotel quarantine infections, recording 14 new cases on Monday, up from the nine recorded on Friday.
Likewise, the Northern Territory has been battling a wave of international cases, recording four new infections on Monday, 10 on Saturday and 13 on Friday.
Of those quarantine cases, 24 had arrived on flights from India.
In the past two days, Western Australia has recorded eight new hotel quarantine cases, the majority of which have been linked to returned travellers from India.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan claimed more than half of Australia’s active COVID-19 cases were now from people who had returned from India.
“These days the rate is now over half of our cases are out of India,” Mr McGowan told reporters on Wednesday, labelling the situation “terribly tragic”.

UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire for claiming some people should avoid getting vaccinated in his Spotify podcast.

Joe Rogan has been slammed for telling some people they should avoid getting vaccinated to protect against the spread of COVID-19, but Spotify hasn’t indicated it plans to take any action against the UFC commentator.
Speaking on his popular podcast, Rogan said “for the most part it’s safe to get vaccinated”, but doesn’t believe those who are young and healthy should get the jab.

The 53-year-old recommended “vulnerable” people should get the shot, adding that his parents had already been vaccinated.
“People say, ‘Do you think it’s safe to get vaccinated?’ I’ve said, ‘Yeah, I think for the most part it’s safe to get vaccinated’. I do. I do,” Rogan said on The Joe Rogan Experience in a conversation with comedian Dave Smith.
“But if you’re like 21-years-old, and you say to me, ‘Should I get vaccinated?’ I’ll go, ‘No’.
“If you’re a healthy person, and you’re exercising all the time, and you’re young, and you’re eating well, like, I don’t think you need to worry about this.
“We’re talking about something that is not statistically dangerous for children. But yet people still want you to get your child vaccinated, which is crazy to me.”
Rogan is Spotify’s No. 1 podcast host but the company’s CEO Daniel Ek declined to address his comments directly, when asked about them by Bloomberg reporter Lucas Shaw.
“What I will say is we have 8 million creators, and hundreds of millions of pieces of content,” Ek said. “We have a content policy and we do remove pieces that violate it.”

Rogan’s comments go against guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which specify that vaccinations are safe for everyone over the age of 16.
The UFC commentator inevitably copped a wave of backlash, including from America’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci.
“You’re talking about yourself in a vacuum,” he told the Today show. “If you want to only worry about yourself and not society, then that’s OK.
“But you’re saying to yourself, ‘Even if I get infected, I could do damage to somebody else even if I have no symptoms at all’, and that’s the reason why you’ve got to be careful and get vaccinated.
“You’re worried about yourself getting infected and the likelihood that you’re not going to get any symptoms. But you can get infected, and will get infected, if you put yourself at risk.”
Fauci added healthy, young people should “absolutely” get vaccinated.
The White House also rebuked Rogan for his comments. Joe Biden’s communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN: “I guess my first question would be, did Joe Rogan become a medical doctor while we weren’t looking?
“I’m not sure that taking scientific and medical advice from Joe Rogan is perhaps the most productive way for people to get their information.”
Social media wasn’t kind to Rogan either. Fellow podcaster Brandon Farmahini tweeted: “A very cringy take from Joe Rogan on vaccines. Young healthy people should get vaccinated because they can easily contract Covid, spread it & potentially serve as a vessel for the virus to mutate to be deadlier and resistant to existing vaccines. Come on Joe Rogan, be better.”
UFC reporter Ben Fowlkes posted: “If you’re a healthy 21-year-old wondering if you should get vaccinated, I beg you, ask a scientist.”
Joe Rogan's side job is broadcasting UFC fights, where one of their 26-year old professional athletes recently posted a social media post saying goodbye because he thought he was dying from covid. 'Willfully ignorant' doesn't come close to describing this. https://t.co/aFUO4E59Oo
Fun fact for Joe Rogan: If you are 21 you can still get and then transmit a virus that can kill someone who is not 21.
My feeling is that, no matter what your age, you should not take medical advice from Joe Rogan
Rogan suggested his two daughters — 12-year-old Lola and 11-year-old Rosa — showed little to no symptoms after testing positive to COVID-19.
“I mean, I hate to say that if someone’s children died from this. I’m very sorry that that happened. I’m not in any way diminishing that. But I’m saying the personal experience that my children had with COVID was nothing,” he said.
Jones has previously claimed on his podcast that the COVID pandemic was being used by elites to “reorganise society” and “end prosperity.”
According to the New York Times, 43 per cent of the US population have had at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while 29 per cent are fully vaccinated.
The Joe Rogan Experience is currently the No. 1 podcast on Spotify in the United States. It became available exclusively on the streaming service last year.
According to The Verge, a source close to the situation says Spotify reviewed this Rogan episode and allowed it to remain on the platform because he doesn’t come off as outwardly anti-vaccine.

Australia's medical regulator is investigating the deaths of two people in NSW who died just days after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

The first case involved a 55-year-old man who died in Tamworth Hospital just eight days after receiving the vaccine while the second case involved a 71-year-old man who died after receiving the AstraZeneca jab.

It has not yet been established which vaccine the 55-year-old Tamworth man had taken and no link has yet been established between the vaccine and his death.

A leading health officer has warned Aussies not to jump to conclusions following the deaths of two men after they received the COVID jab.
The head of the Therapeutic Goods Association Professor John Skerritt says current evidence does not suggest a “likely association” between the COVID-19 vaccine and two clotting events over the past days. Professor Skerritt said he cautioned the public and media against “reaching any conclusion” on the two fatalities. The TGA and the Health Department conducted an investigation into the two clotting deaths in NSW from a man in his 50s and a man in his 70s, and Professor Skerritt said the evidence suggested no likely association between the vaccine and the deaths. “Fifty Australians each day report to hospitals of the doctors with serious blood clots from a range of activities,” Professor Skerritt said. “Sometimes a blood clot can kill you within minutes, other times it may kill you weeks later if it is a very serious and potentially fatal one. “It's important to realise that we're not seeing a flood of these serious cases. “I think why it is important to emphasise that sadly, 3,000 people die every week, sadly 50 people get serious clotting disorders every day and perhaps a third of them die immediately or as soon after. “We have a shared responsibility whether we are government or civil service, the community or media, for providing accurate, unbiased information on benefits and also on risks.”

Evidence does not suggest two NSW deaths are linked to the COVID-19 vaccine, a leading health officer says.
A 55-year-old man from Tamworth and a Sydney man in his 70s both died this month after receiving the vaccine.
But the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s (TGA) John Skerritt played down links between the deaths and the jab, and issued a “strong caution” against “reaching conclusions”.
“The current evidence doesn’t suggest a likely association,” he said.
Professor Skerritt said while risks shouldn’t be “swept under the carpet”, sensationalist reporting could increase vaccine scepticism.
“We have a shared responsibility whether we’re government whether we’re civil servants, whether we’re the community, or whether we’re a media for providing accurate, unbiased information,” he said.

Professor Skerritt said about 50 Australians a day reported to hospital with serious blood clots, about a third of which proved fatal.
He said blood clotting rates from long-distance travel and the contraceptive pill were far higher, though had lower fatality rates.
“A lot of people are getting clots,” he said.
“Our job is of course to unravel whether or not there’s any association with vaccination. So far, globally there is not an overall association other than … a very rare and specific syndrome,” he said.
The TGA has not yet confirmed which vaccine the men took, but Professor Skerritt believed it was AstraZeneca.
MAN WHO DIED AFTER VACCINE IDENTIFIED
A man who died little more than a week after getting the COVID-19 vaccine has been remembered as a “much loved” and “healthy fella”.
Darren ‘Misso’ Missen, 55, died eight days after he received the jab, leaving family and friends absolutely devastated.
The “fit and healthy” man from Tamworth died in hospital last week about a week after rolling up his sleeve.
There has been no confirmed link between the vaccine and his death but health authorities are racing to determine how he died.
A friend named Mark took to Facebook to confirm Mr Missen’s death.
Information regarding the late Darren Lee Missen Please share with family and friends
“I lost a good mate during the week,” he said.
“He was a fit, healthy fella (who) loved a schooner and a punt as we do.
“Darren had the corona(virus) jab at the end of last week and was a little bit off colour at work early this week.”
Mr Missen died in hospital on April 21, eight days after getting jabbed. He will be farewelled at a funeral service on May 4 in Tamworth.

It is believed he suffered a massive blood clot in his heart or lungs. He had reportedly collapsed while running errands.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said it was aware of the case but no link between his death and the vaccine had yet been established.
It is unclear what brand of vaccine he was given.
“The reporting of an adverse event to TGA post vaccination does not mean the event was caused by the vaccination,” the TGA said in a statement.
The 71-year-old Sydney man had been given the AstraZeneca vaccine. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Dean MartinSource:News Corp Australia
“All reports to the TGA of death following vaccination are reviewed to assess the likelihood that the vaccine contributed to the event or medical condition that led to a fatal outcome.”
A review will be undertaken by experts who will look into the patient’s medical history including risk factors and medications.
The family member who spoke to the local paper said they did not blame the vaccine but were shocked.
Meanwhile, a 71-year-old Sydney man has also died after getting the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
According to 7 News, the man had several underlying health conditions and there’s no evidence his death is linked to the vaccine at this stage.
Health officials will now examine the circumstances around his death before passing on findings to the TGA.
NSW Health released a statement which said it does not discuss or speculate on individual cases.
Family said the man was “fit and healthy”. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Flavio BrancaleoneSource:News Corp Australia
“An adverse event following immunisation is any untoward medical event that occurs after a vaccination has been given, which may be related to the vaccine,” the department said.
“A conclusion regarding a causal relationship with the vaccine is not necessary to suspect or report an adverse event.”
The state’s health department said it is notified when an adverse reaction occurs which it will investigate before passing on findings.
“NSW Health investigates these events and refers its expert panel findings to the TGA, which is responsible for assessing causality,” the statement said.
“Many conditions can arise during normal life, whether or not a vaccine is administered, but it remains important to report any new serious or unexpected events so that safety can be appropriately monitored.”
No links between the deaths and the vaccines have been made at this stage. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Christian GillesSource:News Corp Australia
Paul Griffin, infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at the University of Queensland, said it was likely the men’s deaths were coincidental.
“Right now we need to respect the patients and the family’s confidentiality … most of the time these sort of events will simply be a coincidence,” he told Sunrise.
“We have vaccinated a large amount of the population and these events happen in a population all the time.”
However he said it was essential these incidents were investigated thoroughly.
“But on the whole, the vast majority will be shown to be a coincidence so we need to be really careful with jumping to conclusions,” Dr Griffin said.

Trains carrying tanker trucks filled with liquid oxygen continued to arrive in Lucknow, India, on April 28, as hospitals struggled to meet the demand for oxygen from COVID-19 patients.

India's coronavirus death toll has surpassed 200,000 but health workers and scientists warn official figures are being severely under-reported.

There are fears the true extent of the catastrophe is much worse, as the figure only represents fatalities that occur in hospitals -  which are turning away thousands of patients.  

A new global record of more than 360,000 cases was reported in the last 24-hour period.

The first shipment of vital medical supplies has arrived from the UK in Delhi, which includes 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen devices.

Sky News contributor Stephen Conroy says the Australian government has been “caught short” amid India’s COVID-19 situation. 

“[The Government] should have been putting on repatriation flights over the last 12 months,” Mr Conroy said. 

“And it should have been doing more to prepare quarantine facilities that could have been easily upgraded to take a great influx. 

“Now we’ve been caught short. We have apparently between 8,000 and 9,000 Australian citizens who are now in harm's way because we will not do what is the fundamental first obligation of a government.”

Players with Toronto FC got a real taste of the Sunshine State during a practice session in Orlando on April 26, when a giant alligator interrupted them. The team joked that they had signed the reptile, dubbed Ale Gator, tweeting: “The deal was completed using our newly acquired GAM (Gator Acquisition Money).” Gator was not included in the team’s starting line up against Mexico’s Cruz Azul on April 27, they joked.

Thousands of households across Melbourne are on COVID-19 alert after coronavirus detections in sewer catchments.
Sewage could be the key to fighting coronavirus, with scientists using wastewater monitoring to keep track of how the virus is spreading.

Thousands of households across Melbourne’s eastern, outer northern and western suburbs are being urged to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 after traces of the virus were detected in nearby sewer catchments.
Dozens of Melbourne suburbs were listed as at-risk on Wednesday night, a mere 24 hours after Victoria’s health department sent out an initial wastewater alert for 18 suburbs.
The department said it was “most likely” the detections were due to a person shedding the virus after the infectious period, given the current prolonged period of no community transmission in Victoria.
But it could also be due to a person living in or travelling through the area in the early active infectious phase, health officials warned.
People who live in or have visited Melbourne’s eastern or northern suburbs – and who have or develop COVID symptoms – are strongly encouraged to get tested. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Daniel PockettSource:News Corp Australia

With astronomical infection rates and people “dropping like flies”, this particularly confusing image out of India has attracted heavy criticism.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.

Fresh images of political rallies taking place in India have attracted strong criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has come under fire in recent weeks for his government’s handling of the devastating second wave.
A whopping 360,900 cases recorded on Wednesday — the most by a single country in a 24-hour period since the beginning of the pandemic — has scattered the nation’s healthcare system, which is now dealing with over 3,000 deaths per day with dwindling oxygen supplies and waitlists for ICU beds.
The nature of India’s tightly-packed population has spelled disaster for social distancing as the latest mutated wave wreaks havoc through the country. New statistics out of Kolkata in the region of West Bengal revealed 45 per cent of civilians turning up for tests are returning positive results.

RELATED: How India’s COVID outbreak got so bad
Despite the urgent need to stem the recent “tsunami” of infections, members of Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have continued to publicly campaign for the under-fire leader, holding political rallies to build support ahead of municipal elections.
The BJP tweeted pictures of thousands attending a rally at Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation last week. The close-up shots of rallygoers packed shoulder to shoulder — with some even forgoing masks — unsurprisingly struck a sour note with critics around the country.

Kapil Komireddi, author of the book Malevolent Republic: A Short History of the New India, condemned the ruling party, describing the political push as “murderously reckless” given the current climate.
“Only a few hundred kilometres from this event, a local journalist told me people are dropping like flies,” Komireddi said in a tweet on Tuesday.

Just to throw some light, the last campaign BJP did was in West Bengal which is seeing an upto 600% surge in COVID cases. pic.twitter.com/rfMnZnvNIl
Aam Aadmi Party politician Vinay Mishra also shared photos of the BJP election rally in the state of Telangana, writing: “Just in case if you thought your Prime Minister has become sensitive and sympathetic for COVID deaths.”
He noted that the last BJP campaign was in West Bengal, which is seeing an up to 600 per cent surge in COVID cases.
Believe it or not, this is all happening in the country that recorded record cases of over 3,60,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths in 24 hours. #indiacovidsecondwave#secondwave#covidappropriatebehaviour#BJPRally#centralvistaproject#indiacovicrisis#taleoftwoindiaspic.twitter.com/Tysk7Ku5Uy
“I’ve never seen such huge crowds,” Mr Modi said in West Bengal on April 17 — even as India set a world record of 230,000 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours.
The BJP has since deleted its post advertising the rally.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said limited vaccine coverage and a false sense of confidence after stamping out the first wave in 2020 have helped create the “perfect storm” gripping the subcontinent nation this month.
The WHO has pulled out all stops for the 1.4 billion strong population, diverting 2,600 health experts from other programs to help stem the latest wave, which has seen an incredible six million new cases emerge in April alone.

RELATED: How Aussies can help India
“As is true in any country, WHO has said the combination of relaxing of personal protective measures, mass gatherings and more contagious variants while vaccine coverage is still low can create a perfect storm,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jašarević told CNN on Wednesday.
Mr Jašarević said the healthcare system was overrun partly because of panicked patients needlessly rushing to hospitals after testing positive. The WHO representative said up to 85 per cent of positive cases could be managed safely from home in isolation.
“Currently, part of the problem is that many people rush to the hospital (also because they do not have access to information/advice), even though home-based care monitoring can be managed very safely,“ he said. “Less than 15 per cent of people who have the infection actually need hospital care and even fewer will need oxygen.”
US officials: ‘This hasn’t peaked yet’
US President Joe Biden has pledged support for India, telling Mr Modi in a phone call on Monday: “You let me know what you need, and we will do it.”
Kurt Campbell, the White House’s National Security Council coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, said the dire situation in the subcontinent will take time to settle as world powers organise international aid.
“We all have to realise that this is not a challenge that is going to resolve in the next several days,” he told a virtual press conference this week, via Reuters.
Gayle Smith, head of the US State Department’s COVID-19 response, said India needs to brace itself with the worst likely yet to come. “We all need to understand that we are still at the front end of this. This hasn’t peaked yet,” she said.
“So this is going to require determination … We’re going to work really hard for some time, but we’re confident we can do it.
“We anticipate that at the height of this kind of complex emergency, it’s going to be very fluid for a while as things fall into place. We are collectively going to have to be very agile and very nimble.”
Critics condemn PM Modi’s social media crackdown

Mr Modi’s BJP has copped consistent criticism in 2021 after reports of the Indian government censoring anti-Modi tweets began filtering through the press. The recent push to stamp out online dissidents was made possible by new social media laws forcing companies to hand over the name of the original sender of any message deemed “mischievous”.
The recent outrage over coordinating rallies and censorship has irked public figures like former Twitter India boss Raheel Khursheed, who believes the government has its priorities backwards in the middle of a crisis.
Mr Khursheed said the government shouldn’t be preoccupied with controlling public discourse as history unfolds before their eyes, calling for increased support for hospitals at capacity.
“In a pandemic the Indian government should be concerning itself with diffusing the situation rather than diffusing the news of the situation,” he told BBC Newsnight this week.
“If there are people lining up outside crematoriums waiting for their turns for over 48 to 72 hours, what you should be busy figuring out is how to diffuse that situation.
“What you should be basically figuring out is how to get oxygen to hospitals.”
Huge earthquake caps off India’s month from hell
It really feels like we’re witnessing a particularly cruel episode of Black Mirror at this point.
Just as everyone thought April couldn’t get worse for India, a massive 6.2 magnitude earthquake tore through the Assam region of the country on Wednesday. Shocking footage of the earthquake’s destruction has been shared on social media by witnesses, with a locals describing it as one of the strongest they’ve experienced.
“This earthquake was the biggest I can remember, there was first a big jolt and then a smaller one,” a police official in the town told Reuters.
India’s National Disaster Management Agency is in the process of assessing damage and casualties. There have been no immediate reports of deaths.
“Our entire multi-storeyed apartment has witnessed massive damage with roofs and walls caving in,” Subham Hazarika, a businessman who lives in an up-market apartment in Guwahati, told Reuters.
“Luckily no one got injured.”

The pandemic transformed shopping, creating some positive habits that can help us manage our money – and lives – for years to come.
Rent and mortgages have been the number one money worry for Australians for years – but a difficult 2020 has changed that.

The coronavirus pandemic transformed shopping, creating positive habits among consumers that should help them better manage their money – and their lives – for years to come.
New spending trends highlight some new-found appreciation and beliefs “that we should try to keep up”, says Jethro Marks, CEO of e-commerce platform The Nile Group.
Marks says during the pandemic demand for parenting advice books more than trebled, and baby products are also surging.
“Old school board games and puzzles have also made a really strong comeback and remain high, as a refreshing way to spend some good quality time with family, minus the screen time,” he says.

How many colds have you had in the past year?
For many Australians the answer is zero or close to zero, after they spent much more money on hand sanitisers and other home hygiene products.
“This new focus on illness prevention – instead of just being resigned to regularly coughing and sneezing – is one we should all continue moving forward,” Marks says.
Queensland Consumers Association spokesman Ian Jarratt says many Australians experienced reduced incomes or job losses, or know friends and family who suffered financially.
“Quite a few people have become more conscious about how much they spend and the benefits of getting value for money,” he says.
There is also a rapid reduction in credit card debt and greater focus on budgeting, which are both “very positive”, Jarratt says.

As online spending surged, the days of buying goods in a shop without checking competitors’ prices almost disappeared.
“I think online has encouraged people to shop around,” Jarratt says.
However, the rapid shift to online shopping has removed some opportunities to haggle in-store for extras such as free delivery, extended warranties or better products, he says.
Marks says DIY kits, books and instruction manuals have surged in popularity in areas including gardening, carpentry, needlework, flower arranging and even witchcraft.
“Cookbooks overall shot up by 616 per cent when we were all stuck at home, and continue to dominate now,” he says.
Making time to continue embracing hobbies and passions will help create more fulfilling and creative lives, Marks says.

A man has been charged by police and banned from a local shopping centre after allegedly covering a legitimate COVID-19 QR code with a fake one.
Using QR codes to check into venues is likely to become a permanent feature in NSW, even after the vaccine is rolled out.

A South Australian man has been charged after allegedly placing a fake QR code over a store’s legitimate COVID-19 digital check in.
Colin Mark Davies, 51, was arrested and charged with two counts of obstructing operations carried out relative to COVID-19 under the Emergency Management Act.
Police attended his Edwardstown home on Wednesday over the allegations that took place at Franco's Fruit and Veg in South Plympton on Sunday.
After officers searched his home, they allegedly found a double-side knife, which is classified as a prohibited weapon, and was further charged with possessing a prohibited weapon.
Mr Davies was refused police bail and appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court via video link later that afternoon.
Mr Davies’ defence lawyer argued her client should not be held in custody as the maximum penalty for the crime was a fine and it would be “disproportionate” to his offence.
She also said that because the knife was found in her client’s bedroom that a defence on the weapons charge was “likely”.
“He has no prior history of breaching bail … we say bail can be put in place to ensure the safety of the community,” the defence lawyer said.
“He didn’t realise that he was going to find himself in a position where he was going to be in custody.
“I reiterated to him that he can’t engage in this behaviour again and he has indicated to me he is not going to do so.
“Noting the maximum penalty, he should be given the benefit of the doubt so that he can prove to the community he can comply.”
Mr Davies’ lawyer said the store manager immediately noticed that the fake QR code was placed on top of the real one.
Magistrate Michelle Sutcliffe said Mr Davies offending had the potential to have “very serious consequences” but granted him bail.
Under his bail conditions, Mr Davies cannot attend the Forbes Shopping Centre in Adelaide’s southwest or possess any loose QR code labels.
In a statement, South Australia Police reassured the public that no personal data was released through the incident.
“Any person found to be tampering or obstructing with business QR codes will likely face arrest and court penalty of up to $10,000,” they said.
Businesses or customers who suspect false QR codes being attached to a COVID Safe Plan should contact the police assistance line on 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

A new report has revealed that a new pill is being developed by Pfizer as a potential cure for COVID-19.

A pill that’s being developed by Pfizer as a potential cure for COVID-19 could be ready later this year if the trials are successful, a report said.
The antiviral drug, PF-07321332, is designed to attack the “spine” of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prevent it from replicating in the nose, throat and lungs, the Telegraph reported.
“We have designed PF-07321332 as a potential oral therapy that could be prescribed at the first sign of infection, without requiring that patients are hospitalised or in critical care,” Mikael Dolsten, who leads the company’s worldwide research, development and medical division, said in a statement.
Trials are already underway with volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60 in the US and Brussels, the newspaper reported.

“If they have moved to this stage, they will be quietly optimistic,” Dr Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, told the Telegraph.
The drug company said the first phase of the trial is designed to look at how the drug is tolerated, in addition “significant side effects, and how people feel after taking it,” according to documents obtained by the newspaper.
The second phase will study how participants react to multiple doses, while the third will look at the impact of eating while on the drug, the outlet reported.

More trials would be needed to determine how the drug works with people infected with COVID-19, the newspaper reported.
If the results of the trials are promising, the oral medication could be available later this year, the outlet reported.
Pfizer, along with its partner BioNTech, has already developed a COVID-19 vaccine that has been shown to be more than 95 per cent effective.

Pakistan is still recording an average of 5000 COVID-19 cases a day but a quartet of Australians have signed up for the Pakistan Super League.
Cricket: Prime Minister Scott Morrison has held a press conference to announce that all flights from India are now paused and that IPL players will not receive special rules.

Usman Khawaja is set to defy concerns over the COVID-19 crisis on the subcontinent and play in Pakistan, the country of his birth, after being picked up in the Pakistan Super League‘s “replacement draft”.
The PSL was suspended in March amid several breaches of the tournament’s biosecurity arrangements and with numerous players, including veteran Australian spinner Fawad Ahmed, contracting COVID-19.
Only 14 matches were played, with the 20 games all to be played in the National Stadium in Karachi in June.
Khawaja was selected by the Islamabad United franchise, along with fellow Australians James Faulkner, Callum Ferguson and Joe Burns, who were all picked by the Lahore Qalandars.
The remainder of the tournament will be played across 18 days in a biosecurity bubble being put in place by a UK-based company. Teams will assemble by May 23 and do a mandatory seven-day quarantine.
There have been more than 17,000 COVID deaths in Pakistan and concerns are also growing concerns the country could be on the same path as India after more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases were recorded on April 25.
Ahmed, who was laid up in bed for 17 days after contracting the virus during the early stages of the PSL, is listed as set to return to Islamabad United and play with Khawaja, who has never played in Pakistan.
ALHAMDULILLAH got my 2nd test NEGATIVE result,THANKS FOR ALL UR KIND PRAYERS & SUPPORT 🙌🏽♥️,Please don’t take Covid as a joke, u might be young n healthy but look after those ones who r aged n with medical conditions, stay blessed 🙌🏽 @IsbUnited 👍🏽 @thePSLt20#PSL6#COVID19 #✈️😍
The Australian Test team hasn’t played in Pakistan since 1998 and Khawaja, who was born in Islamabad then shifted to Australia at age five, feared he’d never get to play there.
“I‘d love to go over there and play,” he told cricket.com.au earlier this month.
“To go home to where it all began for myself, my family.
“I love cricket returning to that region, too. Because I think they‘re doing some really, really good stuff over there; doing some really hard work to get people to come over.
“I‘d love to see an Australian team tour to Pakistan in the not too distant future ... but I guess it needs a bit of buy-in from the players too.”
Australia is scheduled for an away series against Pakistan in February and March of 2022, with two Tests, three ODIs and three T20s, but that tour, like so many in the current environment, is not locked in.

India’s coronavirus death toll has officially surpassed 200,000, but experts and health workers warn the true scale of devastation is much worse.

More than 360,000 new cases were reported in the past 24-hours; the seventh consecutive day where global records were beaten.

Health workers and scientists have warned the official death figures are being under-reported as dears the true extent of India’s COVID-19 catastrophe is much worse.

Official figures have only been taking into account fatalities which occur in hospitals, but many hospitals and medical facilities have been forced to turn away thousands of patients due to over capacity.

India’s debilitating second wave has broken a grim new record after shocking numbers from the troubled nation were released on Wednesday.
With surging new cases and deaths, India is facing an unfolding coronavirus catastrophe. Here's what led the country to this state of emergency.

India has recorded its worst day on record as it reels from its latest debilitating coronavirus crisis, recording a whopping 360,960 new infections and 3293 deaths in last 24-hour period.
The new figures mark an incredible jump after the nation recorded 220,000 fresh cases on Tuesday.
India has now reported a total of 18 million infections, with the latest daily spike the highest a single country has ever recorded in a 24-hour period.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world was doing everything it can to help the struggling country, which has spent the last week breaking global infection records.
“WHO is doing everything we can, providing critical equipment and supplies, including thousands of oxygen concentrators, prefabricated mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies,” he said.

This month alone, the country has added almost six million new cases.
The explosion in infections, blamed in part on a new virus variant as well as mass political and religious events, has overwhelmed hospitals and caused a dire shortage of beds, drugs and oxygen.
The crisis is particularly severe in New Delhi, with people dying outside packed hospitals where three people are often forced to share beds. Clinics have been running out of oxygen.India has so far administered 150 million vaccine shots and from Saturday, the program will be expanded to include all adults, meaning 600 million more people will be eligible.
However, many states are warning that they have insufficient vaccine stocks and experts are calling on the government to prioritise vulnerable groups and badly-hit areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come under fire for his response to the “tsunami” after reports of the Indian government censoring anti-Modi tweets filtered through the press.

Former Twitter boss in India Raheel Khursheed said the government shouldn’t be preoccupied with controlling public discourse as history unfolds before their eyes, calling for increased support for hospitals at capacity.
“In a pandemic the Indian government should be concerning itself with diffusing the situation rather than diffusing the news of the situation,” he told BBC Newsnight this week.
“If there are people lining up outside crematoriums waiting for their turns for over 48 to 72 hours, what you should be busy figuring out is how to diffuse that situation.
“What you should be basically figuring out is how to get oxygen to hospitals.”
Just as everyone thought it couldn’t get worse for the world’s second most populous nation, a massive 6.2 magnitude earthquake tore through the Assam region of the country on Wednesday. Shocking footage of the earthquake’s destruction has been shared on social media by witnesses, with a locals describing it as one of the strongest they’ve experienced.
“This earthquake was the biggest I can remember, there was first a big jolt and then a smaller one,” a police official in the town told Reuters.
However, no deaths have been recorded so far.
Australia has begun to see the effects of the ongoing crisis in India as people attempt to leave the country in droves. WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state was preparing for more cases after a flight touched down in Perth on Tuesday carrying 78 passengers who had recently been in India.
Mr McGowan said two of the four new WA cases in hotel quarantine likely brought the virus from the subcontinent.

“So many people are dying, it’s awful,” he told reporters on Wednesday.
“But we’ve seen over the course of the last week it puts a lot of pressure on our system, so we’re doing all we can to make sure that Australia and Western Australia remain in a good condition.
“It means we have to make tough decisions.”
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would be suspending all direct flights to India until May 15, leaving over 9000 Aussies - including a number of cricketers playing in the IPL - stranded.
Massive oxygen shortages have NGOs working around the clock in the country’s most densely populated urban sprawls to help the worst affected with the virus.
Australia’s federal government is currently in talks about sending excess respirators to India’s overrun healthcare system.

A diplomat returning from overseas drove from Sydney to Canberra to quarantine at home before testing positive to coronavirus.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone – including vaccinated populations.

A diplomat returning from overseas tested positive for COVID-19 after entering Canberra, officials said on Wednesday.
The man in his 50s flew to Sydney International Airport and travelled to the nation’s capital via private vehicle on the same day, Australian Capital Territory health authorities said in a statement.
“While in quarantine, the diplomat experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms and was tested for COVID-19, returning a positive result,” the statement read.
It said the man did not stop on his way to Canberra and has been quarantined at home since he returned.
“The individual has followed all quarantine measures for returning overseas travellers and is being supported by ACT Health,” the statement said.
Health officials will perform genome sequencing to see what strain of the coronavirus the man was infected with.

Three close contacts have been identified via contact tracing and have also been put in quarantine.
“There is no risk to the public,” the health department said.
The department said that returning diplomats and government officials enter the capital “on a regular basis” and that reports of positive cases in the territory’s quarantine system are not uncommon.
“This is exactly why the ACT has a quarantine system,” the statement said.
“The circumstances of this new case demonstrates that our quarantine system here in the ACT is working well to protect the Canberra community from COVID-19.”
The ACT has had the lowest COVID-19 numbers in the country since the pandemic started last year.
There have only been 123 total cases in Canberra, including overseas infections.

NSW residents have been told to prepare for another spike in hotel quarantine infections, as the alarming trend continues across multiple states.

The alarming rise in hotel quarantine infections across multiple Australian states is expected to worsen, with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian warning of a “double digit” spike.
NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have all experienced a surge in returned travellers testing positive to COVID-19 in recent days, with many cases linked to people coming back from coronavirus ravaged India.
So far today there have been 24 COVID-19 cases in hotel quarantine across Australia. However, not all states have released their daily figures so that number could grow.
On Wednesday, NSW recorded nine new hotel quarantine infections, with Ms Berejiklian warning tomorrow’s figures are expected to exceed this number.
“I was just advised that overnight we have already had double digit new cases in our hotel quarantine system, which we will report on tomorrow,” she said during Wednesday’s press conference.
“The increasing incidents of disease in some parts of the world is very substantial, it is impacting us in our quarantine system.”

Authorities are still working to determine the source of origin for the new hotel quarantine cases but chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed there has been a rise in infections coming from India.
“As you would expect we are seeing a higher rate of positivity in returning travellers from India,” she said.
It follows multiple days of high quarantine infections rates, with NSW recording 49 new quarantine cases since Friday.
Queensland, which had previously been recording low levels of daily infections in returned travellers, experienced a sharp rise with nine hotel cases confirmed overnight.
South Australia has also seen an increase in hotel quarantine infections, recording 14 new cases on Monday, up from the nine recorded on Friday.

Likewise, the Northern Territory has been battling a wave of international cases, recording four new infections on Monday, 10 on Saturday and 13 on Friday.
Of those quarantine cases, 24 had arrived on flights from India.
In the past two days, Western Australia has recorded eight new hotel quarantine cases, the majority of which have been linked to returned travellers from India.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan claimed more than half of Australia’s active COVID-19 cases were now from people who had returned from India.
“These days the rate is now over half of our cases are out of India,” Mr McGowan told reporters on Wednesday, labelling the situation “terribly tragic”.
Questions over who is allowed to leave and re-enter Australia
It follows revelations that Perth’s recent three-day lockdown was sparked by a man who was allowed to travel to India for his wedding before returning to Australia.
In response to the growing COVID-19 crisis in India, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has suspended flights to and from the country until May 15.
Epidemiologist Professor at the University of Sydney, Alexandra Martiniuk, told news.com.au that cases of people being allowed to leave the country for seemingly non-essential reasons have sparked a discussion about what should and shouldn’t be allowed.
“Australian citizens have voiced that the decision-making regarding who is allowed to travel overseas and then return, is opaque and this could be made more clear,” she said.
“For instance there is concern about this travel is for weddings, athletes, movie stars, etc. Then these ‘travellers’ return (with) an increasing number carrying COVID.”

Professor Martiniuk said it appears the public is in agreeance that travel for compassionate reasons should be allowed, such as to assist a family member dying overseas or to attend a funeral, but there is concern about how broad the reasons for leaving the country have become.
With multiple states seeing transmission events in hotel quarantine settings in recent weeks, this spike of infected travellers also serves to heighten fears the virus could leak back into the community.
Is our current hotel quarantine system the best option?
Professor Martiniuk said the government needs to consider if its current hotel quarantine system is the best option for Australians.
“The variants (overseas) are more transmissible, and we need to consider if the hotels are best equipped to deal with airborne spread,” she said.
“We do need to consider if quarantine in hotel facilities in major cities is the best approach. Having this approach justified for the public would be useful.”
Many health professionals have been urging the government to further consider the seriousness that airborne transmission can pose, particularly in hotel quarantine settings.
UNSW’s head of biosecurity research, Professor Raina MacIntyre, told news.com.au that more needs to be done to stop ongoing leakages from hotels, adding there is more at stake now more mutant strains of the virus are emerging.
“The next issue is addressing airborne transmission – sadly, this is denied by the national committee, ICEG, which advises AHPPC,” she said.
“As long as we deny airborne transmission, we cannot stop continual breaches in hotel quarantine. We need to address ventilation, use portable air cleaners, provide hotel quarantine staff with N95 respirators, and select quarantine venues based on the adequacy of ventilation.”
The increase in hotel quarantine cases across Australia reflects the “global situation” with respect to COVID-19, Professor Martiniuk said, pointing out it is a grim reminder of why our international borders have remained closed for so long
“Sadly it has reminded us in Australia that the reopening of borders may not come as soon as hoped,” she said.
“Watching the world grapple with COVID however, has given further support to the approaches being taken by Australia which have protected our residents’ health and our economy.”

An out-of-print card game released more than 25 years ago appears to have eerily foreshadowed COVID-19 and Donald Trump’s election.
These theories became proven fact, from a government brainwashing program, an anti-John Lennon plot to a plan to remove homosexuals from service.

An out-of-print conspiracy theory collectable card game released more than 25 years ago appears to have eerily foreshadowed current events including the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest in Washington DC and the rise of political correctness.
Sealed decks of Illuminati: New World Order (INWO) cards currently fetch up to $1300 on sites like Amazon and eBay.
Some sought-after individual cards – such as “Terrorist Nuke”, which depicts a scene uncannily similar to the 9/11 attacks – go for more than $50 apiece.
A long-time favourite of collectors, INWO, released in 1994 by Steve Jackson Games, is a Magic: The Gathering-style spin-off of the company’s Illuminati board game, which itself was based on the 1975 Illuminatis! Trilogy novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
Internet users and conspiracy theorists have drawn attention to the cards over the years for the apparent prescience of the irreverent, apocalyptic artwork – notably after September 11, 2001, due to an image resembling the explosion as the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and another depicting flames coming out of the Pentagon.

One of the artists conceded that it ‘does seem oddly prescient’.Source:Supplied
Other cards – there are 330 in total – have been highlighted on social media more recently for their apparent relevance to current events.
They include Donald Trump’s presidency – a blond-haired “Charismatic Leader” depicted speaking to a large crowd – the COVID-19 pandemic, violent riots and protests in the US, and images of a militarised White House surrounded by wire fencing.

The US has been rocked by waves of riots since early last year.Source:Supplied
Other cards show harsh police crackdowns.Source:Supplied
One card, “Epidemic”, depicts a pile of body-bags, a face mask, gloves, disinfectant and the word “quarantine”.
“Disaster! This is an Attack to Destroy any Place,” the text reads. “If the attack succeeds, the target is Devastated. This attack cannot actually destroy the target.”
Another card, “Center for Disease Control”, reads, “As its action, the CDC can supply Relief to one Devastated location each turn. If the CDC makes a direct attack to destroy a Place, it can use biological warfare to get a +15 (!!) to its attack.”

Many governments are enacting sweeping reforms.Source:Supplied
The cards accurately depict the US Congress.Source:Supplied
A card dubbed “Political Correctness” depicts two men hanging by nooses with signs reading “used insensitive pronoun” and “ate flesh of dead animals”. “Good thoughts are now required,” the card says. “Increase the Power of all Liberal groups by 3. All Conservative groups with a Power of 0 or 1 become Criminal as well.”
Several cards relate to unrest in the streets, including “Upheaval!”, which depicts a protester punching riot police, and “Law and Order”, which features a cop swinging a baton at a cowering person.
Other cards include “Market Manipulation”, “Sweeping Reforms”, “Rewriting History”, “Gun Control”, “March on Washington”, “Combined Disasters”, “Media Blitz”, “Urban Gangs” and “World War Three”.
One supernatural-themed card appropriately features a “Plague of Demons” swarming around the US Congress building, while the “Watermelons” card reads, “One-time Communists, looking for a new cause, drift into Green movements. All Green groups are considered Communist and vice versa.”

Game designer Steve Jackson, writing in Dragon Magazine, has previously described the origins of the Illuminati games and that he wanted the tone to be “tongue-in-cheek rather than serious”.
“It’s possible to get deadly serious about the idea of conspiracies and assassinations,” he said. “I didn’t want that. Among all the material I’d read, the articles with the really wacky theories – even if they were presented totally seriously – were the most fun to read. Logically, then, a wacky game should be more fun to play.”
He added that “as much as possible, I wanted to retain the ‘flavour’ of the conspiracy material I’d been reading”.
“That’s why groups like the South American Nazis, the Cattle Mutilators, the Fluoridators, the Communists, the Oil Companies, and the United Nations, are in there,” he said.
“You can’t have a good conspiracy theory without stringing together all these elements and a dozen more – so here they are.”
This appears to be true today.Source:Supplied
Game designer Steve Jackson was ‘immensely entertained’ by conspiracies.Source:Supplied
John Grigni, one of the illustrators who worked on the cards, spoke to Vice News in 2012 about some of the seemingly prophetic imagery.
“The Twin Towers card is actually titled ‘Terrorist Nuke’, which I recall from that time was a concern relating to the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he said.
“Terrorism was heating up as a ‘headline seller’ without the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation, but we were still looking at Hamas and Palestine as likely culprits for such acts. Art direction-wise, frankly a nuke wouldn’t just blow up one building, even a ‘tactical’ nuke would do damage on a much larger scale. It does seem oddly prescient, given the ‘twin towers’ shown.”
Loyd Blankenship, a hacker who worked for Steve Jackson Games and was responsible for the company’s offices being raided by the Secret Service in 1990, told the publication Mr Jackson was a “huge fan of conspiracy theories”.
“Not that he believes in them – as far as I could tell in five years of working with him – rather, he is immensely entertained by them,” he said.
“As for the ‘predictions’ from the cards, it’s pretty much like any psychic – say that a Middle Eastern leader will be killed next year and you have a decent chance of getting it right.”

India’s growing COVID-19 emergency has raised concerns of vaccine apartheid where the world’s poorest nations have access to just over one per cent of the world’s vaccines.

The South Asian country has been recording more than half of the world’s daily coronavirus cases as well as over 2,000 daily deaths from the deadly disease.

The dire situation in India has raised questions about the global vaccine rollout as the world’s poorest nations have a combined total of 1.3 per cent of the vaccines, while the wealthiest nations have gained access to more than 50 per cent.

Prominent Australian executive Tim Costello told Sky News the global vaccination program - COVAX - has not worked.

"It was meant to produce two billion doses for the poor developing world; it's only produced 43 million doses because it hasn't been properly funded," he said.

Mr Costello said many of the doses bound for COVAX were being made in India which is now incapable of asssiting with supply.

"Now with the apocalyptic shocking oubtreak in India, of course that's not going to happen either," he said,

Investigations have wrapped up into a COVID-19 spread at two separate Sydney hotels – but one big mystery remains.
A new variant has emerged from the subcontinent, but is it driving the deadly second wave of COVID in India itself?
Key questions remain unanswered after NSW Health wrapped up investigations into two unrelated coronavirus transmission events at Sydney quarantine hotels. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Flavio BrancaleoneSource:News Corp Australia
Key questions remain unanswered after NSW Health wrapped up investigations into two unrelated coronavirus transmission events at Sydney quarantine hotels.
The spread of the virus within the Mercure and Adina hotels earlier this month highlighted the increased risk of transmission as new strains of coronavirus hit Australian shores.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said while it remained unclear exactly how the virus managed to spread between guests in adjacent rooms in the Adina hotel in early April, officials have developed theories for how it could have happened.
“The transmission could have occurred through aerosols down-drifting between the two rooms or via a shared partitioned balcony,” Dr Chant said.
Aerosols is another word for airborne particles.

At the Mercure Hotel, there was no obvious method of transmission found.
“There wasn’t – based on engineering and other assessment – an aerosol transmission route,” Dr Chant said.
“But obviously, we know with COVID transmission that it can sometimes be very subtle in the way it’s occurred.”
At the Adina Apartments Hotel near Town Hall, seven people from two different family groups who arrived from different countries and on different days were found to have been infected with the virus.
They stayed in adjacent rooms in the hotel. Three of the cases were reclassified from acquired overseas to locally infected as the investigation progressed.
At the Mercure Hotel in Sydney’s CBD, a returned traveller who stayed in a room next to where two members of the same family were housed was reclassified as a local case on Tuesday this week.

“An investigation into how COVID-19 transmission occurred between returned travellers who had been in quarantine at the Mercure Hotel has led NSW Health to reclassify one case, previously reported as overseas acquired, as locally acquired,” NSW Health wrote in a statement on Tuesday morning.
All three Mercure Hotel cases had the highly transmissible South African strain of coronavirus.
There has been an increasing prevalence of mutant strains of coronavirus, labelled “variants of concern” by NSW authorities.
In the latest weekly COVID-19 report, the health department wrote that 41 per cent of overseas-acquired cases were diagnosed with one of three variants of concern that originated in the UK, South Africa and Brazil respectively.
Between November 29 last year and last Thursday when the report was issued, 584 returned travellers had been diagnosed with coronavirus.
Of those, 123 people, or 23 per cent, had a variant of concern.
There were no new local cases on Wednesday but nine new cases in overseas travellers.

There are situations where people can go overseas to attend a wedding and come home despite tens of thousands unable to return to Australia.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone – including vaccinated populations.

The government has been accused of leaving stranded Aussies “in the lurch (and) confused” after revelations people can still travel overseas for weddings and take a quarantine place on return.
The government has barred Australian travel to India for weddings and funerals, as the country grapples with the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak.
But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke confirmed on Wednesday that measure would not be extended to other countries.
Labor home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally said the government had left the 34,500 Australians wanting to return home “in the lurch, confused and left behind”.
“Seriously, this tired old Liberal government doesn’t know if it’s coming or going. What a mess,” she said.

“Let’s remember, if Scott Morrison kept his promises – like bringing all of the stranded Aussies home by Christmas last year or rolling out a vaccine this year – we wouldn’t be in this mess right now.”
Earlier, Mr Hawke told Sky News that Australians could still be granted exemptions for “urgent reasons”, which could include attending a wedding.
“So next week someone could still go overseas, go to a wedding and come back through quarantine?” asked host Tom Connell.
“Yes. There can be situations, but maybe not to India at this moment,” Mr Hawke replied.
Exemptions allowing overseas travel for weddings are contentious, particularly after it was revealed the source of a COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia had been allowed to travel to India for a ceremony.
The Australian Border Force’s operational directive for outbound exemptions does not mention weddings but exemptions were “generally” approved for a family member’s funeral overseas.

WA Premier Mark McGowan last week said it was “just nuts” to allow guests to potentially bring the virus home.
Every returning traveller also takes up a limited space in hotel quarantine, adding to the 34,500 Australians registered with DFAT wanting to return home.
“Why (can) that person go off to a wedding when someone else is wanting to get home, because they need to get home, because they can’t earn money anymore?” Connell asked.
Mr Hawke rejected suggestions it was a “zero sum game” despite a cap on hotel quarantine places.
“It’s never about exactly one place versus another. It’s flight availability. Affordability has changed several times during the pandemic,” he said.
Mr Hawke said the government had ramped up charter flights, but many Australians overseas had “changed their minds” about returning home.

A DFAT spokesperson confirmed 512,000 Australians have returned home since the government recommended people reconsider their need to travel abroad.
The government on Tuesday suspended all flights from India until mid-May at the earliest after the country recorded over 350,000 COVID-19 cases on Sunday.
The moved left roughly 9000 Australians stranded in India, including between 600 and 650 listed as vulnerable.
A group of Australian cricketers, including superstar Steve Smith, are also stuck having travelled to compete in the lucrative Indian Premier League.
But Mr Hawke said the government would not expedite their return.
“That’s a difficult situation, everyone’s in difficult situation,” he said.
“(But) the government’s put a priority on vulnerable Australians … I think Australians would expect us to have that priority.”

There are concerns coronavirus could be spread through one of the most routine things humans do, with calls for more research.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone - including vaccinated populations.
Could COVID spread through toilet flushing? Picture: NCA NewsWire/Bianca De MarchiSource:News Corp Australia
There are concerns toilets could spread COVID-19 because flushing could generate aerosols that linger in the air.
A report published in the Medical Journal of Australia highlighted several examples of how coronavirus was spreading via airborne transmission including by “faecal aerosols produced by toilet flushing”.
The article refers to an outbreak in an apartment building in China where the virus appeared to spread between a person on the 15th floor to “vertically aligned flats” on the 25th and 27th floors “by means of dried-out floor or bath drains”.
“An environmental sample in an unoccupied flat on the 16th floor was also positive. Faecal aerosols produced by toilet flushing were thought to be responsible,” the report said.
Speaking to NCA NewsWire Deakin University Chair of Epidemiology, professor Catherine Bennett, said there was no evidence COVID-19 had spread via toilets in hotel quarantine but anything that increased the risk of aerosolization should be examined.

“There’s going to be contaminated discharge (after flushing) but that depends on how the toilets work – that’s an engineering question,” she said.
“Anyway that you can actually increase your risk of aerosolization (increases risk of transmission).
“Do we need to worry about the bathroom systems in hotels? It’s something they should look at.”
She highlighted how the majority of instances where the virus had spread between returned travellers in hotel quarantine had occurred between adjacent rooms.
Professor Bennett said rooms above and below had bathrooms which could feed into the same sewage pipe, meaning there would be more examples of transmission between rooms on various floors, which wasn’t the case.
“We’re not seeing vertical transmission, we’re only seeing transmission occur on the same floor,” she said.
“While we have to be aware of every possible flaw, particularly in hotel quarantine, we’re not seeing anything to suggest the plumbing side of it is an issue, but we’ve definitely seen enough to prove local aerosolized spread is the most important thing to focus on from here.”

The report called for more research into how toilets could spread infectious diseases.
“Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities,” the report stated.
University of South Australia epidemiologist Professor Adrian Esterman said transmission via aerosols was one of the reasons he always closed the lid before flushing.
“Another way of generating aerosols is the use of hand blow dryers,” he said.
Though studies have found traces of COVID-19 in the gastrointestinal tract, and sewage surveillance programs have detected traces in wastewater, there’s no evidence of infection taking place through faeces, the World Health Organisation said last year.
The Department of Health said there wasn’t a big risk of COVID-19 spreading through toilet use in Australia because the country’s plumbing is different than in some other countries.
A spokesperson said that there were early fears that COVID-19 would spread in the same way as SARS did in 2003, when high-rise apartment toilets were found to generate aerosols that contributed to transmission.
“To date there has not been convincing evidence that COVID-19 mimics SARS completely, and for SARS this potential transmission pathway was not seen extensively in other regions indicating other factors including building codes are important to consider,” the spokesperson said.
“It is generally important that anyone who has been to the bathroom maintains good hand hygiene and washes their hands. People should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
“The department monitors emerging evidence on transmission pathways, and notes that differences in plumbing and building codes exist between countries which may reduce the relevance of this issue in the Australian context.”

When the coronavirus pandemic reached South America human activity on the Galapagos Islands, in the Pacific west of Ecuador, ground almost to a halt, leaving giant tortoises, iguanas and other endemic species to themselves.
A four-month lockdown starting in February 2020 after Covid-19 was first detected in the region resulted in a total halt of tourism and near complete shutdown of scientific research.
"We had no time to prepare ourselves."
Moncayo's business hasn't recovered. Sometimes his boat sets out to sea with just two customers -- each paying a minimum $160 -- when he needs five to make a profit.
"Out of 12, there are just six left in business," said Moncayo.
Many businesses have kept their shutters down. Hotels and restaurants are deserted.
Some 85 percent of the local economy is dependent on tourism.
One lesson she's learnt is the need for tourism that is "based more on durability ... as a natural heritage site for humanity, that's a responsibility we have to the whole world."
Scientists, too, found themselves twiddling their thumbs, particularly during the lockdown.
Only 30,000 people live on these volcanic islands located around 1,000-kilometers west of Ecuador.
"For a biologist, the Galapagos Islands are Disneyland," added Salinas.
British naturalist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution following a long trip that took in the archipelago of 21 volcanoes, including 13 active ones, the tallest of which is the Wolf at 1,707-meters.
There was "a direct impact on the scientific program: 60 percent of research activities planned for 2020 were suspended," said Danny Rueda, the director of the Galapagos National Park (PNG), responsible for 97 percent of the Galapagos land area and a vast marine reserve of almost 800,000 hectares.
But "movement from one island to another was not allowed."
- 'Time to breathe' -
The government plans to vaccinate all adults on the islands by the end of May, making it "the first archipelago in Latin America" free of Covid-19.
"It's given us a chance to breathe, to organize and analyze the data we've compiled," said Paola Lahuatte, 30, another biologist from the Charles Darwin Foundation, who is studying an invasive species of fly threatening 18 bird species.

A worrying spike in hotel quarantine cases across multiple states has sparked fears, now another state has been caught up in the “diabolical” virus threat.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone – including vaccinated populations.

An unsettling trend has emerged across Australia, raising fears the “diabolical” COVID-19 crisis in India could be putting Aussies at risk.
Multiple Aussie states have experienced a sharp spike in hotel quarantine cases over the past few days, with many of the new infections linked to travellers returning from India.
On Wednesday Queensland, which had previously been recording low hotel quarantine infection rates, recorded a sharp rise with nine infected returned travellers confirmed overnight.
In NSW nine new overseas cases were announced in the past 24 hours, a dip from the 12 received on Tuesday.
It followed eight infections the previous day and a massive 18 cases in hotel quarantine on Friday.
South Australia has also seen an increase in hotel quarantine infections, recording 14 new cases on Monday, up from the nine recorded on Friday.
Likewise, the Northern Territory has been battling a wave of international cases, recording four new infections on Monday, 10 on Saturday and 13 on Friday.
Of those quarantine cases, 24 had arrived on flights from India.

It follows revelations that Perth’s recent three-day lockdown was sparked by a man who was allowed to travel to India for his wedding before returning to Australia.
Overnight, Western Australia recorded four new hotel quarantine cases, all of which were linked to returned travellers from India. Another case is also under investigation.
Queensland reported two cases in the past 24 hours.
Airborne transmission risk needs to be addressed, says expert
Worryingly, there have been multiple instances of transmission between hotel quarantine guests in recent weeks.
UNSW’s head of biosecurity research, Professor Raina MacIntyre, told news.com.au that airborne transmission, particularly in hotel quarantine settings, poses a serious risk to Aussies.
“The next issue is addressing airborne transmission – sadly, this is denied by the national committee, ICEG, which advises AHPPC,” she said.
“As long as we deny airborne transmission, we cannot stop continual breaches in hotel quarantine. We need to address ventilation, use portable air cleaners, provide hotel quarantine staff with N95 respirators, and select quarantine venues based on the adequacy of ventilation.
Professor MacIntyre said these steps will reduce the ongoing leakages from hotel quarantine, adding “there is more at stake now” as more contagious COVID-19 variants are discovered internationally.

Numbers of hotel infections expected to rise further
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Premier Mark McGowan said he expects the number of infections in returned travellers to “grow significantly”, after confirming 78 of the 79 passengers on a flight to Perth on Saturday had been in India recently.
“This case and the other four confirmed cases in hotel quarantine all originate from flight MH125 that arrived from Kuala Lumpur into Perth on Saturday, 24 April,” he said.
“I have just been advised at this morning’s emergency management team meeting that 78 of the 79 passengers on this flight had been in India recently.
“Our expectation is the number of positive cases from this group of people will grow and potentially grow significantly.”
Mr McGowan said that he has “enormous sympathy for India” but said the situation is presenting challenges to his state and others.
“It’s obviously a diabolical situation that is going on in India at the moment, but it does put extreme pressure on our systems here in Western Australia and indeed in other states,” he said.
“I’m advised that other states are going through exactly the same experience.”
Morrison suspends flights to and from India
As the situation in India continues to deteriorate, the Australian Government has locked down international borders with India.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has suspended flights to and from the country, after announcing last week that flights from the country would be scaled back by 30 per cent.
“We recognise that this has been a very significant outbreak in India,” the Prime Minister told reporters, off the back of a national security committee meeting on Tuesday morning.
“Today we agreed, in addition to the measures that I announced after the last National Cabinet meeting, to pause direct passenger flights between India and Australia until the 15th of May.”
Professor MacIntyre told news.com.au that pausing international arrivals from India will help reduce hotel quarantine cases, however the Government still needed to offer more help to stranded Aussies.
“In 2020, most cases were people coming from the US and the UK, because the pandemic was severe there and we have a lot of travel from there. Currently the epidemic is severe in India, so reducing travel from India will help,” she said.
“However, a co-ordinated attempt to bring stranded Australians home from wherever they are is needed. At the moment, only people with financial means can come home with ease.
“We had charter flights and dedicated quarantine sites for people coming back from Wuhan last year. We know there are large numbers of stranded Australians all over the world who have been unable to get home – this is a humanitarian crisis that needs to be addressed.”

Fear and desperation have overcome thousands of Australians officially stranded in India after the government paused all incoming flights.

Australian resident Vamshidhar Parepalli, who is recovering from COVID-19, returned to India last year to care for his mother and told Sky News he had been stranded there for seven to eight months. 

Mr Parepalli said he has been feeling “totally helpless” since he cannot afford the tickets which are “very rarely available” to return to Australia. 

“The moment someone announces there are fights, the second moment they are gone, there are no tickets,” he said. 

“We’re not sure who’s booking them, everyone is stressed here in the Facebook groups and even in the worship groups for which I am admin.

“I’m not sure what exactly is happening and all of a sudden this second wave started in India and things are totally out of control”.

Australia’s High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell says there are approximately 9,000 Australians registered to come home and the number is expected to rise as flights from India have been stopped until the 15th of May.

“We have about 9,000 registered through the High Commission, we expect to see the number increase as it has over the past week obviously as anxiety over the unfolding pandemic,” he told Sky News. 

Mr O’Farrell said there were approximately 600 vulnerable Australians who are seeking to get home but said the vulnerability came from circumstances other than COVID-19.

“We will continue as we have over the past year at all four posts in India … to communicate with those Australians stranded in India.”

Australian Olympic and Paralympic athletes as well as their support staff will receive the COVID-19 vaccine under the existing Phase 1b allocation of the national rollout, Sports Minister Richard Colbeck told Sky News.

The Morrison government confirmed on Wednesday all athletes and support staff will receive the vaccination ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in July.

Minister Colbeck said the Australian Olympic Committee will supply the vaccines through a private contractor, but the allocation of both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines will be made as part of the national rollout.

“The decision’s been made by National Cabinet to bring the Olympians, Paralympians and support crews into category 1b as a part of that rollout,” he said.

The sports minister said his expectation was the athletes and support staff will undergo a quarantine process which will be “similar to everyone else”.

The quarantine program will look more like the system introduced for the Australian Open athletes who quarantined in hotels, rather than a hub-style which was adopted for AFL athletes in 2020, according to the minister.

“It’ll be much more like an Australian Open type exercise,” he said.

“It will be very much be a hotel quarantine type of system”.

Mr Colbeck said all discussions around quarantine will be conducted between the states and the AOC, but confirmed returning athletes would not be considered part of each state’s respective cap for returning Australians.

“The returning athletes are not within the caps that we have, they are a separate process which is exactly what happened with the Australian Open”.

Ricky Ponting says the Aussies in India are well aware of the COVID crisis and hopes the IPL can provide some positivity at a bleak time.
IPL: Bangalore have held on for an astonishing one run victory over the Delhi Capitols, winning with the last ball of the game.

Australian cricket great Ricky Ponting concedes it’s a “really strange” feeling being in India amid a COVID-19 crisis but hopes continuing the Indian Premier League proves a positive distraction for the struggling locals.
Ponting is coach of the Delhi Capitals, with fellow Aussies Steve Smith and Marcus Stoinis in his squad. All are likely to be stuck in India until the end of the tournament after a travel ban was put in place by the federal government.
The travel ban is in place until May 15. The group stage of the IPL is due to finish on May 23 with the final on May 30, and the Australians involved in the tournament could be forced to stick it out.
After his team lost a one-run thriller to Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday night, Ponting said his heart went out to all Indians and said the ban on travel for Aussies was only a “small part” of concerns.
“It’s a really strange feeling among our team right now,” Ponting said.
“We’re very aware of what’s happening outside and through greater India at the moment, and our hearts go out to every person in India that is struggling.
“We’ve had one of our players leave. Ravi Ashwin left to be with his family, so it has probably been affecting us, and we are talking about it more than most teams are.
“There have been some other revelations … with things our government have made as far as Australians returning.
“There’s no doubt there have been a few distractions along the way but the travel side of it for us Australians that are here is only a very small part of what we are talking about and what we are thinking about.
“We understand how blessed we are to be able to turn up and do what we did. Hopefully, there are a number of people around India that got some enjoyment out of watching a great game of IPL cricket.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison made it clear, when announcing the travel ban, that cricketers would not get special treatment.
“This wasn‘t part of an Australian tour,” he said.
“They’re under their own resources. And they’ll be using those resources to, I’m sure, to see them return to Australia in accordance with their own arrangements.”
Andrew Tye became the first Australian to leave the IPL last weekend, and both Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa are also trying to get home.
The pair gave up their six-figure contracts with the Royal Challengers Bangalore, but their plans to return home were derailed by Tuesday’s announcement.
While mystery surrounded the pair’s location earlier on Tuesday, it has been revealed both players are in Mumbai – away from their teammates – and are facing an uncertain future.
On Tuesday Tye said the bubble players were “safe”, but he wanted to get home.
“The bubble is very safe and very contained, so we didn’t really have too much idea what was going on other than what we were seeing on the TV or on social media really,” Tye told Network Ten’s The Project.
“I think it was the fact that things were happening in Australia, with hotel quarantine cases being so rough with cases from India. And then governments, state governments, sort of saying they want to back out of having flights from India land or cut down the number of people coming in from India.
“Obviously, some are trying to get out and others are quite happy and content to stay there and see the IPL out.
“I respect each and every one’s individual decisions and that’s their prerogative, and I did what was best for me.”

The boss of the Australian Olympic Committee has defended the decision to grant Olympic athletes early access to the COVID-19 vaccine ahead of the Tokyo Olympics amid accusations they are jumping the queue. 

AOC CEO Matt Carroll said there will be no extra burden imposed on the nation’s health system by administering the vaccines to the athletes who will be placed into the 1b category.  

“We’ve got the Australian Olympic team representing the country at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, so there’re travelling internationally, it’s very important we look after their health and safety,” Mr Carroll said. 

The government has insisted the move will not impact the national rollout and will not affect efforts to protect vulnerable Australians.

Health authorities are urgently working to fix a major flaw in Queensland’s hospitals that could expose frontline workers to COVID-19.
The pandemic has put a dent in efforts to cut back on plastic pollution as almost 20 billion disposable masks were used in the UK in the past 12 months. One company in Cardiff, Wales is working to turn discarded PPE into new garments including school chairs and toolboxes. Six NHS hospitals have already taken delivery of the specialist machines which convert used PPE into reusable plastic.

Queensland’s frontline nurses are at risk of being exposed to COVID-19, according to a statewide audit, which has found “systemic flaws” in personal protective equipment fit-testing.
The audit, carried out by the state’s health department, has prompted the Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union to demand nurses working with COVID-positive patients and those suspected of having the virus be kept safe.
The findings of the audit, presented to a hearing before the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission on Tuesday, revealed “widespread inconsistencies and deficiencies” in the rollout of PPE fit-testing protocols and practices currently being used at a number of the state’s hospitals and health services.
It comes as Queensland recorded nine new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, two of which were detected in overseas arrivals in hotel quarantine, the other seven on board a vessel that has arrived from Vanuatu.

A Queensland Health spokesman confirmed to NCA NewsWire that any health worker who came into contact with confirmed, or potential cases should “take every precaution, including wearing full PPE.”
QNMU Secretary Beth Mohle said Queensland Health needed to urgently develop and implement an action plan to rectify the problems uncovered in the audit.
“The data has clearly demonstrated what the QNMU has long feared, that there are huge inconsistencies in the PPE fit testing programs across our public health systems,” Ms Mohle said.
“Now that the problems have been identified, we are keen to focus on fixing the problems by working with QH to ensure that nurses working with COVID positive patients and others suspected of having the virus are kept safe and well.
“We also welcome the announcement by the Health Minister that QH intends to issue a direction requiring all staff working with COVID patients to be fit tested and fit checked at the start of each shift and subject to daily surveillance.”

The request for the audit came after three nurses and a doctor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital contracted the virus earlier this month, sparking a three-day lockdown across Greater Brisbane.
Ms Mohle said she also supported the announcement that all staff working with COVID patients would be fully vaccinated by May 10.
During the hearing on Monday, the QIRC Commissioner recommended that the top priority HHSs prepare “action plans” for PPE fit testing regimes by May 4, and submit them to the QNMU. Remaining HHSs will need to have their action plans developed by May 7.
Ms Mohle said she welcomed the opportunity to work with all HHSs to develop action plans that would keep staff, and all Queenslanders, safe.

“This is a particularly risky time now, over 12 months into the pandemic,” she said.
“So many are exhausted and continuing to deal with uncertainty and heavy workloads. This is a time when mistakes can be made, so we must all focus on implementing appropriate strategies to mitigate this high risk.
“There must be accountability and transparency in the HHS plans so we have confidence that we are keeping nurses and our communities safe.”

Australian Olympic bosses believe fast-tracked vaccinations for athletes make passage to Tokyo safe and they won’t be walking into a COVID-19 crisis.
Australian competitors and support staff attending the Tokyo Olympics have been granted early access to the COVID-19 vaccine. On Tuesday evening national cabinet agreed Australians involved in this year's Olympic Games will be prioritised under group 1B. It is hoped the move will offer some assurance as Japan moves through its third state of emergency.

Vaccinations for every Australian Olympic athlete mean they are no longer “dicing with death” by going to Tokyo despite expectations there will be athletes carrying the COVID-19 virus at the Games.
More than 2000 Australian Olympians and officials will be vaccinated before the Games after the federal government confirmed they would be fast-tracked amid fears they wouldn’t be allowed into Tokyo otherwise.
Australian Olympic Committee chief executive Matt Carroll said revelations the AOC had planned for a scenario in which 100 athletes would be in the athletes’ village carrying a variant of coronavirus made the jab even more important.
He tried to ease fears Australia’s Olympians were walking into a death trap and could bring the deadly virus home and said athletes could spend as little as five days in Tokyo.
“I don’t think we’re dicing with death at all,” Carroll said on Wednesday morning.
“The purpose of being vaccinated was to take away, as you described, dicing with death. I don’t believe that’s the case at all.
“That’s an analysis based on the numbers of people in the village. Obviously, as more countries get vaccinated that risk goes.
“The Japanese government and the organising committee have already got a lot of protocols in place, managing the people through the village. You can’t arrive until about 4-5 days before your competition, you leave 48 hours after. In fact, we’re working on getting the athletes out within 24 hours.

“The vaccination wasn’t just important for the team going to Tokyo, it means when we bring the athletes back and the officials back to Australia we’re also looking after the safety of Australians.”
Chartered flights will bring returning athletes home to Australia after the Olympics in July.
Carroll was emphatic the Games would still go ahead despite COVID-19 continuing to cause snap lockdowns in Japan and locals against the Olympics proceeding.
“We are confident it will go ahead,” he said.
“They (Japan) really want to host the Games, otherwise they just wouldn’t be there. They want to do it for the athletes of the world so they can come and compete, and for the world, it’s an opportunity to connect virtually and celebrate the power of sport. They are the reasons why they’re committed to making it happen, and it will happen.”

There are fears India’s growing outbreak is being severely under reported with some experts believing the death toll is much higher than the 3,000 fatalities recorded in the past day. 

The country is rapidly approaching 200,000 COVID-19 related deaths and hospitals are having to turn away thousands of seriously ill people due to shortages of oxygen and basic medical supplies. 

Many relatives of the deceased - who waited hours to get a funeral space - are convinced the tally of COVID-19 deaths is far higher than is being admitted. 

However the Indian government insists all figures are being faithfully recorded without interference.

Disturbing accusations claim India is lying about its COVID-19 cases, with new surveys and crematorium figures pointing to a much bigger crisis.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone – including vaccinated populations.

Health professionals have accused India of hiding the true number of COVID-19 deaths across the country, as it deals with a “tsunami” of new infections.
On Sunday, India recorded the highest daily increase in COVID-19 cases in the world with 352,991 new infections. And its second wave is showing no signs of stopping with 323,023 cases and 2771 deaths officially recorded on Tuesday.
However, there are fears these disturbing figures could be even higher than what is being officially reported.
Scientists have been using serology surveys to get a more accurate measure of infection rates, with a previous national survey showing the number of cases in India is likely “20 to 30 times higher than what had been reported”, according to CNN.

Applying this to India’s latest figures raises the estimated total infections for the country to 529 million cases, more than half a billion infections.
Director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi, Ramanan Laxminarayan, told the publication it was “widely known” the case numbers and death toll were being under-reported.
“Last year we estimated that only one in about 30 infections were being caught by testing, so the reported cases are a serious underestimate of true infections,” he said.
“This time, the mortality figures are probably serious underestimates, and what we’re seeing on the ground is many more deaths than what has been officially reported.”
Crematoriums overflowing with COVID victims
University of Michigan epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee labelled the COVID-19 figures coming out of India as a “complete massacre of data”.
She told The New York Times the modelling she and her colleagues have gathered suggest the number of deaths are at least double what officials are currently saying.
“From all the modelling we’ve done, we believe the true number of deaths is two to five times what is being reported,” Professor Mukherjee said.
Crematoriums across the country are overflowing, with some forced to build makeshift facilities in car parks.

RELATED: Rich Indians flee crisis on private jets
There have been multiple reports of discrepancies in the numbers being reported by crematoriums and the number of cremations actually taking place.
On April 17, the state of Gujarat claimed 78 COVID-19 deaths but newspapers reported 689 cremations linked to the virus took place across seven of the state’s cities that same day.
Similar complaints have also surfaced in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Suresh Bhai, a worker at one of the large cremation grounds in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, told The New York Times he had been instructed by his bosses to write “sickness” instead of COVID-19 on the documentation handed over to families of victims.
Doctors beg for help as hospitals overwhelmed
Hospitals are also being crushed under the new wave of infections, with limited supplies leaving doctors begging for help.
Over the past week, multiple Indian states have reported running out of medical oxygen, with patients dying as a result.
New Delhi medic, Dr Gautam Singh, posted a desperate video to social media on Sunday begging for critical medical supplies to keep his patients alive.
“Please send oxygen to us,” he said through a choked voice.
“My patients are dying.”
Trains carrying nearly 150 tonnes of liquid oxygen have been sent out to the worst-affected areas of the country.
Multiple countries have pledged aid to India, with the US and Britain rushing ventilators and vaccine materials to the country.

Footage of families burning the bodies of COVID-19 victims infected in India's second wave has been likened to scenes out of a "horror movie", according to Daily Telegraph health reporter Angira Bharadwaj.

Indian families reportedly don't have enough time in the day to burn bodies of COVID-19 victims as the country struggles to deal with the escalating crisis. 

Approximately 300,000 new cases were recorded in India today making global records for a sixth consecutive day in a row and the death count is rapidly approaching 200,000.

Ms Bharadwaj described the situation as a “humanitarian and healthcare crisis” which most health care systems would have difficulty managing.

She told Sky News about the experience of her own family currently living in India and said the “worst part” was the potential to lose family members in “really heartbreaking” circumstances.

“There’s not a lot of dignity in dying right now in India … families aren’t able to say goodbye to their loved ones in the way they would normally in other circumstances”.

Americans who have been fully vaccinated will be able to engage in outdoor activities without wearing a mask after the Center for Disease Control renewed its guidelines. 

More than half of adults in the United States have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The nation has administered 230 million jabs so far and President Joe Biden has used the new advice as an incentive to all Americans over the age of 16 to get vaccinated.

The president urged younger people who might not think they need the vaccine to "go get vaccinated now" so they could "do more things".

The wealthy are paying tens of thousands of dollars to fly out of India in a mass exodus as the virus crisis worsens and countries ban flights.
Outrage in India is growing amidst reports the country’s wealthiest are paying to charter private jets to flee the country to escape the COVID second wave.

Wealthy people in India have been escaping the country on private jets and commercial airfares are skyrocketing as the country’s COVID-19 crisis worsens and international borders snap shut.
Indian tycoons and rich families have reportedly fled India for boltholes across Europe, the Middle East and Indian Ocean destinations such as the Maldives, which will ban flights from India on Tuesday, sparking a last-minute rush.
Australia will suspend passenger flights from India until May 15, the federal government announced on Tuesday, and Canada, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the UK have already done the same.

Ranbir Kapoor - Bollywood’s sixth highest paid actor - has been slammed after brazenly sharing pictures on Instagram with his girlfriend Alia Bhatt as they arrived at Mumbai airport on April 19, with the caption “Maldives calling”, The Sun reports.
Both had reportedly only just recovered from coronavirus themselves before hopping on a plane.
They joined fellow Bollywood stars Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff, who jetted off to the Maldives the day before as India continued to battle with devastating infection rates.
While Ranbir, Alia, 28, and Tiger kept a low profile on social media during their trip, Disha, 28, splashed bikini-clad pictures and selfies on her Instagram.

Wealthy Indians are paying as much as 1.5 million rupees, or more than $A25,800, for a one way flight out of India, which includes ground handling and other fees, said Rajan Mehra, the chief executive officer of the New Delhi-based private jet firm Club One Air.
“It’s not only the ultra rich,” he told Bloomberg.
“Whoever can afford to take a private jet are taking private jets.”
Mr Mehra said in some cases, travellers would have to pay extra if the plane needed to be sent back to India empty.
UAE authorities imposed a 10-day ban on flights from India on Sunday. Previously, the Delhi-Dubai route was one of the busiest in the world.
A spokesman for Air Charter Service India told AFP the demand for private jets was “absolutely crazy” before the ban came into effect.
Another provider, Enthral Aviation, got close to 80 inquiries for flights to Dubai in a single day.
“We have requested more aircraft from abroad to meet the demand,” a spokesman for Enthral Aviation told AFP.
“It costs $US38,000 ($A49,000) to hire a 13-seater jet from Mumbai to Dubai, and $US31,000 ($A40,000) to hire a six-seater aircraft.
“People are making groups and arranging to share our jets just to get a seat … We’ve had some queries for Thailand but mostly the demand is for Dubai.”

Commercial airline prices are soaring as seats on flights out of India become harder to come by. In the final days before the UAE’s flight ban came into effect, a one-way flight in economy class from Mumbai to Dubai cost as much as $1600 — more than ten times the regular price.
But as the country continues to set new records for infections and the hospital system threatens to crumble, it’s a price many of the wealthy have been willing to pay.
“That shows how desperately people are trying to get away,” Mr Mehra said.
On Tuesday India recorded a massive rise in virus cases, with 323,144 new infections and 2771 deaths, bringing the caseload to more than 17.6 million.

As Aussies remain stranded in India while COVID-19 ravages the country, those contemplating coming home have been urged to stay put.
IPL: Adam Zampa, Kane Richardson and Andrew Tye have decided to opt out of the IPL season and will return to Australia as cases spike in India.

Indian Premier League chiefs sought to reassure foreign cricket stars in the tournament that they are “totally safe” even as the country battles a devastating coronavirus surge.
With many nations restricting travel from India and Prime Minister Scott Morrison announcing on Tuesday that flights to and from India have been suspended until May 15, organisers of the world’s richest cricket tournament also vowed to make sure that all players get home once the league is over.

With more than 350,000 cases and 2750 deaths per day, three Australian players have left their IPL teams in recent days. Others still in India admit they are on edge over the deadly surge.
“We understand that there are (a) few apprehensions and concerns regarding the general situation in India and the withdrawals of certain cricketers,” said acting Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief Hemang Amin in an email sent to players and coaches.
“We completely respect the decision taken by the players and extend our support to them in every way.
“At the same time, we would also assure you that you are totally safe within the bubble.”
Amin said the bio-secure bubbles which the players have been kept in had been strengthened because of the new fears.
All players and coaches are now tested every two days instead of every five, and outside food deliveries to team hotels have been banned.
“I am sure you will understand and co-operate with us on these steps,” he said, adding that player safety was “of paramount importance”.
The BCCI chief added “India faces unprecedented challenges stretching its healthcare and spirit” as he urged players to stick with the tournament.
“When you all walk out onto the field, you are bringing hope to millions of people who have tuned in,” said Amin.
“This time you are also playing for something much more important … humanity.”

Amin also acknowledged players’ worries about how they will go home when the tournament ends on May 30, saying that was “natural and understandable”.
Australians Adam Zampa, Kane Richardson and AJ Tye left the tournament this week but there are still 14 of their compatriots left with the eight teams, including David Warner, Steve Smith, Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell.
Some of the Aussie players are on contracts worth millions of dollars, including Maxwell ($2.52m), Riley Meredith ($1.42m) and Jhye Richardson ($2.48m).
Chris Lynn has demanded that the Australian government lay on a charter flight for players at the end of the IPL, but this has been rejected.
Eleven English players — including one-day captain Eoin Morgan and top stars Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler — and 10 South Africans — including AB de Villiers and bowler Kagiso Rabada — are still playing.
“We want to apprise you that you have nothing to worry about,” Amin said in the email.
“The BCCI will do everything to ensure that you reach your respective destinations seamlessly.”

US President Joe Biden leaves after speaking about updated CDC guidance on masks

Americans vaccinated against Covid-19 no longer need to mask up outdoors when there is no crowd, President Joe Biden said Tuesday, before celebrating by taking his first short walk at the White House without the face covering.
Although he walked out of the White House to his podium on the lawn wearing a black mask, he walked back without.

Speaking about the latest change to US coronavirus guidelines, Joe Biden was asked a curly question. His answer didn’t take long.

The US government has officially relaxed its guidance on mask-wearing, telling Americans they no longer need to use face coverings in most situations outdoors as long as they have been fully vaccinated.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now says it is safe for people vaccinated against COVID-19 to go maskless unless they are attending a crowded outdoor event, like a concert or a game of sport.
“If you are fully vaccinated and want to attend a small, outdoor gathering with people who are vaccinated or unvaccinated, or dine at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households, you can do so safely unmasked,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said today, describing it as a “step back to the normalcy of before”.
“If you are fully vaccinated, things are much safer for you than those who are not yet fully vaccinated.”
According to the latest figures, 96 million Americans have been fully vaccinated so far, more than half of the nation’s adults have received at least one shot, and an average of three million doses are being administered each day.
Nationwide, anyone aged 16 or over is currently eligible to receive the vaccines.

If you are fully vaccinated against #COVID19, you can start doing many things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. If you haven’t been vaccinated yet, get a vaccine as soon as you can. See full details: https://t.co/s5kXwg65fBpic.twitter.com/fvhehUiiCi
Speaking to reporters from the sunny North Lawn of the White House this afternoon, President Joe Biden framed the updated guidance as another reason for Americans to get fully vaccinated as quickly as possible.
“Earlier today, the CDC made an important announcement,” Mr Biden said.
“If you’re fully vaccinated and outdoors, and not in a big crowd, you no longer need to wear a mask. If you’re in a crowd, like a stadium or concert, you still need to wear a mask, even if you’re outside.
“Beginning today, gathering with a group in the park, going for a picnic, as long as you are vaccinated and outdoors, you do not need to wear a mask.
“The odds of giving the virus to others is very, very low if you’ve been fully vaccinated and are outdoors.
“If you’re vaccinated, you can do more things, more safely, both outdoors and indoors.
“If you haven’t got it yet, or think you don’t need it, this is another reason to go and get vaccinated, now. Yes, the vaccines are about saving our life and the lives of people around you, but they’re also about getting us back to a more normal way of living.
“So go get the shot. It’s never been easier. And once you’re fully vaccinated, you can go without a mask when you’re outside and away from big crowds.
“Don’t let up now. Keep following the guidance. Go get your vaccination now.”

Vaccine hesitancy remains an issue for the US, with public polling consistently showing at least a fifth of adults do not intend to get the shots.
Mr Biden himself has been fully vaccinated. A reporter asked why he had worn a mask while walking outside to the lectern, implying inconsistency in his messaging about the new guidelines.
“Sir, you chose to wear a mask as you walked out here. What message were you sending by wearing a mask outside, alone?” said NBC correspondent Peter Alexander.
Mr Biden replied with a single sentence, and a grin.
“By watching me take it off, and not put it back on until I get back inside,” he said.
He did remain maskless as he walked back into the building.

While optimistic, the President did also urge Americans to remain cautious.
“We still have a long way to go in this fight,” he said.
“(But) we’ve made stunning progress because of all of you, the American people. Cases and deaths are down dramatically from where they were when I took office, and are continuing to fall.
“When I took office in January, we were losing literally tens of thousands of our seniors each week. At that time, less than 1 per cent of seniors were fully vaccinated. Today, in less than 100 days, more than 67 per cent of our seniors are fully vaccinated, and more than 80 per cent have had one shot.
“Instead of losing thousands of seniors each day, we’re saving thousands of lives, and more and more as each day goes by.”

Indian authorities said tankers of liquid oxygen were en route to the state of Madhya Pradesh on April 27, as the country’s hospitals grappled with a spike in COVID-19 cases. The Animal Husbandry Department of Madhya Pradesh said the oxygen was collected from a plant in Angul, Odisha, and would be brought to Madhya Pradesh. The Madhya Pradesh public relations office said the Animal Husbandry Department tankers would bring oxygen to various cities in Madhya Pradesh, including Guna, Chhatarpur, Jabalpur, and Sagar.

Residents of Lucknow, India, lined up to get oxygen tanks refilled on April 26, as cases of COVID-19 soared across the country. The newspaper The Hindu said locals in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, reported waiting in line with “crowds” of others for as long as eight hours to refill oxygen tanks, sparking concerns of superspreading. COVID-19 cases have dramatically spiked in India over the past week, with a seven-day infection rate in excess of 300,000. The country recorded 323,144 new cases on Tuesday, short of the record 352,991 cases on Monday. The Ministry of Railways said they have repurposed 4,000 train carriages as COVID treatment units and transported tankers filled with liquid oxygen to help supply hospitals struggling with low supplies.

Millionaires are fleeing on private jets with the rest of India’s population in a COVID crisis. So, what can we Aussies do to help?
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone - including vaccinated populations.

India’s second wave has officially reached breaking point with the country’s healthcare system overrun by a whopping 350,000 new cases per day.
Images of bodies piling up -— up to 2,800 daily — have flooded the world press in recent weeks. Indian tycoons and rich families are now reportedly fleeing the nation for boltholes across Europe, the Middle East and Indian Ocean destinations. Unfortunately for the rest of the nation’s 1.4 billion population who don’t own private jets, the situation remains dire.
The pseudo-apocalyptic scene begs the question: What can we Aussies do to help?

Australia’s federal government met this week to discuss sending excess ventilators to the struggling nation, but there are things the average citizen can do, too.
Aussie cricketer Pat Cummins turned heads on Tuesday after donating $50,000 to Indian hospitals. Vowing to see out the Indian Premier league as other Aussies flee home, Cummins said he was “touched by India’s passion and generosity”, contributing some of his Knight Riders pay packet to purchasing oxygen supplies for the country’s hardest hit areas.
While most Aussies don’t have a spare 50 grand to throw around, there are still ways we can help our mates in the subcontinent going through the worst coronavirus wave on record.
Here are some of the charities you can donate to right now to help save lives across the pond.
Ketto
#COVID#OxygenCrisis#OxygenShortageAs the covid situation is getting worse by the day, there is shortage of oxygen. Your support can help hospitals save their patient’s lives. Please help.@RanaAyyubhttps://t.co/QrYnociPws

As pandemic travel restrictions drag on, people who live far away from ageing parents are struggling with feelings of guilt and helplessness.
Some simple coronavirus health questions you can ask your aged care provider to learn more about the safety of your elderly loved ones.

The world has shrunk in recent years as international travel became cheaper and faster — but COVID-19 has raised the barriers all over again.
As pandemic travel restrictions drag on, people who live long distances from ageing parents are feeling increasingly helpless and worried about them.
Katie Raleigh, who is originally from Ireland and has been living in Sydney for a decade, was due to visit her relatives in March 2020 but her flights were cancelled.
“I haven’t seen my family for three years now,” she told news.com.au. “Living on the other side of the world was never something I thought about until I literally couldn’t get back to Ireland. As lockdown over there has gone on, I’ve felt guilty that supporting my parents is falling to my siblings, and there’s not much I can do.”
The 37-year-old’s parents both have ongoing health issues, and she’s been speaking to them more than ever. “It was important to me that my family knows I can be called on for help,” she said.

RELATED: How to protect the elderly from COVID-19
Not only are older people more at risk of severe effects of COVID-19, they also face added challenges in terms of isolation and mental health.
The World Health Organisation has warned that older people across the world continue to be “challenged” by requirements to stay at home, lack of physical contact with friends and family, a cessation of their usual activities, and anxiety over illness and death.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for “improved social support and smarter efforts to reach older people”.
Jessica Silver is the co-founder of ElWell, a UK-based online hub for caregivers that has begun offering specific support to expats across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s always a tricky dynamic when the tables turn and children need to start ‘parenting their parents’ — and distance can make it harder,” she tells news.com.au. “It’s so personal when it’s your family and hard to see the wood for the trees, especially when you live abroad.”
Ms Silver, who lived in Sydney before moving home to the UK, says she “understands the difficulty that comes with seeing your parents get older from afar”, and has found that these feelings have intensified for expats during the pandemic.

Some are only children who need to take control from the other side of the world, while others want to support siblings and other family members in a useful way, helping to make crucial decisions.
Ms Silver and ElWell co-founder Nancy Farmer, a physiotherapist, have created a checklist to help the “sandwich generation” care for elderly parents — even if they live thousands of kilometres away.
Here are their top tips on how expats can support ageing parents:
1. Look for signs: Use your time on the phone or video calls to pick up on any cues that your parents are starting to struggle. Are they acting forgetful? Or does it look like their home is messier than normal? If there’s anything that’s cause for concern, start a Notes section on your phone and monitor it.
2. Speak with your siblings: If you’re lucky enough to have family support on the ground, then speak with them about what you’re thinking. See if they agree (or have other things to add) and remind them that although you live overseas, you want to be as involved as you can be.
3. The talk: It may be time for you and your siblings to talk with your parents about how they really are. Arrange a time that works for all time zones, and tell mum and dad why you want the chat. The overriding sentiment to communicate is that you’re here for them and looking for solutions. Use conversation starters and try to let them lead the chat. What you want is to all raise the noted areas of concern, see if they agree (or if they have other pressing worries) and then collectively agree on next steps.
4. Divide and conquer: While siblings may be able to help your parents on the ground, you can still research and send useful products, look into local resources and find external help. Ask what would make life easier for them — can you sort food delivery or agree a time to consistently ring your parents so some of the pressure is taken off your siblings? You could even do things for a brother or sister if they have to suddenly spend more time helping mum and dad.
5. Plan ahead: Conversations about the future are confronting, but important to have. If the worst happens, think about what you would need to sort out. From their utility providers to all their digital passwords, knowing this information will make your life easier down the track. Start a spreadsheet in Google Drive — you can easily share it with the family.
6. Help them get power of attorney: This legal document is one of the most important things anyone can set up that may never be used but is there if someone can’t make their own decisions (e.g. with dementia). If your parent becomes unwell, you can’t just access their bank accounts to pay for their care, or make health-related decisions for them. Only their attorney can. Even if you live abroad, you can still be named your parent’s POA (although it may help to share this with a sibling).

Australia’s response to the pandemic has allowed the vast majority of loan holders to return to normal repayments, the nation’s peak banking body says.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will meet 15 bank executives today to discuss Australia’s pandemic recovery plan. COVID stimulus, cyber security and anti-money laundering priorities will top the agenda when the group meets in Canberra. New data shows borrowers have resumed repayments on 96.5 per cent of deferred loans. Just 1.2 per cent of small business and five per cent of housing loans remain frozen. Banks are cautious of upcoming pressure points as lending assistance measures and JobKeeper come to an end.

The majority of loans placed in deep freeze as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have resumed normal repayments, Australia’s peak banking body says.
As at March 31, only 0.5 per cent of the almost 1 million loans that had been deferred due to COVID-19 hardship remained that way, the Australian Banking Association has revealed.
According to the ABA, just 3170 home loans and 508 small business loans are still on hold after industry-wide measures were brought in to assist households and firms at the peak of the economic downturn.
ABA chief executive Anna Bligh said the numbers were a positive reminder of how well Australia had shielded itself from the worst of the financial onslaught caused by the global pandemic.

“These figures reflect the impressive recovery Australia’s economy is experiencing after facing a one-in-100-year pandemic,” Ms Bligh said.
“The fact that unemployment is lower than expected and the economy has rebounded faster than we anticipated is great news for the vast majority of homeowners and small businesses.”
At the height of the pandemic, Australia’s banking industry installed deferral periods of up to six months for mortgage and small business loan customers who had experienced financial hardship as a result of the nation’s first recession in 30 years.
The deferral period has ended, but banks are offering further support to customers and businesses still battling from the effects of the virus.

“Banks will continue to support those households and businesses still doing it tough this year, taking a fair and compassionate approach to get people through the pandemic,” Ms Bligh said.
Loan deferrals peaked last year in June with 854,606 loans paused across the four major banks and Suncorp.
According to the ABA, Victoria has the highest proportion of small business and mortgages still on deferral.

Additional pyres were being built in a park near a Delhi crematorium on April 26, The Hindu reported, as COVID deaths in India mounted. Families have had to wait up to six hours to cremate loved ones at Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan Crematorium, according to The Hindu. A staff member at the crematorium told The Hindu that it was “operating from 6 am to midnight” to accommodate “the surge in COVID-related deaths.” India had recorded 17,636,307 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 197,894 deaths as of April 26, according to government officials. This footage was filmed by local journalist Sohil Sehran. He said it showed, “Cremation platforms being build outside Sarai Kale Khan crematorium to accommodate for the rising #COVID19 death toll.” Credit: Sohil Sehran via Storyful

Australian athletes in the Olympics will be able to get COVID-19 jabs before the games, with ‘some’ who may beat vulnerable priority groups.
The Tokyo Olympics is currently facing spiralling costs, a weary public and the ongoing global impact of the pandemic.

Australian competitors in the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will be given access to coronavirus vaccines before they depart, meaning some may jump the original national rollout queue.
The Olympics begin in late July, with the Paralympics following a month later, and most athletes would not have had their jab until later this year under the previous, stalled rollout plan.
But in a joint statement on Tuesday, Senator Richard Colbeck and Health Minister Greg Hunt said the competitors and their support staff would be classed under priority group 1b.
The group includes elderly people aged over 70, Indigenous people aged over 55, and critical and high risk workers including defence personnel and police.
Supplies of the COVID-19 vaccine will be made available to about 2050 competitors.
“We want to see our athletes head to Tokyo to compete and then return to Australia safely,” Minister Hunt said.
Senator Colbeck said vulnerable Australians remained “an absolute priority” but high-performance athletes had been facing pressure as the games drew closer.

“This will be a very different Olympics and Paralympics, but our athletes deserve the opportunity to compete,” he said.
The Australian Olympic Committee welcomed the decision, which was made by national cabinet.
“There will be hundreds of very grateful athletes, coaches and their families relieved to know that their hard work over five years has been worth it,” chief executive Matt Carroll said on Tuesday.
“This added layer of assurance is what they were seeking.
“The AOC will be working with our partners Aspen Medical on the logistics to ensure the vaccination of our athletes does not place any additional load on the public system.”
Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy told Senate estimates the federal government wanted the athletes vaccinated by the middle of the year.
Asked if they would jump ahead of other priority groups, Professor Murphy replied: “There may be some”.
Senator Colbeck had earlier told the ABC it was “without question” the competitors would be exposed to the virus at the events.

“And so, we want to make sure that they’re in the best possible circumstances,” he told the broadcaster.
Asked if the public would tolerate the possibility of sports people or others involved in the games being vaccinated “before their elderly parents or their friend with a disability”, Senator Colbeck said the national rollout was advancing despite constraints.
“I think as long as people are confident that those that need access, want access to the vaccine that they’re able to get it, that considerations such as athletes travelling to an event like the games, they’ll be content with that as a consideration,” he said.

Trains carrying tankers filled with liquid oxygen continued to supply hospitals struggling with low supplies in COVID-hit India on April 27. The Times of India reported a total of 450 tons delivered so far under the scheme. This footage, released by the Ministry of Railways, shows an “Oxygen Express” train passing through a station on its way to Madhya Pradesh. The Ministry of Railways also said 4,000 train carriages had been repurposed as COVID treatment units. India has seen COVID-19 cases spike over the past week, with a seven-day infection rate in excess of 300,000.

The Australian Hotels Association has called on the McGowan Government to compensate the hospitality sector for helping ensure the State’s coffers continue to be filled by mining royalties.
Despite the end of the lockdown on Monday, hospitality businesses such as Market Grounds remain closed this week because they are unable to turn a profit under the McGowan Government’s 20-patron COVID limit, which won’t be lifted until Saturday at the earliest.
AHA WA chief executive Bradley Woods told The West Live it was “totally unaffordable” for many venues to operate with such a miniscule capacity.
“The cost of operating will far exceed the revenue that they could achieve,” Mr Woods said.
“Importantly, it’s not just businesses that will lose out here, it’s tens of thousands of people working in the sector across Perth and Peel, who may not have work this week.”
Mr Woods said the hospo sector was willing to play its part in keeping WA COVID-free, but there was a disparity in how evenly the responsibility and lost revenue was shared across the State’s various industries.
“We’re not the only ones affected — gyms and entertainment centres; cinemas and theatres are also affected ... it is a broad spectrum of the service sector of Western Australia,” he said.
“And it’s not unreasonable to consider that by them being closed they are in effect reducing spread, which is what the purpose of all of this is, in order to keep the royalties flowing to the State Government from the mining sector.

“FIFO continued to operate over the weekend, which is great, it’s supporting our economy, but, at the same time, we want to see some support for those sectors that have been hit so hard by the lockdown.”
The impact of restrictions is being more keenly felt without the safety net of JobKeeper, so Mr Woods urged the Premier to do better than the $500 credit the State Government applied to power bills in its last attempt to provide compensation to small business.
“That didn’t really touch the surface,” Mr Woods said of the credit scheme.
“Across the hospitality sector, the tens of thousands of workers that are going to go without wages this week, and those businesses — a $500 credit off their power is just not going to cut it.”

As India continues to grapple with a “tsunami” of COVID-19 cases, deaths and dwindling medical supplies, experts have warned it could spell catastrophe for us all.
Delays to a more equal global coronavirus vaccine distribution will affect everyone – including vaccinated populations.

Despite India’s insistence, just weeks ago, that it was “in the endgame” of its battle against COVID-19, experts have warned for months that the nation of 1.4 billion people was a ticking time bomb.
And now that that bomb has well and truly exploded – leaving a “tsunami” of coronavirus cases, escalating deaths and dwindling medical supplies in its wake – experts are warning the devastation could have a knock-on effect for the rest of the world.
After recording the worst single-day increase in cases in any country since the pandemic began on Sunday, with 352,991 new infections, India reported another 323,000 cases and 2771 deaths, with no signs of slowing down.
“All the arrows are pointing to real darkness,” University of Michigan epidemiologist and biostatician, Bhramer Mukherjee, told The Atlantic.
As the world’s largest vaccine producer, 92 developing nations rely on India’s Serum Institute for the doses needed to protect their own populations – a supply that has now been constrained by India’s domestic obligations.
The Institute, which is the manufacturer of the AstraZeneca vaccine, has already said it will not be able to meet its international commitments amid India’s domestic shortage, with the country forced to import doses.

On top of that, COVID-19 is continuing to mutate - experts fear that double and possibly triple-mutant strains could be driving India’s latest surge, prompting concerns the same situation will soon spread further afield.
Efforts to restrict the spread of the B. 1.617 variant, which originated in India, haven’t been enough to prevent its detection in at least 10 other countries, including Britain and America.
Speaking to Business Insider, Professor Mukherjee said that India’s “premature celebration of victory” should serve as a warning to other countries who are seeing case numbers decline.
“The double mutant is now in California, it is in the UK, and similar variants are going to circulate all over the world,” she said.
“It’s really a global problem.”

Local media outlets are reporting long lines at hospitals, ventilator and oxygen shortages and bodies piling up at crematoriums – a situation that might not have been as bad, experts said, if the country had been quicker on its local vaccine distribution and hadn’t loosened social distancing restrictions.
“Many people were thinking by December, January, ‘Oh, we’ve got this under control’,” University of Toronto epidemiologist Prabhat Jha told the publication.
“That turned out to be just hubris and I, among others, had warned that it could really bite back.
“The real lesson here is: respect the virus, respect science. There’s no other way out.”

On Tuesday afternoon, Prime Minister Scott Morrisonannounced that all direct flights to and from India to Australia would be suspended until May 15, calling the crisis there “a rapidly escalating situation”.
Also announcing that we will send urgently-needed medical supplies there, the PM cautioned against viewing people coming from India through a racial lens or as a “problem we have to solve”. More than 9000 Australians remain in India and want to come home, with 650 of those considered vulnerable.
“These are Australians and Australian residents who need our help and we intend to make sure we are able to restore flights, particularly the repatriation flights, and that those repatriating flights focus on the most vulnerable,” he told reporters.
“We don’t think the answer is to forsake those Australians in India and just shut them off, as some seem to suggest. That’s not what my government is going to do.”
But Assistant Professor at the Medical University of South Carolina, Krutika Kuppalli, warned that “if India doesn’t get their pandemic under control, it affects the whole world”.
“We can put all the travel restrictions we want, but that’s not going to prevent these mutations from getting to other places.”

A damning investigation has slammed the Victorian government’s handling of an important coronavirus recovery initiative - initially only staffed with 5 people.
The COVID-19 debacle in Victoria means Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will be extra generous when he hands down the government’s economic statement next week, according to The Australian’s Paul Kelly.

Thousands of Victorian businesses struggling to pay bills have missed out on millions of dollars in COVID-19 entitlements after the Victorian government bungled the approvals process, an investigation has found.
About 12,000 businesses were denied up to $120 million because their applications remained in draft awaiting further information when the deadline expired, with others unfairly denied a grant on other grounds such as application typos or information being provided through an incorrect link.
The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions’ call centre, initially staffed with only five people, could not handle the volume of requests, and was later not given access to the Department’s case management fund.
The shocking findings were published following a Victorian Ombudsman investigation into the Business Support fund, which received more than 1000 complaints.
Premier Daniel Andrews said the support package would help businesses recover - but the Ombudsman found the execution left much to be desired. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Andrew HenshawSource:News Corp Australia
The government set up the fund in nine days, aimed at providing critical financial support to struggling businesses during the state’s first and second lockdowns.
Premier Daniel Andrews announced the “massive new support package” in September.
“For our state to recover, we need our businesses to recover too. As we take our first safe and steady steps towards COVID Normal, this support will help make sure we get through this together,” Mr Andrews said at the time.
“We’ll continue meeting with and listening to businesses, so we can do everything we can to support them and their workers.”
But Ombudsman Deborah Glass said the execution of the fund left much to be desired.

“The COVID-19 lockdowns fell like a hammer blow on small businesses,” Ms Glass said.
“There was desperation in people’s voices, they were counting on a grant to pay bills, rent, wages - to survive.
“Despite the stress and anxiety caused by COVID-19, in an environment where their businesses were being destroyed, people were being penalised for their honest mistakes.”
Ms Glass has made several key recommendations including inviting almost 12,000 businesses whose applications were rejected to reapply for the fund.
She said the Department unreasonably refused some applications, refusing to reassess them even after the Ombudsman highlighted the harshness of its decisions.
“The aim of the fund was laudable, to support a hugely vulnerable cohort affected by lockdown. But administering it inflexibly undermined its very purpose,” Ms Glass said.
“The people were forgotten in the process.”
The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions said it would reopen the fund for eligible businesses that were denied the $10,000 grant.
Deputy Premier James Merlino said the department accepted all of the recommendations and would contact businesses over this week.
“To those businesses, I know this has been an inconvenience… rest assured, your applications are being reassessed right now,” he told reporters.
“There was some issues, but importantly the department has accepted the recommendations and those businesses will be contacted.
“This was a critical part of our response to the pandemic.”

The ASX once again dipped as pandemic concerns hit travel stocks and tech stocks lagged, but acquisition action was an encouraging sign.

The Australian sharemarket closed in the red for the second straight day, with travel stocks among those weighing on the market as alarm over India’s COVID-19 outbreak mounted.
The S&P/ASX200 finished 0.17 per cent lower at 7033.8 while the All Ordinaries Index dipped 0.17 per cent to 7295.5.
“It’s quite a slow start we’ve had to this trading week,” CommSec analyst Steve Daghlian said.
“Still the good news at the moment is that this is the best month that we’ve had so far in 2021, as long as we can avoid a significant and nasty decline.”
If that doesn’t happen, it would be the seventh straight month of gains, Mr Daghlian said.
“The question, I guess, is whether or not we can gain enough momentum to get us to those record highs which the market has struggled to really get to.
“Every time it has been approaching the best levels on record, it has been fading a bit.”
OpenMarkets Group chief executive Ivan Tchourilov said tech stocks dragged, led by buy-now-pay-later stocks.
Market leader Afterpay declining 5.53 per cent to $115.96, smaller rival Zip gave up 6.31 per cent to $8.02 and accounting software provider Xero backtracked 2.24 per cent to $139.55.

“OpenMarkets traders are seeing the pullback in tech as an opportunity, with Zip being the single most purchased stock today, followed closely by Fortescue,” Mr Tchourilov said.
Fortescue lifted 1.15 per cent to $22.96, Evolution Mining rose 3 per cent to $4.80, Rio Tinto firmed 0.92 per cent to $123.64 and BHP put on 1.13 per cent to $48.38.
Rio Tinto announced external affairs and chief legal officer Barbara Levi had accepted the position of group general counsel at UBS and would leave the miner by the end of October.
BHP spin-off South32 gained 0.7 per cent to $2.89 after releasing a mixed March quarter production report but Macquarie Research said cash flow was better than expected.
Nickel Mines, however, plunged 12.06 per cent to $1.13 after reporting a near 13 per cent slump in quarterly production and sharply lower earnings.

In the healthcare sector, biotech giant CSL erased 1.24 per cent to $268.37.
Travel stocks came under pressure, with Sydney Airport falling 1.94 per cent to $6.06, Corporate Travel Management shedding 3.11 per cent to $19.01 and Flight Centre losing 1.37 per cent to $17.27.
“We’re still having of course concerns over coronavirus even though we’ve had the three-day snap lockdown lifted in Perth last night - there are concerns about the outbreak in India with something like 350,000 cases being identified per day at the moment,” Mr Daghlian said.
Other big news was the federal government suspending passenger flights between India and Australia until May 15.

Tabcorp said it had not yet formed a view on the improved proposal.
“It’s been a busy day in the M&A (mergers and acquisitions) space today, which is a healthy sign for the overall market,” Mr Tchourilov said.
“When deals of this nature are going on, it indicates business confidence and that things are improving.”

In Victoria 12,000 businesses missed out on vital COVID-19 support packages during last year’s second wave due to technical issues in the state government’s business support fund.

The $10,000 business grants were meant to provide relief to small businesses impacted by the extended lockdown but some business owners were refused payment over typing errors and IT issues.

The Victorian ombudsman says people were let down when they were most vulnerable.

Aussies will now be prevented from flying to India for weddings and funerals as the nation reels from an escalating COVID-19 crisis.
With the unfolding COVID-19 crisis in India, Scott Morrison agrees to pause direct and indirect flights to and from India.

Australia will bar citizens from flying to India for weddings and funerals in the wake of a “tsunami” of COVID-19 cases and fury over outbreaks in hotel quarantine facilities at home.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the tough new rules on outbound travel today as he confirmed a snap ban on incoming flights until May 15.
The decision reflects demands from the states for much tougher rules for outbound travel to COVID-19 hot spots. Travel will be restricted to essential travel only including national interest, medical exemption and COVID purposes.
Government sources confirmed the new rules will ban travel to India for weddings and funerals.
It follows revelations that a man who went to India for his own wedding before returning to Australia and sparking a COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia was able to prove “profound” reasons for travel, according to Health Minister Greg Hunt.
Perth was plunged into a three-day lockdown on Friday after community transmission was linked to a man who returned from India, which is in the middle of a destructive spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

The man arrived in Perth from India on April 10 with his new bride. He tested positive at the Mercure Hotel three days later.
The virus then spread to his wife and seeped into other rooms across the corridor, infecting three people including a child.
As COVID-cases surged to 350,000 a day in India, the Prime Minister confirmed the national security committee had taken decisive action – but the dramatic move could leave some Australian cricketers stranded.
“Today we agreed to pause flights,’’ the Prime Minister said.
Cricketers who did not join an early exodus from the Indian Premier League will not be prioritised over other citizens.
There are currently 9000 Australians registered in India who want to come home with 600 regarded as “vulnerable”.
Those numbers are expected to grow in coming days as some families rush to get out.
When questioned about the cricketers in particular, Mr Morrison said they had travelled to India “privately”.
“It’s done on vulnerability and they’ve travelled there privately, under those arrangements - this wasn’t part of an Australia tour and they are under their own resources and they will be using those resources to I’m sure see them return to Australia,” he said.

REALTED: Flight delays leads to 14 day quarentine
Last week the Prime Minister announced a 30 per cent reduction in both commercial flights and repatriation flights as a result of discussions in national cabinet but today’s announcement of a flight ban renders those reductions moot.
Foreign Affairs minister Marise Payne said eight DFAT repatriation flights planned to return from India in May would now be paused.
“We know this is a very difficult time,’’ she said.
The snap ban will affect around 500 travellers immediately and is likely to remain in place until May 15.
Australia will also rush a massive humanitarian package including oxygen, masks and surgical gowns to India to help fight the pandemic.
Australia’s High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell has described the new COVID-19 crisis as a “tsunami” after India grappled with the first wave.
“Then bang, along comes a second wave which is more tsunami than ripple,’’ he said.
WA Premier Mark McGowan flagged the likely flight ban this morning, describing the decision as the right call.

“Well, I think the Commonwealth is looking at suspending flights out of India, which is a good thing for this period,’’ he said.
“It’s very sad and very difficult to say because people in India are no doubt not happy about being there and it’s obviously a risk for them but it’s also a risk to our hotel quarantine system and you can see the consequences when there’s a problem because we just had the consequence over the course of the last three days.”
The big concern now is people flying to another country to beat the Indian flight ban.
“If someone leaves India and gets on a flight in Singapore, Doha, London or wherever it might be back to Australia, that suspension of flights from India clearly doesn’t apply to them,’’ Mr McGowan said.
“That’s why we need to ensure that the integrity of our testing regime – that is, people getting tested with verifiable and accurate tests in those other locations – is put in place.”
Mr McGowan raised concerns on Tuesday over “dodgy” tests in India declaring travellers COVID-free.

“If the test is not accurate or a bit dodgy that is impinging the integrity of the system,” he said.
“It’s obviously a diabolic situation that is going on in India at the moment, but it does put extreme pressure on our systems here in Western Australia and indeed in other states,” he said. “I’m advised that other states are going through exactly the same experience.”
Mr McGowan has warned said he expects the number of infections in hotel quarantine to “grow significantly” after confirmation 78 of the 79 passengers on a flight to Perth on Saturday had been in India recently.

Four people on that flight have already tested positive and are in hotel quarantine.
“This case and the other four confirmed cases in hotel quarantine all originate from flight MH125 that arrived from Kuala Lumpur into Perth on Saturday, 24 April,” he said.
“Our expectation is the number of positive cases from this group of people will grow and potentially grow significantly.”

AMA WA President Dr Andrew Miller says we need to “get rid of these experts” giving the federal government “bad advice” about COVID-19 which leaves airborne spread of the virus “completely uncontrolled”.

“Our uncontrolled risk is all around airborne spread because of the nonsense that has come from the infection control experts group federally,” Dr Miller told Sky News.

“I’ve been calling since October last year – along with other people – for that group to be disbanded, because we think if you don’t deal with the airborne spread of this virus, you leave yourself at enormous vulnerability.”

While Australia has been successful in relation to borders, we can’t allow “any level of outbreak” within the community given airborne spread of COVID-19 is “completely uncontrolled”.

“We’re leaving ourselves vulnerable to losing this game in the final quarter by not controlling the airborne spread,” Dr Miller said.

His comments come as pressure mounts on the federal government amid calls from public health experts for new national guidelines on hotel quarantine.

Cricketers including David Warner are having to go to extreme lengths to move around COVID-19 ravaged India and a new travel ban means they’ll be stuck there for a while.
Australian cricketer Andrew Tye has told Sky News he no longer wanted to be in India as the stress of being stranded was “too much”. Mr Tye was among many Australian cricketers in India for the Indian Premier League, but has since managed to get on a commercial flight to Sydney where he is now quarantining. The federal government is expected to ban commercial flights from India amid an extended coronavirus crisis, and will also not be giving Australia cricketers any priority. Mr Tye said to his knowledge the federal government had no involvement with his flight out of India. “I spoke to my franchise and said I don’t really want to be here, the stress is too much, I want to get home before I get locked out,” he said. “They booked me on a flight a couple of days later”. Mr Tye said he and other IPL cricketers were kept “incredibly safe” by the league’s franchises. “They put us up in hotels, and it’s completely bio-secure; they make sure all the staff are tested,” he said. “We are in a pretty safe environment when it comes to being looked after as players over there.”

Some of David Warner’s Australian teammates have left the Indian Premier League as the country battles a horror new wave of COVID-19 but a travel ban could halt the exit of any more Australians.
Warner, who is captain of the Sunrisers Hyderabad, posted a photo of the extreme lengths he and his teammates have to go to in order to travel through India at the moment.
The opening batsman, who is on a contract in excess of $2.5 million in the IPL, had to wear head-to-toe protective clothing to avoid any chance of contracting coronavirus.
Australian white-ball stars Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson on Monday joined fellow bowler Andrew Tye in leaving the IPL to return home as the crisis in India worsens.
Reports in India have suggested Warner, Steve Smith and all Australians still in India could be flown home before borders shut, and the IPL postponed.
But on Tuesday flights to and from India into Australia were suspended until May 15 including eight repatriation flights that were planned to return from India next month
Batting star Chris Lynn called for Cricket Australia to facilitate a charter flight out of the country in the coming weeks, but several players were all thought to be willing to remain put.
Aussie superstar quick Pat Cummins has vowed to stay and donated $50,000 to help the nation fight the outbreak.
Cummins, playing on a deal in excess of $3 million, also called for other players to donate to the PM Cares Fund.
“India is a country I’ve come to love dearly over the years and the people here are some of the warmest and kindest I’ve ever met,’’ he said in a the statement.
“To know so many are suffering so greatly at this time saddens me greatly.’
“There has been quite a bit of discussion over here as to whether it is appropriate for the IPL to continue while COVID-19 infection rates remain high. I’m advised that the Indian government is of the view that playing the IPL while the population is in lockdown provides a few hours of joy and respite each day at an otherwise difficult time for the country.
“As players, we are privileged to have a platform that allows us to reach millions of people that we can use for good. With that in mind, I have made a contribution to the “PM Cares Fund”, specifically to purchase oxygen supplies for India’s hospitals.
pic.twitter.com/2TPkMmdWDE
“I encourage my fellow IPL players – and anyone around else the world who has been touched by India’s passion and generosity – to contribute. I will kick it off with $50,000.
“At times like this it is easy to feel helpless. I’ve certainly felt that of late. But I hope by making this public appeal we can all channel our emotions into action that will bring light into people’s lives.
There are still 14 Aussies including Warner and Cummins, as well as a handful of coaches like Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich still in India
Paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile told cricket.com.au he planned to stay with his Mumbai Indians franchise.
“Everyone‘s got their own opinions on it and different situations for them,” Coulter-Nile told cricket.com.au.
“I was surprised to see AJ go home, and then Zamps and Richo, but when you speak to them, you definitely understand where they‘re coming from.
“I spoke to Zamps a little while ago and he made a very compelling argument for going home. But for me, I feel like it‘s safer for me to stay in the bubble than try and get home at the moment.

Flights to and from India into Australia have now been suspended, amid increasing concerns over the nation’s escalating COVID-19 situation.
WA Premier Mark McGowan
Flights to and from India into Australia have now been suspended, Scott Morrison has announced, amid increasing concerns over the nation’s escalating COVID-19 situation.
“We recognise that this has been a very significant outbreak in India,” the Prime Minister told reporters, off the back of a national security committee meeting this morning.
“Today we agreed, in addition to the measures that I announced after the last National Cabinet meeting, to pause direct passenger flights between India and Australia until the 15th of May.”
Following the PM’s decision last week to reduce arrivals from India by 30 percent – with passengers travelling from there required to undergo a virus test 72 hours before leaving their last port of call – calls have mounted for him to close our border to the nation altogether.
On Sunday, India recorded 352,991 cases – the worst single-day increase in any country since the pandemic began – as mass cremation sites were established in response to a mounting death toll. Another 323,000 new infections were reported in the last 24 hours, and 2,771 deaths.

Filing a tax return can be a painful chore at the end of the financial year, but there’s always the chance of getting a slab of money back.
But what if you could throw out the tedious paperwork and still receive at least $400 to $1000, without the hassle of saving receipts?
That’s the proposal of a new Aussie think tank called Blueprint Institute, which has called for complex tax returns to be scrapped for around 80 per cent of taxpayers.

It suggested that the Australian Taxation Office offer standard work-related expenses worth $3000 to be claimed automatically, allowing people to submit a form that was already pre-filled. For the 20 per cent with high work-related expenses, they could have the option to fill out a full tax return.
Three quarters of Australians claim tax deductions, totalling $37 billion a year, with 70 per cent of people using an accountant to file their return.
The Bureau of Meteorology have forecast smoky conditions for the Illawarra and metropolitan Sydney again tomorrow.
The poor air quality is the result of planned hazard reduction burns, with NSW Health urging residents in a statement this morning to take precautious.
"Smoke particles irritate the eyes and airways. For most people, this causes temporary symptoms like cough and sore throat," NSW Health's Executive Director of Health Protection, Dr Richard Broome, said.

From the satellite you get an idea of the difference between current cloud & smoke. Generally, cloud showing as the thick heavy white areas, while the smoke is the lighter "wispy" plumes. On current forecasts many areas will see similar conditions to today https://t.co/69YtnzZ2FZ pic.twitter.com/SAN7MIA8qq
"Smoke from hazard reduction burns can be patchy and conditions often change rapidly. Over the coming days, the smoke is expected to be worse in the mornings, so people are advised to limit outdoor activity until it clears in the afternoon.
"It's also a good idea to keep an eye on the NSW air quality website for real-time information about air pollution levels and for advice on what action you should take."
An alleged drug dealer became unstuck during a police roadside stop when a woman interrupted and asked if she could buy cocaine from the driver.
Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command posted about the incident on Facebook.
Officers said plain-clothed detectives intercepted the 26-year-old man’s car along Gould Street, a one-way road in Bondi, after he was allegedly spotted using his mobile phone and driving the wrong way just before midnight on April 20.
“While speaking to the nervous driver who kept fidgeting with his phone, a woman also approached the vehicle and interrupted detectives’ conversation,” police said.
Police claim she told them she needed to speak to the driver because she wanted to buy cocaine.

Victoria may begin accepting travellers from the Perth and Peel regions from midnight, just days after the state slammed its border shut to parts of Western Australia.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley confirmed health authorities would contemplate whether to change the travel rules today despite four new cases reported in WA’s hotel quarantine scheme overnight.
Mr Foley told reporters he expected the Perth and Peel regions would change from red to orange zones on Tuesday night.
It would mean travellers would be able to enter the state but have to isolate until returning a negative test.

Channel 7 has been ordered to pay a former contestant on My Kitchen Rules more than $22,000 a year in ongoing compensation after she was left unable to work due to “psychological injury” she suffered from her time on the show.
Piper O’Neill, who appeared on the 2019 season of the reality cooking competition with her best friend and fellow beauty queen Veronica Cristovao, lodged a workers compensation claim against the broadcaster in August last year seeking payment of close $1000 in weekly benefits, starting from December 24, 2018.
Ms O’Neill, 38, was memorably revealed to be having a secret relationship with rival contestant Victor Aeberli in a much-hyped “sex scandal” storyline.

NRL star Jack de Belin told his cousin in a phone call intercepted by police he felt “sick” at learning a young woman had accused him of rape and the situation was “pretty f***ed”, a court has heard.
The St George Illawarra Dragons forward and his co-accused Callan Sinclair are standing trial at Downing Centre District Court accused of sexually assaulting the woman, then 19, after the trio met at Wollongong’s popular Mr Crown bar during a Christmas pub crawl in 2018.
Picture: Joel Carrett/NCA NewsWire
Their trial has heard allegations from the woman that she felt “dead inside” and was crying as the men swapped positions forcing vaginal, oral and anal sex on her at a North Wollongong unit.
Mr de Belin, 30, and Mr Sinclair, 23, have both pleaded not guilty to five counts of aggravated sexual assault and maintain the encounter with the woman in the early hours of December 9, 2018 was consensual.
Today, the jury was played a series of phone calls made by Mr de Belin and Mr Sinclair in the days after the incident, in which they express their disbelief at learning the woman had gone to police and say they will “tell the truth”.

Australia will bar citizens from flying to India for weddings and funerals in the wake of a “tsunami” of COVID-19 cases and fury over outbreaks in hotel quarantine facilities at home.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the tough new rules on outbound travel today as he confirmed a snap ban on incoming flights until May 15.
The decision reflects demands from the states for much tougher rules for outbound travel to COVID-19 hot spots. Travel will be restricted to essential travel only including national interest, medical exemption and COVID purposes.
Government sources confirmed the new rules will ban travel to India for weddings and funerals.
It follows revelations that a man who went to India for his own wedding before returning to Australia and sparking a COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia was able to prove “profound” reasons for travel, according to Health Minister Greg Hunt.
– Samantha Maiden
Mr Morrison is asked why arrivals from India can't just be sent to the Northern Territory's Howard Springs quarantine facility, which hasn't had any incursions and he describes as a "very successful facility".
"95 percent of the cases currently that arrived into that facility have originated in India. And so, working closely with the Northern Territory government, as well as our medical advisors up around that facility, their advice is we need to slow that pace significantly over the next few weeks to ensure that we can maintain the health of people in that facility," he said.
"This will give some breath space to the NSW arrangements and allow people from other countries to come back – you will see just as many coming through the NSW system.
"There will be less in Western Australia because they asked to halve their capacity, but there's increases on the way. So we'll see more Australians coming back."
The "pause" on arrivals from India is for "very sensible health reasons", reflecting Australia's performance during the pandemic thus far.
"We can speak to a performance that few countries can. We have always listened to the medical advice," he said.
"I think that's put Australia, I think, in a very strong position of so many nations when it comes to our handling of the pandemic. In Australia, we are living like few countries in the world can and do at the moment. I'm very determined that it remains that way."
The PM has deflected a question over whether West Australian Premier Mark McGowan was "right" to call a three-day snap lockdown for Perth and Peel last Friday.
"You will not find me squabbling about this, you will find me supporting the states and territories," Mr Morrison told reporters.
He also refused to accept criticism of our hotel quarantine system, after days of Mr McGowan telling reporters we should have more Commonwealth quarantine facilities instead of states using hotels.
The PM spoke of the 99.9 percent "success rate" of our quarantine systems, listing only two occasions where an infection spread seriously into the community, one of which was in Sydney's northern beaches over Christmas.
"I don't think there's a country in the world who would not want a quarantine system that has been working as effectively as that," he said.

Experts are stumped by the mystery spread of COVID-19 on a flight from India, as Australia considers banning flights from the virus-ravaged nation.
A new variant has emerged from the subcontinent, but is it driving the deadly second wave of COVID in India itself?
Dozens of passengers flying from Delhi to Hong Kong tested positive for COVID-19 after their flight. Picture: @tripperheadSource:Twitter
Experts are working to understand how dozens of passengers on a flight from Delhi tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival, despite them all testing negative before boarding.
At least 52 passengers returned positive tests after flight UK6395, operated by Indian airline Vistara, landed in Hong Kong on April 4.
They had all tested negative before the flight, as Hong Kong only allows entry to travellers who return a negative pre-flight test from a reputable lab with 72 hours of departure.
Six passengers had been denied boarding because the standard of their test result wasn’t up to scratch, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Despite the rigorous screening, eight positive cases were detected before passengers began Hong Kong’s three weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine, while the others were picked up during the quarantine period.

There were 146 adult passengers and seven children on the Vistara charter flight, which was organised by Hong Kong travel company Nanda Travel to return stranded travellers from India.
“We’re shocked by this,” the company’s director Poonam Nanda told the Journal.
“This one flight appears to be an astonishing outlier and we are all confounded by these numbers.”
Passenger Rashida Fathima, who was on the flight with her husband and two children, told the Journal she believed the caught the virus on the plane, despite wearing a face mask for most of the six-hour journey.
She said some passengers were coughing during the flight and many took off their masks to eat prepackaged meals, which was allowed.

Hand sanitiser and alcohol wipes were available on board.
Vistara said it ensured “strict compliance with all guidelines issued by the Indian as well as the destination countries’ authorities for all flights”.
Hong Kong has now suspended all flights from India until May 3 at least. Australian authorities are considering today a similar move as the spread of COVID-19 escalates in India.
With air travel considered by experts to be reasonably safe, health experts have cited a number of possible reasons for why 52 passengers came to test positive after the flight, including the transmission of a more virulent strain of the virus.

Experts say passengers could have become infected in India between returning a negative test and boarding the flight, and that results could have been false negatives.
They are also considering whether the passengers became infected in Hong Kong’s quarantine hotels, rather than on the plane.
Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding from the Federation of American Scientists pointed to recent cross-transmission in hotel quarantine in Australia to show quarantine transmission was possible.
“Some may have occurred after the initial 72 hour pre-departure time window after they got tested. India cases increased 60 per cent each week for the last two weeks. But this is why our border testing is leaky,” he tweeted.

“So, it could also be hotel transmission to some degree too,” he added. “Hotel room cross infections have been observed in Australia’s hotel quarantine system too.
“Regardless, the epidemic situation from India is too hot.”
Western Australian premier Mark McGowan has said COVID-19 tests conducted in India for people returning to Australia “aren’t accurate or aren’t believable” as the Federal Government considers a suspension of flights from the country.
The National Security Committee of cabinet, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, was due to meet on Tuesday to discuss the rapidly escalating situation in India.
Mr McGowan has backed an anticipated flight ban by the security committee, as he warned of a “significant” rise in cases after 78 of the 79 passengers on a flight to Perth on Saturday had been in India recently.
“It’s obviously a diabolic situation that is going on in India at the moment, but it does put extreme pressure on our systems here in Western Australia and indeed in other states,” he said.
“I’m advised that other states are going through exactly the same experience.
“We obviously have a problem with India,” he added. “Some of the tests conducted in India either aren’t accurate or aren’t believable and clearly that’s causing some issues here.”
On Monday, India recorded another day of record coronavirus figures, with 352,991 new infections and 2812 deaths.

The chief public health officer has revealed there are currently just 12 available rooms for COVID-positive patients
Returned Australian Bibhas Dutt told Sky News Australia is the only country which is “very hard” to get back to, even for citizens, during the pandemic. “Australia is the only country which is very hard to come back even for citizens. I was trying since, I think, June to come back,” he said. Mr Dutt finally managed to fly out of India - where he said the situation has become “very scary”- on April 15 and is finishing up his quarantine in Darwin’s Howard Springs facility. “This is the best centre I can suggest to anyone who is willing to come back also to Australia,” he said. “I have a room, I have a small balcony, I can speak to my neighbours with a mask on so it’s not very hard and the food and all the services are the best”. He said the government should invest in setting up similar quarantine facilities where returned travellers have access to fresh air and sunlight.

South Australia’s top public health official has revealed the state currently has just 12 COVID-19 rooms available for positive patients.
Speaking on ABC Radio on Tuesday morning, Nicola Spurrier’s comments came as the state recorded 14 new coronavirus infections on Monday; all returned travellers from overseas in medi hotels.
Professor Spurrier said that large number was not “unexpected” because there was a flight from Malaysia scheduled to land in SA on Saturday.
She said hotel workers at Tom’s Court, including nursing staff, worked on Friday to “reshuffle” guests to make additional room.
Professor Spurrier added there were “a few flights” scheduled to land in SA in recent days but they would be diverted to other states.
“I’m pleased to say we’ve been able to accommodate these additional cases,” she said.
“Obviously, if you keep on getting 14 cases a day you’re not going to be able to manage that, but we’ve been given a reprieve with flights.
“It gives us a chance for some people in Tom’s Court to be discharged and takes a little bit of pressure off us for that period of time.”

When asked the total number of active cases that could be safely managed with current resources, Professor Spurrier explained it was dependent on how sick people were and the family grouping.
She said there were 12 available rooms left in the state’s dedicated COVID-positive facility, what she described as “a reasonable amount of capacity”.
“We try and have the guests at either end of the hotel,” she said.
“That reduces the viral load that can concentrate the passageway but if we had to increase our capacity then we have to shift our guests around which is what we did on Friday.
“We don’t have people squished and about to burst at the seams.
“The nurses are comfortable with how things are going at the moment and we’re expecting some discharges over coming days as well.”
There are currently 32 active cases in the state, with two infected people residing in the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

Queensland has lifted its hotel quarantine restrictions from travellers from Western Australia and those in quarantine have been allowed to leave.

There were 236 people who had been in hotel quarantine in Queensland since WA’s lockdown for Perth and the Peel region was announced. 

The state government said travellers can exit quarantine if they meet criteria such as testing negative at least once and had not attend venues linked to the WA COVID-19 cases.

WA Health officials have added two new venues to a growing list of COVID-19 exposure sites in Perth, including a Westpac bank.
Premier Mark McGowan says Western Australia's three-day lockdown over the Anzac Day weekend will have cost the state tens of millions of dollars but has argued a widespread outbreak would have cost billions. The state has just moved out of a three-day snap lockdown imposed after one case of community transmission was identified by contact tracers. “The impact to the economy and we are analysing that,&quot; Mr McGowan said. &quot;The initial estimate was around $70 million. “The Treasury estimate of this obviously if we went into a long-term lockdown, a community spread, the cost would be many billions and tens of thousands of jobs. “That was the choice we faced.&quot;

A bank and a post office have been added to a growing list of COVID-19 exposure sites flagged by WA Health officials as Perth and Peel rebound from a snap three-day lockdown.
Perth and the Peel completed lockdowns overnight after a second straight day of no new community cases.
Interim restrictions remain in place until 12.01am on Saturday, including mandatory face masks and limits on gatherings.
However, WA Health has added the following venues, both in Applecross, to the casual contact list.
APPLECROSS: Post Office, Riseley Street, April 22, 2.30pm to 3pm; Westpac bank, Riseley Street, April 22, 2.15pm to 2.45pm
Anyone who has visited the two sites at the times mentioned need to attend a COVID clinic for testing and isolate at home until receiving a negative result.
“Continue to monitor for symptoms for 14 days following your visit,” a WA Health statement read.
“If you experience any symptoms at any time – fever, coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, loss of smell or taste – go to a COVID clinic to be retested.”

Health officials have also updated the exposure times to the following venues.
Several restaurants are considered high risk, with anyone who has visited at the times listed considered a close contact.
Those people are urged to get tested and complete 14 days of self-quarantine regardless of the test result.

It comes a day after WA Health alerted that a man who contracted coronavirus in Perth visited a Coles supermarket and other venues before flying to Melbourne.
The man left hotel quarantine on April 17 and stayed with a friend and her two children in Kardinya.
That friend had a rapid COVID test and returned a positive result on Friday, becoming the first case of community transmission in WA in more than 12 months.
The case visited several venues during his stay in WA before flying to Melbourne on Wednesday.
People who went to the below locations at the listed times have been urged to get tested and isolate at home until they receive a negative result.

NSW has recorded one new local coronavirus case after investigations revealed a returned traveller caught COVID-19 in a hotel.
A new variant has emerged from the subcontinent, but is it driving the deadly second wave of Covid in India itself?

NSW has logged one new locally acquired coronavirus infection after a returned traveller previously believed to have acquired the virus overseas was reclassified as a local case.
Health officials now believe the person was infected with the highly transmissible South African variant of coronavirus while staying in the Mercure Hotel in Sydney‘s CBD.
“An investigation into how COVID-19 transmission occurred between returned travellers who had been in quarantine at the Mercure Hotel has led NSW Health to reclassify one case, previously reported as overseas acquired, as locally acquired,” NSW Health wrote in a statement on Tuesday morning.

There were 12 new overseas-acquired cases in hotel quarantine in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday.
In the seven days before that, there was a total of 46 overseas acquired cases, with a spike on April 23, when 18 new ones were recorded.
There has been an increasing prevalence of mutant strains of coronavirus, labelled “variants of concern” by NSW authorities.
In the latest weekly COVID-19 report, the health department wrote that 41 per cent of overseas acquired cases were diagnosed with one of three variants of concern that originated in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively.
Between November 29 last year and last Thursday when the report was issued, 584 returned travellers had been diagnosed with coronavirus.
Of those, 123 people, or 23 per cent, had a variant of concern.
There were no other new locally acquired cases reported on Tuesday.

Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan has declared Australia has a “problem with India” and said COVID-19 tests conducted in India for returning Australians either “aren’t accurate or aren’t believable”.

It comes after four people in hotel quarantine in Perth have tested positive for coronavirus after spending time in India prior to boarding a flight from Kuala Lumpur.

Western Australia health authorities confirmed 78 out of 79 people on the flight had been in India, sparking concerns of further infections.

National Cabinet previously agreed Australians returning from India would need to be tested before leaving the sub-continent and would also need to spend three days in an alternative location while waiting the result before boarding a flight home.

Mr McGowan said he is unsure whether the designated plan is occurring, but it is clearly “not working as intended”.

“I don't know if it's even been implemented,” he said.

“We obviously have a problem with India. Some of the tests conducted in India either aren't accurate or aren't believable and clearly that's causing some issues here.”

Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid says Australia should send some of its stockpiles of unused medical equipment such as ventilators to India where they can "do some good”.

India recorded more than a million new COVID-19 cases in the past three days and overwhelmed hospitals are running out of oxygen and struggling to source basic medical supplies.

“We’ve got to act in our national interest, but I think we are unlikely to face the kind of scenario that’s going on there because of the decisions of our national government and our state government’s in protecting us,” Dr Khorshid said.

“So those stockpiles of equipment that were brought in thinking we were going to face what was going on in Italy at the time, they’re very unlikely to be needed.

“I think they should be sent where they can do some good because they’re certainly not doing any good sitting in warehouses”.

Alaska Airlines banned US Senator Lora Reinbold from its flights after she repeatedly refused to follow mask requirements at Juneau International Airport on Thursday, April 22, according to local media reports. Anchorage Daily News reported a Juneau Police Department officer arrived at the scene and no enforcement action was taken, citing a department spokesperson. Over the weekend, Reinbold drove more than 700 miles from her home in Eagle River to board a five-hour ferry ride to Juneau and arrived at the state Capitol on Monday in time for legislative duty, local media reported. “I am keenly aware of the monopoly in air transport to Juneau that needs [to be] reviewed!” Reinbold wrote in a Facebook caption on April 25.

A surrogate who agreed to look after a baby for four weeks, has now been forced to look after the child for a year.
Surrogate stuck raising baby for a year as adoptive parents can’t fly over from China to pick her up due to Covid.

A surrogate for a couple living in China has been forced to raise the baby for almost a year due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.
Emily Chrislip, 25, from Idaho, in the US, gave birth to the young girl on May 18, in the middle of the pandemic, The Sun reports.
She and husband Brandon, who have a son of their own, agreed to look after the baby for four weeks, but it has now been nearly 12 months.

“At first, we thought it would be a max four weeks, and then it kept getting longer and longer,” Ms Chrislip told People magazine.
“At this point, we’ve just accepted that we don’t know … but we wouldn’t have it any other way. She is so loved and right now, we are the constant in her life.”
Ms Chrislip made the decision to be a surrogate after the birth of her son Camden, who is now two years old.
She said that she couldn’t imagine not being able to have her own biological child, and had been lucky enough to have an easy pregnancy, so looked into the process.

The mother-of-one was chosen in September 2019 to be a surrogate for a couple in China, explaining that the initial plan was for her parents to be here for the birth.
“We were going to let them be in the delivery room to see her be born and then they would have had their own room at the hospital with her and my husband and I would have had our own room,” she said.
“At the time of birth, my job was supposed to be completed.”
However, two months before she gave birth, the coronavirus pandemic put everything on hold, and the biological parents were unable to travel to the US from China.

The baby’s parents asked the couple if they would care for their daughter, instead of her being left with a nanny agency.
Although it was a tough decision to make at first, they decided it was the right thing to do – but they had no idea it would last nearly a year.
Ms Chrislip said she tries to put “barriers up” knowing that they will one day have to give her away.
“We definitely love her and will always care for her, but we understand she is not ours,” she said. “We just treat her as our own because at this stage in life it is so important to have the proper attention and love.”

In exchange for being a surrogate, Ms Chrislip received between $US35,000 ($A44,000) and $US40,000 ($A51,000) in compensation – which they used to pay off student loans and buy a bigger home.
It is illegal in the UK to pay a surrogate, except for their reasonable expenses.
After the year they’ve had, Ms Chrislip admits she’s not sure if she could be a surrogate again, although would consider it for the same parents if they wanted more kids.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced Australia will close its international border to India amid the nation’s escalating COVID-19 situation.
The National Security Committee is expected to impose a ban on all commercial flights from India after an emergency meeting was convened this morning to address the nation's escalating COVID-19 crisis. There are currently up to 9,000 stranded Australians which are registered with DFAT in India and Sky News understands repatriation flights from the country will continue but remain limited. Chartered flights may continue to bring Australians from India to Darwin to spend two weeks in quarantine at the Howard’s Spring facility and Australian cricket players, coaches and staff are not expected to receive any special exemptions

All passenger flights from India have been grounded until mid-May after crunch national security talks, as the country grapples with the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak.
Cabinet’s powerful national security committee met on Tuesday morning, agreeing to expand restrictions imposed on travel to and from India last week.
The country recorded 352,991 cases in a single day – the worst increase in any country since the pandemic began – as mass cremations sites were established in response to the mounting death toll.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the situation on the subcontinent as “truly heartbreaking”, confirming direct flights between India and Australia would be suspended until May 15.
“We share so much in common as peoples, as democratic nations, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences and support to the nation of India and the people of India,” he said.
“They are dear friends of Australia. We will stand with them during this terrible crisis, and for all Australians who were caught up in this terrible set of events.”
Indirect flights via Doha, Dubai, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have also been paused by those countries.
A decision on whether to extend the suspension will be made prior to its expiration.
Nearly 20,000 Australians have returned from India since March last year when the pandemic began.

Mr Morrison said the “risk continues to grow” in India but rejected suggestions Australians were being abandoned.
“We don’t think the answer is to forsake those Australians in India and just shut them off as some others suggest. That’s not what my government is going to do,” he said.
“We will stand with the Indian community here, and our friends in India, as one of our closest and most strategic partners.”
The Prime Minister said the government would work to restart repatriation flights as soon as possible and it would focus on the most vulnerable.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne revealed 9000 Australians in India were registered with DFAT and consular support would continue.
She said the number looking to return to India had spiked since last week when flights were slashed by a third.
“I expect that to increase but we will stay in close contact with those Australians and provide the support that we are able to,” she said.
The Prime Minister confirmed Australia would also ship medical supplies as part of a beefed-up humanitarian effort to aid India.
The shipments will include one million surgical masks, 500 non-invasive ventilators, along with gloves and goggles.
“Australia has obviously had a very different experience and that places us in a unique position amongst many countries to lend our support the India at this time,” Mr Morrison said.
Mr Morrison also confirmed Australian cricketers in India to compete in the Indian Premier League would not be prioritised for return.
“They’ve travelled there privately … This wasn‘t part of an Australian tour, and they’re under their own resources, and they’ll be using those resources I’m sure to see them returned to Australia,” he said.
Earlier, Labor leader Anthony Albanese described the situation as “desperate” and called for Australia to assist India in “whatever way we can”.

“A breakout of this virus in one part of the world is a breakout everywhere. It does have an impact,” he told ABC radio.
But Mr Albanese said the outbreak reinforced its view the commonwealth needed to “get quarantine right” and suggested facilities be moved outside of high-density CBDs.
“The government continues to resist because their priority is not accepting political responsibility when breakouts occur,” he said.
Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said the party backed medical advice, saying Australia was most secure when the virus was brought under control across the whole region.
But she claimed the government had failed to implement a “safe” national quarantine framework.
“As a consequence of not having that system of safe national quarantine, more people are at risk here in Australia and elsewhere,” she said.
WA Premier Mark McGowan on Sunday confirmed arrivals to the state would be halved for at least a month, having plunged Perth into a three-day lockdown over the weekend.
Mr McGowan also called for the federal government to prevent Australians leaving the country, even for weddings or funerals.

But Nationals senator Matt Canavan lashed Mr McGowan as a “panic merchant” and said flights should continue as the quarantine system had “worked very well”.
“We’ve actually got to grow up here and learn to live with what is going to be a spread of coronavirus around the world for years to come,” he told Sky News on Tuesday.
“Eventually, we will open up to the world, (and) there will be more cases of coronavirus here. Hopefully, at that point, most people are vaccinated and the risks aren’t as great.
“But we’ve got to learn to live with this.”
Mr Hunt said Australia was in a position to send non-invasive ventilators to the subcontinent as India’s death toll spirals.
Mr Hunt said New Delhi had also requested oxygen supplies, with India “literally gasping for air”.
Senator Canavan said there was only a “very remote possibility” sending ventilators overseas would leave Australia short.
He described India as the “medicine factory of the world” and said New Delhi had exported supplies throughout the pandemic.
“There’s no imminent risk here,” Senator Canavan said.
“There is an obligation on us here to return that favour. We’re in a comfortable position, we should be helping countries that are worse impacted.”

Pictures of a mass cremation site in India have emerged, with doctors begging for help as the country is crushed by a new COVID-19 wave.
India’s second coronavirus wave is catastrophic. So many people have died that locals have started makeshift crematoria, and that is still not enough.

India has been forced to create a makeshift mass cremation site as the country’s latest wave of COVID-19 infections sees hospitals and crematoriums overflow.
On Monday, India recorded another day of record coronavirus figures, with 352,991 new infections and 2812 deaths.
The spike in deaths has seen crematoriums across the country unable to keep up with the continual stream of COVID-19 victims.
In order to keep up with demand, Ghazipur crematorium in New Delhi was forced to set up a makeshift crematorium site in the car park.

“There are so many bodies that we have added space for 20 more pyres at the Ghazipur crematorium. There is usually a waiting time of three to four hours,” a senior official from the East civic body told The Indian Express.
“On Friday, the GTB mortuary alone had 47 bodies due to this. But we have now managed to cremate them, and more on Saturday. A body takes five to six hours to burn.”
Doctors beg for help as hospitals struggle under infections
Hospitals are also being crushed under the new wave of infections, with limited supplies leaving doctors begging for help.
Over the past week, multiple Indian states have reported running out of medical oxygen, with patients dying as a result.
New Delhi medic, Dr Gautam Singh, posted a desperate video to social media on Sunday begging for critical medical supplies to keep his patients alive.
“Please send oxygen to us,” he said through a choked voice.
“My patients are dying.”

Trains carrying nearly 150 tonnes of liquid oxygen have been sent out to the worst-affected areas of the country.
Numbers may be much higher than those being reported
Many experts are predicting the current wave will not peak for at least three weeks and that the real death toll and case count are much higher than what is being reported.
There are fears infections could soon hit 500,000 per day, and the nation’s fatality rate means that there could be 5700 deaths per day at the peak.
Based on the current rates of infections and deaths, health researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predict there will be almost one million COVID deaths in India by August.
As the situation in India continues to deteriorate, the Australian government is reportedly considering locking down the borders with India.
It comes amid revelations the Perth lockdown was sparked by a man was allowed to travel to India to attend his own wedding.
Countries rally to help send supplies to India
Scott Morrison is set to consider further restricting flights from the country today, with the Prime Minister already announcing last week that flights from the country would be scaled back by 30 per cent.
The Australian government is also considering sending oxygen and ventilators to help with the crisis.
“India is literally gasping for oxygen,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday.
Multiple countries have pledged aid to India, with the US and Britain rushing ventilators and vaccine materials to the country.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country would do “all it can” to help India, with nine airline containers of medical supplies set to arrive in the country on Tuesday.
In the US, the White House said it was making vaccine-production material, therapeutics, tests, ventilators and protective equipment immediately available to India.
France, Germany and Canada have similarly also pledged support.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described the situation in Indian as “beyond heartbreaking”.
“WHO is doing everything we can, providing critical equipment and supplies,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.
He said the UN health agency was among other things sending “thousands of oxygen concentrators, prefabricated mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies”.
The WHO also said it had transferred more than 2600 of its experts from various programs, including polio and tuberculosis, to work with Indian health authorities to help respond to the pandemic.

The United States committed Monday to releasing up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, as India grapples with a catastrophic new surge in infections and severe medical shortages, with hospitals overwhelmed and crematoriums at capacity.&nbsp;
The South Asian giant of 1.3 billion people recorded 352,991 new infections and 2,812 deaths on Monday -- its highest levels since the pandemic began -- as its Hindu-nationalist government comes under fire for allowing mass gatherings such as religious festivals and political rallies in recent weeks.
"U.S. to release 60 million Astra Zeneca doses to other countries as they become available," tweeted Andy Slavitt, senior advisor to the White House on Covid response.
But President Joe Biden held a telephone call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, pledging his country's "steadfast support for the people of India who have been impacted by the recent surge in Covid-19 cases."
Others were also rushing to India's aid.
The UN health agency is also sending oxygen, mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies and has transferred more than 2,600 experts from various programmes, including polio and tuberculosis, to work with Indian health authorities.
Germany and Canada have similarly pledged support, while France said Monday it will send eight oxygen production units as well as oxygen containers and respirators to India.
The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 3.1 million people worldwide out of at least 147 million infected.
"To put it in perspective," he said, "there were almost as many cases globally last week as in the first five months of the pandemic."
"We're in a fragile situation," she said.
In Italy -- the first European country to be hit by the pandemic in early 2020 and still one of the worst affected -- bars, restaurants, cinemas and concert halls reopened on Monday.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government was looking at relaxing restrictions for people who are fully vaccinated.
In Britain, Scottish pubs were allowed to reopen for the first time this year, along with non-essential facilities such as gyms, swimming pools and nail bars.
Elsewhere, countries are tightening restrictions.
Japan's annual "Golden Week" holiday got under way with new restrictions in Tokyo and Osaka, where shopping malls were asked to close and residents urged to avoid non-essential travel.
The tourism-dependent islands have recorded fewer than 100 cases and just two deaths in a population of 930,000.
In Iran, the Middle East's worst-affected country, the death toll passed 70,000, according to health ministry figures, with a record 496 deaths in the past 24 hours.

Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan is urging the Morrison Government to ban travellers from India, claiming hotel quarantine cannot stop outbreaks.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian criticised her Western Australian counterpart saying the reduction of the state’s overseas arrival cap puts pressure on other states.

Some restrictions will remain for the next four days and Premier Mark McGowan has warned the state could be locked down again if more infections are uncovered.

A mask mandate, the four-square metre rule for businesses and restrictions on aged care visits will remain in place until Saturday. 

Mr McGowan said "this step-down approach will give us confidence to begin to get back to normal while we wait for further testing."

Two Aussie blokes have turned their new spin on a culinary classic into a booming business which has already raked in $300k. Here’s how they did it.
Thousands of Australian companies are tipped to collapse into administration within the next three months - and some industries are particularly at risk.

When borders snapped shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Aussies Eddie Stewart and Min Chai were trapped in Sydney and unable to return to the cafe they had set up selling lamingtons in Tokyo.
With quite the hospitality pedigree — Mr Stewart is the former chef at cult institution Black Star Pastry in Sydney and Mr Chai is from N2 Extreme Gelato — the duo, who are both 36, decided to set up a shop called Tokyo Lamington in the Australian city.
They partnered with chocolate brand Koko Black for one day and their entire stock was sold out in 40 minutes.
While they have a traditional flavoured lamington, they like to experiment with different flavours and incorporate Aussie favourites like fairy bread.
It’s been a surprising hit with almost 40,000 lamingtons sold since September last year and revenue of around $300,000.

Mr Stewart said he loved lamingtons as a kid but didn’t have the best memories of them tasting great. He uses a butter-style cake for the base and raspberry jam and cream for their traditional lamington.
But that’s where tradition stops. There’s a yuzu flavour, which is a Japanese citrus fruit, as well as a black sesame cream.
“Our most popular would be neapolitan, which is like the ice cream,” he told news.com.au. “I think it’s that memory that people have when you were a kid. You’ve got the connection to a lamington and I think every adult that grew up in Australia remembers neapolitan and fighting over which colour you would have. It sounds a bit weird, but once get it and eat it, everyone turns around and says it’s just like the ice cream.”
He said they originally used fresh strawberries in the neapolitan lamington but it made it taste more like yoghurt, so they switched to a syrup to ensure it was “bang on”.
There’s a fairy bread flavour with buttered popcorn in the centre, which is dipped in hundreds and thousands, and is hugely popular with children, revealed Mr Stewart.
“We are just getting into vegan as well. It’s taken a bit of time to get right with the recipe testing, but we are happy with red velvet lamington we have created,” he said. “The next one to come out is a vegan carrot cake lamington. We make our own vegan cream cheese as well. We are very proud. These are not just your standard stale lamingtons, but we’ve gone a step further and made lamingtons cool again.”

All the flavours cost $7 with a rotation of six on offer each week, except for the yuzu which sells for $9 because it takes double the time to make, he said.
“People love it when we do quirky flavours. It sparks people’s interest as they try and imagine what it’s going to taste like. The red velvet sparked a lot more interest than we thought especially the fact its vegan,” he said. “When we started doing the whole vegan thing, we started looking for a vegan cream cheese and we couldn’t find anything we liked and we started making vegan cream cheese and had a lot of bad attempts. It took about a month to get right, but we are really happy with that. It’s a beautiful product and we want to bottle it and sell the cream cheese itself.”
Tokyo Lamington was just one of many new business started last year as the pandemic hit the country.
Australia’s entrepreneurial spirit continues to shine bright despite one of the toughest years the nation has faced, with 47,000 new businesses being added to the local economy last year, according to a new research report by global small business platform, Xero.
The industries that flourished for new business included the construction industry, professional and financial services, as well as healthcare.

Everyone has turned into an armchair epidemiologist during the pandemic. But Dr Karl says some vaccine misinformation is hard to correct.

Dr Karl Kruszelnicki said pandemic misinformation has spread because it travels faster and is easier to grasp than the truth.Source:Supplied
Scores of Australians have fallen for a “whole bunch of lies” around the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.
That’s the opinion of renowned science author Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, who has revealed the COVID myths that do the rounds on social media that he finds most frustrating to rebut.
The Triple J host told news.com.au that misinformation about everything from the pandemic to climate change was spread chiefly because misunderstanding and lies were simple to grasp.
In contrast, the truth is complex, sometimes imperfect, and takes longer to explain.
Dr Kruszelnicki will appear at the Sydney Writers’ Festival on Friday in a science-themed panel session entitled The Rise of the Armchair Epidemiologist.
Since the pandemic began, epidemiology has gone from being discussed mainly on university campuses to being debated between people, as the name of the session suggests, sitting on armchairs at home.
But Dr Kruszelnicki, who has just published his 47th book called the Little Book of Climate Change Science, said too many of those discussions were being fuelled by rumour and misinformation.
“Fake news travels so much faster thanks to the internet. You can end up just following a series of lies, over and over and over again and going down the rabbit hole,” he said.

Conspiracy theories and misinformation is easy to spread
Conspiracy theories swirling around 5G towers and Bill Gates were the barmiest claims some uninformed armchair epidemiologists came out with, said Dr Kruszelnicki.
But there were other claims he said he’d heard time and time again that continually exasperated him.
One of those was chatter that vaccines weren’t effective. Dr Kruszelnicki said some people had pointed to the Auckland Airport worker who recently contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated with the Pfizer jab as proof.
But this was no more than cherry picking one event to back up a dubious claim.
“No, not all vaccines are perfect, and their effectiveness depends on the person but to explain that you have to explain the concept of seroconversion and the complexity of the human body,” he said.
In a small number of cases, vaccines can take longer to work on some people or they might need more shots, Dr Kruszelnicki said. He had to have four jabs of the hepatitis B vaccine, he said, before he stated producing antibodies.
But that didn’t mean it wasn’t a crucial jab that was highly effective.

Truth takes longer to explain than lies
The complexity of the truth was also an issue. And in unfolding situations like a pandemic, advice on the best way to handle health can change.
“We run up against this factor which is called the ‘bulls**t asymmetry factor’ or ‘BAF’,” he said.
“It’s the realisation that it can take 10 times longer to debunk something.
“So I could say ‘climate change isn’t real, the climate has always been changing and besides all it will mean is you have to wear one less jumper in winter’.
“They took me seven seconds to say that. But to debunk it I’d have to talk about the Milankovitch cycle and the orbit of the sun and that takes 15 minutes which is an ABF of 260.
“So it’s really easy to spew out a whole bunch of lies. And then when you’re dealing with something that’s really complicated like a vaccine you end up with people getting confused when they hear these lies.”
Another issue was fear, which meant we often pay more heed to outlandish information.
“If something is weird and novel it really gets your attention because people worry that what you don’t know could kill you,” he explained.
The pandemic has been fertile ground for misinformation because it’s new, unsettling and advice in some areas has changed over time. Picture: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/AFPSource:AFP
Dr Karl’s most frustrating vaccine myth
There was another inoculation misunderstanding that Dr Kruszelnicki said had got far too much traction.
“It’s the straight out, anti-vax claim which is that vaccines weaken your immune system,” he said.
Again, the problem was the lie is simple, but the truth is imperfect and takes more time to delve into.
“You don’t know where to start. Many people don’t know that your immune system can be different to the person next to you.
“But if you look at the cold equations you’re so much better off being vaccinated.”
Indeed, data coming out of nations with high rates of vaccinations, such as Israel and the UK, has shown huge drops in both cases and hospitalisations in those people that have contracted the virus.
Dr Kruszelnicki said there were an “infinity of lies, but only one truth” that meant untruths could spread more quickly than they could be debunked.
Yet to combat misinformation, the best weapon was the truth, he said.
“Tell the truth but if the truth changes, then be quick to open up to that as well.”
Dr Karl Kruszelnicki will appear alongside UNSW infectious diseases expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and University of Sydney science communicator Associate Professor Alice Motion on Friday 30 April at the Sydney Writers Festival at the panel discussionScience Class: The Rise of the Armchair Epidemiologist.

Police in Delhi said they gave escorts to emergency deliveries of oxygen cylinders to city hospitals on the night of April 25-26. Police "prepared green corridors and made other arrangements for the safe and quick movement of oxygen tankers to several hospitals such as Dharamshila Hospital in Vasundhara Enclave, Safdarjung Hospital, Batra Hospital and St Stephen’s Hospital,” said Chinmoy Biswal, a police spokesman, told the Hindustan Times.

Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein has defended his government’s record on COVID-19 and the ongoing economic rebuild, while Opposition Leader Rebecca White blasted the state’s health system at the People’s Forum hosted by Sky News and The Mercury.
 
Sky News and the Mercury hosted the People's Forum with the Tasmanian Premier and Opposition Leader taking questions from Tasmanian voters five days out from the state election.

In her opening statements, Ms White said under the current Liberal government the health waiting list in Tasmania has blown out to the “worst it’s ever been” with 50,000 Tasmanians waiting to see a specialist.

The opposition leader said a Labor government would “reinvest into the services that Tasmanians need” and invest in TAFE courses, making them free for people in areas with workforce shortages.

Premier Gutwein spruiked the state’s record on COVID-19 to make Tasmania a “place on the planet that is safer than anywhere else in the world” and highlighted the state’s fast economic growth.

Critics have sounded alarm bells for the public as India’s brutal second wave of COVID-19 whittles away “whatever remains of democracy”.
India's second coronavirus wave is catastrophic. So many people have died that locals have started makeshift crematoria, and that is still not enough.

India has been brought to its knees after five straight days of setting global infection records, surpassing 350,000 new cases of coronavirus in a single day on Monday.
The brutal second wave has left politicians in a state of disarray as Prime Minister Narendra Modi attempts to steady his country’s reaction to the crisis.
“India is literally gasping for oxygen,” Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt said Monday afternoon, detailing the federal government discussions over shipping excess ventilators to aid the nation’s overrun healthcare system, which is dealing with more than 2,800 deaths per day.
Fronting the media on Sunday, Modi admitted the explosive resurgence of COVID-19 was a result of India becoming too complacent after stamping out the first wave in 2020. He urged the public to get vaccinated, advising they only get updates from “authentic sources” and not bite at any “rumours”.

“I urge people not to fall prey to any rumour about vaccines. You must be aware the government of India has sent free vaccines to the State governments,” Modi stated.
“The free vaccination program of the government of India will continue. I urge the State governments to utilise this scheme and ensure that maximum people have been vaccinated.”
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks over the restriction of public freedoms following the outbreak. Reports reveal the current administration is censoring political speech online to stem potential anti-lockdown sentiment.
The New York Times revealed that more than 100 posts from civilians criticising the government’s handling of the latest outbreak have been removed from the internet. Authorities reportedly pressured social media companies, with Twitter falling in line and deleting dozens of dissident posts on request.
Employees in India face harsh punishments including jail time for ignoring government requests to suppress political debate on their platforms.
The recent sweep came two months after the country announced new social media laws, forcing companies to hand over the name of the original sender of any message deemed “mischievous” and threatening to the sovereignty of India.

Nikhil Pahwa, editor of Indian tech publication Medianama, criticised the new reforms, saying they granted the government “disproportional” power over the public under the guise of national security.
“These are laws that are meant to control speech and give the government disproportional power over citizens,” Pahwa said via the ABC. “I strongly hope these rules will be challenged in the Supreme Court.”
The Bharatiya Janata Party already has a concerning history of squashing dissent, notably seen in the government’s violent reaction to recent “anti-farmer” legislation protests in late 2020. Unions claim the new laws are “gradually leading to the deterioration and ultimately end” of India’s established agricultural industry, organising an estimated 250 million workers to go on strike on November 26.
The government ordered police in various states to attack protesters using water cannons, batons, and tear gas to prevent the farmer unions from entering the nation’s capital. More than 250 protestors have been reported dead as a result of the government pushback.

Last year, NDTV’s Hindi news channel was cut off mid-broadcast following an order from India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Out of nowhere, Modi’s government blocked the channel from airing content for two days over its coverage of mob attacks on Muslims in New Delhi. The order claimed the station was “too critical toward Delhi Police and R.S.S.”
“It was shocking the central government took such a decision,” R. Subhash, editor at Media One, said in regards to the station’s blackout. “It was an attack on the freedom of the press.”
Professor of history at Princeton University Gyan Prakash said the recent crackdown on free speech was “damaging to whatever remains of democracy in India”.
Freedom House, a Washington DC based company that tracks countries’ internet freedom, says India is slipping down the rankings with a “partly free” score of 51/100 . In comparison, Australia has a 76/100 rating, with China (10), Iran (15) and Syria (17) sitting at the bottom of the list.

Even in Australia, the possibility of facing real-world consequences for posting controversial opinions on the pandemic isn’t out of the question. In Victoria, citizens have been subject to police checks and even arrests for their activity on Facebook. Footage of a pregnant Ballarat woman being handcuffed in her own home went viral last year as Victoria battled through its strongest lockdown period.
Victorians who opposed the stringent legislation began planning protests online, but were quickly shut down once authorities caught whiff of their activity. Cops argued the woman, 28, was inciting others to break the law and congregate despite the government’s outdoor restrictions.
“The search warrant entitles us — and we’re required to — seize any computers, any mobile devices you have,” Detective Adrian Smith said. “It’s in relation to a Facebook post, in relation to a lockdown protest you put on just that day.”
The woman responded that she “wasn’t breaking any laws by doing that”, informing the officer she had an ultrasound later that morning.
“You are actually. You are breaking the law,” Det Smith responded. “That’s why I’m arresting you.”
The livestream video has since collected over 10 million views and made its way around the world media, including websites in the UK and USA.
The original post read:
“As some of you may have seen the government has gone to extreme measures and are using scare tactics through the media to prevent the Melbourne protest.
“Here in Ballarat we can be a voice for those in stage four lockdowns. We can be seen and heard and hopefully make a difference!”

Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says the National Security Committee of Cabinet will meet to discuss ways Australia can assist India as it deals with a horrific COVID-19 situation.

“One of the options on the table will also be to bar arrivals from India through hotel quarantine into Australia. We saw Scott Morrison reduce the number of entrants from India last week,” Mr Clennell said.

“The PM said last week that the number of people coming from India testing positive to the coronavirus had risen form 10 per cent to 40 per cent.”

A raft of interim rules will come into place when the Perth and Peel lockdown lifts tonight. These are all the restrictions in place until Saturday.
Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid has told Sky News Western Australia's recent COVID-19 oubtreak and snap lockdown was 'preventable' after a report found the quarantine hotel at the centre was unsuitable for use. The Perth and Peel regions in WA were sent into a three-day snap lockdown after a returning Australian who travelled to India for a wedding tested positive after his 14-day quarantine and after spending five days in the community. Dr Khorshid said it was a 'very similar event' to the one which occurred in February in Perth as it related to an 'airborne transmission' of the virus between rooms in the hotel. He said the hotel in question was found by the government's own report, which was released in April, to be 'not suitable for hotel quarantine' due to its ventilation problems. 'It is frustratingly slow; that is the main criticism of the WA government here that they have not done everything they could have done to make hotel quarantine as safe as possible,' he said.

Perth and the Peel region will come out of lockdown as planned tonight, but some COVID-19 restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the week, including the use of masks.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt beat West Australian Premier Mark McGowan to the announcement that there were no new cases of local transmission overnight.
“Australia has recorded zero community cases in the last 24 hours,” Mr Hunt told reporters on Monday.
Mr McGowan fronted the media almost an hour later to announce the Perth and Peel regions would come out of the snap three-day lockdown as planned at midnight.
“The short three-day lockdown has done the job it was designed to do. It was a circuit breaker we needed to limit community spread and keep our community healthy,” he told reporters on Monday.
“At midnight tonight, the lockdown will end as planned. Interim restrictions will come into force from midnight tonight, allowing us to take a stepped-down approach after the three-day lockdown.
“We need to be cautious as we come out of lockdown as the virus could still be out there.
“This step down approach will give us confidence to begin to get back to normal while we wait for further testing and the incubation period of the virus to come to an end.”

Interim restrictions will be in place until midnight on Friday, with the Premier to announce the next steps forward that day.
From tomorrow, people in the Perth and Peel regions will be free to leave their homes, but masks will remain mandatory.
Masks are not required for primary school children, for vigorous outdoor exercise and for people who are exempt.
“For the next four days, people can return to work unless they can work from home or they are in a vulnerable category,” Mr McGowan said.
Schools will resume and staff are permitted to remove their masks while teaching.
Tafes can also open but universities are only open for online learning.
People can travel outside of the Perth and Peel regions, but they must wear a mask.
“If you currently are in another region, and have been in Perth and Peel since April 17, you will need to continue to wear a mask from tomorrow onwards,” Mr McGowan said.

There will be a 20-person limit in all homes, and at private indoor and outdoor gatherings.
Hospitality and entertainment venues, as well as retail outlets, can reopen, except for the casino, nightclubs and indoor fitness venues.
The 4 sqm capacity rule will be in place, with a limit of 20 patrons, not including staff.
Seated service will only be allowed for the next four days at hospitality venues, like pubs and restaurants.
“I know this makes it tough for many businesses,” Mr McGowan said.
“But it’s important we remain cautious and ease off restrictions in line with health advice so we can get back to normal as soon as possible.”
Weddings and funerals can apply for an exemption to have 100 people, as they have done during the lockdown.
Community sport and training can proceed with players and officials, but no spectators.
Visitors to hospitals, as well as aged care and disability aged care facilities, are restricted to compassionate grounds only.
Health Minister Roger Cook further announced there would be some changes to elective surgery.
“The focus will be on category one and urgent category two elective surgeries for the next four days,” he said.
“Non-urgent category two’s and all category three’s will be rescheduled.”
All non-urgent outpatients and community health visits will also be conducted via Telehealth if possible or rescheduled.
Mr Cook said impacted patients would be contacted.

The lockdown was sparked by a Victorian man who was released from hotel quarantine then unwittingly spread the virus to his friend in Kardinya.
It was later discovered a fellow restaurant diner also contracted the virus from the man.
The Victorian man caught the virus from another man quarantining in an opposite room at the Mercure Hotel.
That man had been to India to attend his own wedding and he also passed on the virus to his wife, as well as a pregnant woman and her daughter who were staying in another opposite room.
Mr McGowan last week said the Mercure Hotel would no longer be used to quarantine returned travellers because it was not the most suitable facility.
Since Friday, there have been almost 30,000 tests conducted in Western Australia.
Of the 354 close contacts, 222 have returned a negative test result so far, with other results pending.
From the close contacts, 50 people were linked to the Kitchen Inn restaurant in Kardinya and all 50 had returned negative test results.
Mr McGowan said there were 748 casual contacts and 329 had returned a negative result so far.
On Sunday, 259 people, including children, were tested at a Lansdale childcare centre that was exposed to the virus and so far 212 people had returned a negative result.
Chief health officer Andy Robertson said if the last time the infected man was in the community was April 23, then the state could get cases for up to 14 days after that.
“We will have to take that into consideration when we are making a decision about what the next steps are and whether there will be any continuing restrictions,” he said.

Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid told Sky News the snap lockdown was “preventable” given a report had found the Mercure Hotel was a weak link in the quarantine system.
Dr Khorshid said it was a “very similar event” to the one that occurred in February in Perth as it related to a likely “airborne transmission” of the virus between rooms in the hotel.
He said the hotel was found by the government’s own report, which was available in early April, to be “not suitable for hotel quarantine” due to ventilation problems.
“It’s unfortunately a little like Groundhog Day,” he said on Monday.
“It is frustratingly slow and, I think, really that is the main criticism of the WA government here — that they have not done everything that they could have done to make hotel quarantine as safe as possible.”
Dr Robertson said the report he saw on April 8 said all of the quarantine hotels could continue to be used “with mitigations”.
“That’s what the report actually says. It doesn’t say that they couldn’t be used,” he said.

Dr Khorshid said more could be done to improve the quarantine system across Australia.
“We’re going to be needing quarantine for many months and potentially years into the future — who knows when the next pandemic is coming?” he said.
“It does make sense to be now investing in Commonwealth run and funded quarantine facilities in each state and territory so that we’re not relying on these hotels that were really never built for this purpose for too much longer.”
But Dr Khorshid said Mr McGowan’s repeated calls to use current Commonwealth facilities was not very realistic.
“There’s major downsides to all of the potential Commonwealth facilities that are available,” Dr Khorshid said.
“What we need to do is create new ones.”

Days after millions of Perth residents were forced into lockdown, just one new case has been found, so are snap shutdowns worth the pain?

Short lockdowns to address COVID-19 outbreaks may not be worth the economic pain they inflict, with just one new locally acquired case identified in Western Australia since a three-day shutdown was introduced.
About two million residents in the Perth and Peel regions have been in lockdown since Friday, with the decision to introduce restrictions ahead of the Anzac Day long weekend meaning businesses lost up to $25 million in revenue, according to Restaurant and Catering Australia chief executive officer Wes Lambert.
Mr Lambert told ABC the timing meant businesses had to donate or throw away $7 million in produce and stock.
“Because it was Friday afternoon … they would’ve already been prepping for the weekend, they would’ve been making their stocks and soups and they would’ve already been grazing things,” Mr Lambert said.
It’s the second lockdown residents have endured this year, with a five-day lockdown of Perth and Peel in January lifted without any further cases being detected after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive.
WA Premier Mark McGowan confirmed the lockdown would be lifted on Monday night and told reporters the lockdown had “delivered the results that we needed”.
“The short three day lockdown has done the job it was designed to do. It was a circuit breaker we needed to limit community spread and keep our community healthy,” he said.
However, infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collignon told news.com.au he was not convinced short lockdowns had made much difference in controlling cases in WA or other states.
He said there had been several short lockdowns related to hotel quarantine breaches, including two in Perth, one in Adelaide, one in Melbourne and two in Auckland, New Zealand.
“As far as I can see, there have been no COVID cases found that were not close contacts of a known case, or someone who had been to a (exposure site) venue, and these contacts would normally already be asked to quarantine” he said.

Prof Collignon acknowledged there were circumstances where a wider lockdown was necessary, for example, if there were a number of cases in the community for which there was no known source, but this hadn’t been the case so far.
“If Perth had had five or six cases where we didn’t know where they came from, (a lockdown may be necessary) but it didn’t have that,” Prof Collignon said.
Short lockdowns have been touted as a “circuit-breaker” to limit the contact people have with each other, which helps stop the spread of the virus, and give authorities time to get on top of the situation.
Prof Collignon said the contact tracers seemed to be the only ones helped by lockdowns, as it gave them more time to do their job: contacting everyone who may have been exposed to the disease and asking them to isolate before they could spread the virus.
“I don’t see that (short) lockdowns are making any difference to finding cases but there is a huge social and economic cost,” he said.
Prof Collignon said the WA lockdown had seen two million forced to stay home compared to just tens of thousands in NSW during an outbreak beginning in December last year.
In NSW only those in Sydney’s northern beaches were told to isolate as the state did not introduce a snap lockdown of the entire city.
Its approach focused on contact tracing and asked only those who had been in close contact with positive cases, or who had visited certain venues, to isolate.
“I think short lockdowns are very disruptive for almost no extra benefit in controlling the infection,” Prof Collignon said.
However, even the NSW approach has significant economic consequences, with KPMG modelling estimating the outbreak cost the state’s economy $3.2 billion in lost working hours in December.

Western Australia’s most recent lockdown was introduced after a man aged in his 50s was infected with COVID-19 while in hotel quarantine, although he was not diagnosed for many days after leaving.
He visited several locations in Perth over five days and gave the virus to a female friend who he stayed with, as well as someone who went to the same restaurant.
The man later tested positive after arriving in Melbourne on April 21.
The case has also raised questions about hotel quarantine practices, although WA Premier Mark McGowan has focused debate on whether the Commonwealth should take more responsibility for quarantining returned travellers.
“We’ve been shouldering, and the States have been shouldering, all the load in hotels that were never built for this purpose now for 14 months,” Mr McGowan said on Sunday.
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has hit back at his comments saying Mr McGowan agreed to the existing quarantine system last March, The West Australian reported.
She said the Federal Government’s detention facilities and Australian Defence Force bases were not fit for quarantine and that Mr McGowan was “very much aware of that”.
Ms Andrews also noted that NSW was “doing extremely well with a significant number of returned travellers coming through” and that “maybe it’s time to make the call to Gladys Berejiklian to see what can be learnt by other Premiers and first Ministers”.

The identity of a lone man walking in an Anzac Day march during Perth’s lockdown has been revealed.
Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid has told Sky News Western Australia's recent COVID-19 oubtreak and snap lockdown was 'preventable' after a report found the quarantine hotel at the centre was unsuitable for use. The Perth and Peel regions in WA were sent into a three-day snap lockdown after a returning Australian who travelled to India for a wedding tested positive after his 14-day quarantine and after spending five days in the community. Dr Khorshid said it was a 'very similar event' to the one which occurred in February in Perth as it related to an 'airborne transmission' of the virus between rooms in the hotel. He said the hotel in question was found by the government's own report, which was released in April, to be 'not suitable for hotel quarantine' due to its ventilation problems. 'It is frustratingly slow; that is the main criticism of the WA government here that they have not done everything they could have done to make hotel quarantine as safe as possible,' he said.

A man filmed walking alone in an Anzac Day march in Perth is a former One Nation staffer who was protesting COVID-19 restrictions.
Michael Darby was filmed and photographed marching along St Georges Terrace in Perth’s CBD on Sunday in the middle of a lockdown that forced Anzac Day services to be scrapped.
He carried a sign on his body that read: “Honour the fallen.”
Mr Darby, who previously worked for One Nation MP Robin Scott and has attended protests against the COVID-19 vaccine, said he was marching to protest the lockdown restrictions.
“Somebody had to do it,” he told 6PR radio on Monday.
There are very many veterans … whose only social contact every year is Anzac Day and in some cases Remembrance Day as well.
“Those chaps and ladies too are bleeding because for two years in succession they haven’t had their Anzac Day.”
Mr Darby said the RSL, rather than the state government, should have decided whether the march should proceed during the lockdown.
“Somebody had to make the point that it is not the function of government to tell the RSL how, or where, or when they should be commemorating Anzac Day,” he said.
“The government should have stayed out of it, and left it to the RSL to seek their own medical advice.”

Mr Darby confirmed he was not a veteran, but said he was wearing medals he had earned, including a national service medal.
“Better men than I served in Vietnam, I was only there as a civilian,” he said.
“But I was an army officer and I’m proud to have known very many veterans.”
Mr Darby told NCA NewsWire he served in the army for eight years from 1966 to 1974.
He said he was in Vietnam as a civilian in April 1975.

Outspoken MP Craig Kelly has hit back at Facebook after his profile was removed for spreading COVID-19 misinformation.
Craig Kelly's social media content reaches beyond his electorate with his numbers challenging the Prime Minister in audience size.

Controversial MP Craig Kelly has hit back at Facebook after his profile was removed by the social media giant for his “repeated” spreading of misinformation about COVID-19.
Taking to Twitter, the member for Hughes accused the social media platform of attacking freedom of political speech.
“It‘s wrong to censor the free speech of elected officials as it threatens our democracy,” his post read.
“It's NOT misinformation to have a difference of opinion.
“The idea that the faceless people of Facebook are purveyors of all truth is OUTRAGEOUS!”
FACEBOOK ATTACKS FREEDOM OF POLITICAL SPEECHIt's wrong to censor the free speech of elected officials as it threatens our democracyIt's NOT misinformation to have a difference of opinionThe idea that the faceless people of Facebook are purveyors of all truth is OUTRAGEOUS !
Many people replied to the post defending Facebook’s stance.
“Just because it‘s your opinion and you want it to be true, doesn’t mean it is. Again lol,” one person wrote.
“I’m hoping beyond hope they ban you from Twitter too,” another said.
In a statement, a Facebook spokesman said the platform didn’t allow “anyone, including elected officials”, to share misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to imminent physical harm, or COVID-19 vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts.
“We have clear policies against this type of content and have removed Mr Kelly’s Facebook page for repeated violations of this policy,” the spokesman said.
Facebook had previously pulled several of Mr Kelly’s posts for breaching the company’s Misinformation and Harm policy.
Mr Kelly quit the Liberal Party to join the crossbench in February, after heavy criticism for his commentary about COVID-19, as well as for his handling of serious allegations made against one of his staffers.

Health Minister Greg Hunt has attempted to explain why a traveller was able to enter Australia from India amid a spike in COVID-19 deaths.
India's second coronavirus wave is catastrophic. So many people have died that locals have started makeshift crematoria, and that is still not enough.

A man who went to India for his own wedding before returning to Australia and sparking a COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia was able to prove “profound” reasons for travel, according to Health Minister Greg Hunt.
Perth was plunged into a three-day lockdown on Friday after community transmission was linked to a man who returned from India, which is in the middle of a destructive spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The man arrived in Perth from India on April 10 with his new bride. He tested positive at the Mercure Hotel three days later.
The virus then spread to his wife and seeped into other rooms across the corridor, infecting three people including a child.
One of those people – a Victorian man – then unwittingly spread the virus to two other people in the community.

International travel has effectively been banned, with numerous reports of thousands of trapped Australians still unable to return home.
The man returning from India for the purpose of a wedding has infuriated many and sparked confusion about the federal government’s policy on international travel.
When asked about his opinion on Australians being allowed to move in and out of the country, Mr Hunt said these exemptions were “for the most profound humanitarian or compassionate reasons”.
“There are exemptions, only exemptions for people to leave the country under the strictest of circumstances,” Mr Hunt told reporters on Monday.
“Some of those leaving to live overseas, some on critical national business or related business.
“But all of them are done on an exemption basis by the ABF (Australian Border Force) and done on the basis that we know that we need to bring Australian’s home.”
When asked more specifically about whether Australians should be allowed to leave the country to attend weddings and sporting events, he said each case was “considered on its merits”.
“The Australian Border Force operates an exemptions process and that has seen the most extreme reduction in outbound and inbound travel as a consequence,” Mr Hunt said.

“They consider each case on its merits, and I will leave the individual cases to them.
“But essentially, you have the categories of critical work and in assisting the national interest and compassionate exemption.”
Mr Hunt said authorities had adopted varying responses to exemptions with regards to high-risk countries, including North America and Europe, over the duration of the pandemic.
“We now have a crisis in India and we have already taken the steps to further tighten the departures, and so Border Force is managing that on a case-by-case basis,” he said.
“But if more is required then more will be done.”
The update comes after West Australian Premier Mark McGowan renewed his calls for the commonwealth to take responsibility for the hotel quarantine system and use their own facilities instead of hotels.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has made a similar pitch.
Federal opposition health spokesperson Mark Butler echoed this demand and implored the Morrison government do more to keep Australians safe.
“We need dedicated facilities built outside our CBDs, purpose built for quarantine,” he said on Monday.
“We know hotels are built for tourism. They're not built for medical quarantine, and Scott Morrison has done nothing on those recommendations.
“Our quarantine system is in a mess and Scott Morrison has to stop pretending it's not his job to fix it.”
WA Premier Mark McGowan has continued to criticise the commonwealth over the quarantine system. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Tony McDonoughSource:News Corp Australia
Mr McGowan told reporters on Monday that people should only be allowed to go overseas for the “most extreme and extraordinary of reasons”.
“We can’t have people leaving this country for whatever purpose and then coming back COVID-positive, one, displacing other Australians overseas, but two, putting pressure on our system,” he said.
“So there’s a range of things that could be done, but I think the most important is we need to have a system that has fewer people coming into hotel quarantine and we have to have fewer people leaving Australia and returning.”
Mr McGowan repeated his urging of the commonwealth to stop letting people leave the country to go to weddings and other non-essential events.
“I’ve had multiple occasions of this reported to me – people have been going overseas to play in sporting events, they have been leaving here to go and study, they have been going to funerals and they have been going to weddings,” he said.
“They’re not essential. You can study here, you can get married, people here are missing funerals.
“We need to stop this sort of international travel for these sorts of purposes.”

A St John Ambulance paramedic has been forced into self-quarantine after possibly being exposed to COVID-19 while transporting a patient in Perth.
The incident happened last Friday during a hospital transfer from hotel quarantine, St John Ambulance has confirmed.
All ambulances can safely transfer coronavirus-affected patients, but two vehicles have specialised isolation, meaning they are fitted with additional infection control measures.
A St John Ambulance spokeswoman said there had been an issue relating to air flow, which had since been repaired.

“Both (SIA) vehicles have been inspected and are fully operational,” she said in a statement on Monday.
“As a precautionary measure, one paramedic who had worked in the SIA vehicle is in home quarantine. That person is fully vaccinated.”
The Perth and Peel regions in Western Australia are on the final day of a three-day lockdown, sparked by a Victorian man who was released from hotel quarantine and unwittingly spread the virus to a friend and a fellow restaurant diner.
Premier Mark McGowan will hold a press conference later on Monday to announce whether the lockdown will be extended.

It’s changed the way we live, but shock research from a top US university now suggests there is no real benefit to social distancing.
Queenslanders Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announces rules to be lifted earlier than expected.

New research has cast doubt on the “six-foot rule” that has informed social distancing guidelines used around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professors Martin Z. Bazant and John W.M. Bush have challenged the long-held guideline adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation.
They claim the risk of being exposed to the virus indoors is the same at 60 feet as six feet – even while wearing a mask.
The six-foot rule, the researchers argue, is largely based on an outdated belief that the biggest risk is so-called “large drop transmission” directly from the mouth of an infected person, whereas there is now “overwhelming evidence” that airborne transmission through microdroplets held aloft on air currents actually plays the dominant role in the spread of COVID-19.
That means the six-foot rule offers little protection from virus-bearing aerosol droplets that are sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space.

Instead of social distancing-based venue capacity limits depending on the size of a room, they propose new indoor safety guidelines that would put a limit on the “cumulative exposure time”.
“We argue there really isn’t much of a benefit to the six-foot rule, especially when people are wearing masks,” Prof Bazant told CNBC.
“It really has no physical basis because the air a person is breathing while wearing a mask tends to rise and comes down elsewhere in the room so you’re more exposed to the average background than you are to a person at a distance.”
In Australia, the Federal Health Department’s “COVIDSafe” guidelines are based on physical distancing of 1.5 metres (five feet) in public and there are indoor density requirements of four square metres per person.

RELATED: Three more blood clot cases linked to vaccine
The MIT paper, published in the journal PNAS last week, outlines a new method for calculating COVID-19 exposure risk in indoor settings which takes into account factors including rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, infectiousness of variants, face mask use and activities that affect “breathing rate” and “respiratory activity” such as eating, speaking, singing or exercising.
Citing the example of a typical school classroom, they note that “extended periods of physical activity, collective speech, or singing would lower the time limit by an order of magnitude”.
Speaking to CNBC, Prof Bazant said the WHO and CDC had overlooked the important variable of the amount of time spent indoors, and that the existing guidelines for enforcing occupancy caps were flawed.
He said six-feet social distancing rules that had closed schools and businesses were “just not reasonable”.
“What our analysis continues to show is that many spaces that have been shut down in fact don’t need to be,” he said.
“Often times the space is large enough, the ventilation is good enough, the amount of time people spend together is such that those spaces can be safely operated even at full capacity and the scientific support for reduced capacity in those spaces is really not very good. I think if you run the numbers, even right now for many types of spaces you’d find that there is not a need for occupancy restrictions.”
He added: “This emphasis on distancing has been really misplaced from the very beginning.
“The CDC or WHO have never really provided justification for it, they’ve just said this is what you must do and the only justification I’m aware of, is based on studies of coughs and sneezes, where they look at the largest particles that might sediment onto the floor and even then it’s very approximate, you can certainly have longer or shorter range, large droplets.”

Social distancing, he argued, wasn’t “helping you that much and it’s also giving you a false sense of security because you’re as safe at six feet as you are at 60 feet if you’re indoors”, noting “everyone in that space is at roughly the same risk, actually”.
He also claimed that social distancing makes virtually no sense outdoors and doing so with masks on was “kind of crazy”.
“If you look at the air flow outside, the infected air would be swept away and very unlikely to cause transmission,” he said.
“There are very few recorded instances of outdoor transmission. Crowded spaces outdoor could be an issue, but if people are keeping a reasonable distance of like three feet outside, I feel pretty comfortable with that even without masks frankly.”
It comes as pressure grows on the CDC and other health bodies to ditch the six-foot guideline, particularly in the context of schools, many of which remain closed in the US as they do not have the space to keep students six feet apart.

“It never struck me that six feet was particularly sensical in the context of mitigation,” Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told The New York Times last month. “I wish the CDC would just come out and say this is not a major issue.”
The newspaper noted that the origin of the recommendation was “something of a mystery”.
“It’s almost like it was pulled out of thin air,” said Linsey Marr, an expert on viral transmission at Virginia Tech University.
America’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci last month hinted that authorities were considering revising the six-foot rule to three feet, in response to new research that found no statistically significant difference in infection rates in school districts using the different limits.
“What the CDC wants to do is accumulate data, and when data shows ability to be three feet, they will act accordingly,” Dr Fauci told CNN, adding, “I don’t want to get ahead of official guidelines.”

US tourists vaccinated against Covid-19 will be able to visit the European Union in the coming months, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview on Sunday with The New York Times.
Signaling a major change in EU policy as vaccinations step up worldwide, von der Leyen gave no timetable, but the Times said that the new rules could be in place by this summer.
"Because one thing is clear: All 27 member states will accept, unconditionally, all those who are vaccinated with vaccines that are approved by EMA."
The Times said the US's rapid vaccination program, and progress in talks over how to use vaccine certificates, were behind the plan to allow the return of leisure travel from the US to EU.
Resumption of travel would depend "on the epidemiological situation, but the situation is improving in the United States, as it is, hopefully, also improving in the European Union," she added.
Greece said last week that travelers from the EU and five other countries who are vaccinated or have a recent negative Covid test will no longer have to quarantine on arrival.
The European Union has said it wants to launch a vaccine passport for travellers, though plans have not yet been formalized.

Several Australian cricketers have withdrawn from India’s glamorous T20 tournament as the country’s COVID-19 crisis escalates.

Australian cricketers Andrew Tye, Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa have abandoned the Indian Premier League and returned home as the country’s COVID-19 crisis continues to escalate.
COVID patients are dying on the pavement outside hospitals as India buckles under a devastating “tsunami” of the virus — with experts warning the nation could see one million virus-related deaths by August.

According to Health Ministry data, India has registered more than one million infections over the past four days, taking the country’s total number of cases beyond 17 million.
News.com.au confirmed Australia is considering even tougher restrictions on flights from India in the next 24 hours amid revelations the Perth lockdown was sparked by a man’s overseas holiday to attend his own wedding.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison will convene a meeting of the national security committee of cabinet on Tuesday to consider a further reduction in flights.
Several Australian cricketers — including Steve Smith, David Warner, Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell — are currently competing in the Indian Premier League, not scheduled to fly home for several weeks.
The Rajasthan Royals released a statement on Twitter on Sunday evening, revealing Tye had returned to Australia “due to personal reasons”.
AJ Tye flew back to Australia earlier today due to personal reasons. We will continue to offer any support he may need.#RoyalsFamily
Speaking to SEN Breakfast with Gilly & Goss on Monday morning, the 34-year-old said the decision was made because he feared being locked out of Australia, also citing bubble fatigue.
“I just thought to try and get on the front foot and get home before I get locked out of the country. It’s been a long time in a hub – I was doing the calculations earlier and I think I’ve had 11 days at home out of bubbles and hubs since August,” Tye said.
“There’s definitely concerns, a lot of guys have been in touch. Some other guys are very interested in what route I took home and how I approached it. Other guys are happy to know I’m OK and make sure I’m in a good space.
“There is some concern and I’m not sure if I’ll be the only one, but that’s too early for me to say.
“You can look at it from different points of view … an Indian point of view is; how are these companies and franchises spending so much money on the game and able to spend so much money on the IPL when there’s people not being able to be accepted into hospital?”
Later on Monday, the Royal Challengers Bangalore revealed Zampa and Richardson were also returning to Australia for “personal reasons”.

No surprises that more players are prioritising family over the #IPL and returning home. Kane Richardson became a father in November and Adam Zampa missed #RCB’s opening game to get married, having postponed his wedding last year #IPL2021
Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association released a joint statement on Monday afternoon: “CA and the ACA remain in regular contact with Australian players, coaches and commentators taking part in the Indian Premier League, which is being conducted under strict biosecurity protocols.
“We will continue to listen to feedback from those on the ground in India and the advice of the Australian Government.
“Our thoughts are with the people of India at this difficult time.”
The IPL’s players and staff are confined in strict hotel biosecurity bubbles, flying between cities on chartered jets.
Delhi & Districts Cricket Association president Rohan Jaitley told ESPNcricinfo this week: “The bubble is absolutely intact … if I am not part of the bubble, I can’t meet anybody (inside it). It is absolutely safe.”
Despite the setbacks, the BCCI has opted not to postpone or abandon any matches. The financial losses would be monumental.
The Age’s Daniel Cherny reported that several Australian cricketers were seeking to leave the glamorous T20 tournament early, fearing they will be locked out of the country.
According to the report, the cricket stars are having difficulty finding a connecting flight.
It appears that Andrew Tye will be just the first of a number of Australians seeking to leave the IPL early, the biggest issue for them being whether the Aus Govt may tighten travel restrictions from India to the point where they aren't allowed to return home
“Everyone’s sort of a bit nervous about whether they can get back into Australia. I dare say there’ll be a few other Australians a bit nervous about getting back into Australia,” former Victorian batsman David Hussey told the publication from India.
“It’s on the news every minute of the day. You see people in hospital beds. It puts a lot of things in perspective. We actually discussed after the game last night, how lucky we are to play the game and try to entertain people around the world.
“Everyone’s pretty nervous about what’s going on over here, but they’re also pragmatic.
“From a Kolkata point of view, we’re desperate for the tournament to keep going, purely because everyone’s in lockdown, there’s not much else to do.”
Meanwhile, Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin announced he would also be leaving the Indian Premier League to be with his family.
I would be taking a break from this years IPL from tomorrow. My family and extended family are putting up a fight against #COVID19 and I want to support them during these tough times. I expect to return to play if things go in the right direction. Thank you @DelhiCapitals 🙏🙏
Earlier this month, Australian all-rounder Daniel Sams tested positive to COVID-19 while serving hotel quarantine, along with Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate Devdutt Padikkal.
Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting spoke openly about the “grim” situation on Saturday: “This IPL, probably more than any other, has become more about what’s happening outside than what’s happening here.
“We right now are probably the safest people in the country being in the bubbles that we are in. Continually I’m asking the boys at breakfast every day how’s everything going on the outside.
“It is really important, we are thinking about the extended family, not just us, but we’ve got to be talking about what’s happening outside because it is quite grim.”

Last week, the United Kingdom added India to a “red list” of countries from which most travel is banned, over fears of a new COVID variant.
According to the BBC, England’s IPL stars will be allowed to return home but must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.
The decision could prove a logistic nightmare for English and Kiwi Test cricketers taking part in the T20 tournament.
The IPL Final is scheduled for Sunday, May 30, while the first Test between England and New Zealand commences in London three days later on Wednesday, June 3.
Cricket broadcaster Raunak Kapoor says the silence from the IPL about the situation unfolding outside of their bio-secure bubbles is deafening.
“If they tweet on the situation, they acknowledge the crisis. If they acknowledge the crisis, they acknowledge the government’s failure. If they acknowledge the government’s failure, they think they’ll get into trouble,” Kapoor tweeted.
“The problem is not the IPL. It’s just the lack of acknowledgment.
“I don’t blame the IPL. If anything the tournament got lucky with everything being in place before things got alarmingly worse. And cancelling it does nothing. Just acknowledge & empathise with the people. They’re people. Not just a target audience.
“Sport is a platform. One that reaches people. If the people are suffering, or in pain, reach out to them. Show them you care. Show the people of India that the sport & its icons care about them. Of course you can do more, but this is the very least.”
Honestly, the IPL is what's keeping me sane right now. Another death today (4th in 10 days) among people I knew. I'd have lost it if not for the IPL.

Military expenditure worldwide rose to nearly $2 trillion in 2020, defying the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers said Monday.
Global military spending increased by 2.6 percent to $1,981 billion (about 1,650 billion euros) in 2020, when global GDP shrank 4.4 percent, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
"Because of the pandemic, one would think military spending would decrease," he said.
He cautioned however that due to the nature of military spending, it could take time for countries "to adapt to the shock".
The overall share rose from 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent, the largest year-on-year increase since the financial crisis of 2009.
- Some Covid effects -
Nations such as Chile and South Korea openly decided to reappropriate military funds in response to the pandemic.
Another response, as in Hungary for example, was to increase military spending "as part of a stimulus package in response to the pandemic".
The world's two biggest spenders by far were the US and China, with Washington accounting for 39 percent of overall expenditure and Beijing for 13 percent.
The US also increased its spending for the third year in a row in 2020, after seven years of reductions.
Lopes da Silva however noted that the new "Biden administration has not given any indications that it will reduce military spending."

The United States on Sunday led international pledges of support for India as the country grappled with worsening Covid-19 crisis with record daily death rates and severe medical shortages.
The Indian healthcare system has struggled to cope with a huge surge in cases, leaving patients' families begging for help on social media and the capital New Delhi forced to extend its strict lockdown.
Covid-19 has now killed more than three million people worldwide since emerging in China in December 2019.
Delhi on Sunday reported more than one-quarter of those tested were positive.
Western nations including Britain, France and Germany have also pledged help.
"The United States has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine," a White House statement said, referring to the India-produced version of the AstraZeneca shot.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the country had been shaken by a "storm" as he called on people to get vaccinated and not "get swayed by any rumour about the vaccines".
Arch-foe Pakistan offered support and assistance as Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted prayers for a "speedy recovery".
Neighbouring Bangladesh, which shares a 4,000-kilometre (2,500-mile) border with India, will halt land crossings for two weeks, Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen told AFP.
"He was gasping for air, we removed his face mask and he was crying and saying 'save me, please save me'," Mohan Sharma, 17, said of his father, who died outside a Delhi hospital.
A weeklong lockdown in the megacity of 20 million, set to last until Monday, was extended by one week.
The European Union is pooling resources to ensure a rapid response. "Alarmed by the epidemiological situation in India. We are ready to support," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said.
In Iraq, the blaze at eastern Baghdad's Ibn al-Khatib hospital began when improperly stored oxygen cylinders blew up, medics said.
The health ministry said 82 people were killed and 110 wounded, while the Iraqi Human Rights Commission said 28 of the victims were patients who had to be taken off ventilators to escape the flames.
Elbaz was known for his playful designs that transformed the storied French house Lanvin before his ouster in 2015.
A limited glimpse of pre-pandemic life will however be on display in the US on Sunday with a Oscars ceremony reuniting some Hollywood's A-listers for the first time in more than a year.
A limited number of spectators could also be allowed to attend the Monaco Grand Prix on May 23, Formula One chief executive officer Stefano Domenicali said Sunday.

A Subway, chemist and green grocer are among new COVID-19 exposure sites in Perth, as the city braces for a decision on lockdown.
The Western Australian outbreak has recorded no new community cases but Premier Mark McGowan has warned restrictions could continue for some time. Residents in Perth and the Peel region are waiting to see whether they will be freed from lockdown at midnight tonight after a very different Anzac Day in the state.

As millions of Perth and Peel residents await a decision on whether the snap lockdown will end on Tuesday, Western Australia Health has added a Subway, grocer and chemist to their extensive contact tracing list.
WA Orchard Fruit and Veg shop in Perth was visited by a COVID-positive case on April 19 between 5.25pm – 6.25pm.
Health authorities said further information had been provided and more CCTV footage analysed, resulting in them also adding Bentley Subway, visited on April 22 between 11.45am -12.30pm; and Chemist Warehouse Joondalup, visited on April 22 between 8pm – 9pm.

Affected customers have been ordered to get tested and quarantine for 14 days regardless of the test result from the time of potential exposure.
WA Health has also amended the exposure times at a number of restaurants, based on further advice from COVID-positive cases.
Anyone who visited Kung Fu Kitchen in Morley between 6pm – 8pm on April 21, Fortune Five Dim Sim in Northbridge between 8pm – 9.30pm on April 18, and Thai Thymes Joondalup between 6.30pm-8pm on April 22 must also get tested and self-quarantine for 14 days from exposure time.
Two Bentley locations visited on April 20 – Jumbo BBQ Roast Duck House (between 12pm-12.30pm) and Woolworths Bentley Plaza (between 11.15am-12.15pm)– have been removed.
The update comes hours before WA Premier Mark McGowan is set to announce whether the state will be released from its snap lockdown from Friday.
On Sunday, Mr McGowan pleaded for anyone who had visited the exposure sites to be tested.
“Please, keep doing the right thing,” he said.
“We all work together, it gives us the best chance to come out of lockdown and safely get back to normal.”
The Premier refused to confirm on Sunday afternoon if he would end the lockdown on time as planned, saying it was “too early to predict” what would happen and suggesting some measures would stay in place.

At least 82 people have been killed and 110 injured after a catastrophic fire broke out in a Baghdad hospital.

The Iraqi Prime Minister has fired key officials over the incident blaming it on negligence by authorities.

Initial reports suggest the blaze began after an oxygen cylinder exploded in one of the wards.

Firefighters battled flames into the early hours of the morning and at least 28 patients on ventilators battling severe symptoms of COVID-19 are among the dead.

India has extended Delhi's coronavirus lockdown after the country broke global infection records four consecutive days in a row.  

The United Kingdom, the United States and France are stepping in and sending much needed medical supplies to the region.

However, the crucial donations will only make a marginal difference to a country which has seen over two million cases in the past week.

Mark McGowan has won a battle with the federal government, lost another and lashed a traveller who brought COVID-19 back from India.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan has warned if the Commonwealth does not provide quarantine assistance then the state then may not return to taking its full quota of returning Australians. Mr McGowan has requested Commonwealth assistance with hotel quarantine over the last week, specifically asking the Morrison government to provide ADF support and to reduce the amount of international flights coming into Perth. “My request to the Commonwealth government to reduce the international arrival cap is vital,” he said. “If we are to crush the virus, just as we have done before, we need to slow the flow of returning travellers”. The premier confirmed his request for the Commonwealth government to halve the state’s international arrivals for a month was accepted and will begin on Thursday with 512 arriving per week, which will stay in play until May 30. “If the Commonwealth is unable to assist with proper quarantine facilities, I am reluctant to return to the full 1,025 per week cap,” Mr McGowan said. “That weekly number of returning residents is not something that can continue long-term without proper Commonwealth quarantine facilities being used.”

The West Australian Premier’s demand the federal government use its own facilities for COVID-19 quarantine has been harshly dismissed, but it has agreed to slash the number of Australians returning to Perth.
Mark McGowan has previously taken aim at the Commonwealth over the issue, saying it had abrogated its responsibility to take care of quarantine, leaving the states to bear the burden, including the cost.
He reiterated his views on Saturday and again on Sunday in the midst of a three-day snap lockdown, sparked by a person who went to India for a wedding then passed it onto a Victorian man while they were quarantining at the Mercure Hotel in the Perth CBD.
Confirmation of the Victorian man’s case came after he had flown home to Melbourne.
He had spent five days out in the Perth community, during which time he infected a friend with whom he went to a restaurant, where another man contracted the virus.
There were no new locally-acquired cases confirmed on Sunday, but a man in his 50s tested positive in hotel quarantine after returning from India.
Mr McGowan said he was at the “end of his tether” at the lack of federal government help with quarantine, reiterating his previously expressed view there were various Commonwealth facilities that would be more suitable.

But in a statement on Sunday, a federal government spokesman shot down Mr McGowan’s demands, saying venues such as the Christmas Island detention centre and defence bases were simply unsuitable for quarantine.
“Defence bases are operational facilities and the risk to critical defence personnel is not acceptable,” he said.
“Defence bases also generally feature austere accommodation facilities with shared dorms and bathrooms making them unsuitable for quarantine purposes.
“In many cases, these facilities are not close to health and intensive care services.”
He also said Australia’s immigration network was at capacity, with individuals in detention including many the nation was seeking to deport back to their home countries after they committed serious crimes including sexual assault.
“Not only are the facilities at capacity, but it would inappropriate and logistically difficult for Australians to have to live alongside such individuals,” the spokesman said.

Defence Minister Peter Dutton dismissed Mr McGowan’s call on ABC Insiders on Sunday.
“There are eight or nine hotels that are working perfectly fine in WA at the moment,” Mr Dutton said.
He also said the Premier had “made a mistake with the Mercure Hotel” and “doesn’t want to be the next Dan Andrews”.
After those comments, Mr McGowan was asked by a reporter: “Why do you keep pushing ... when you know they won’t give in?”
“We keep pushing it because it is actually their responsibility and they do have facilities built for this purpose,” the Premier replied.
“I’ve lived in some of those defence facilities.
“I know what they’re like. Many of them were built with this in mind.
“When everyone pushes back against Christmas Island, just remember ... the Commonwealth used it in March and April last year for people coming back from Japan and China.
“So all I’d say is, look, it should be a joint effort here.”

Mr McGowan said the federal government wanted “to push it to the state and blame the state if anything goes wrong”.
He also revealed the Commonwealth had agreed to his call to halve the number of returning Australians into Perth, reducing the intake to just over 500 per week from Thursday.
Mr McGowan said he refused to return to current levels.
“We’ll advise the Commonwealth that we will not go back up to over 1000 per week because our system is put at too much risk when that occurs,” the Premier said.
“Especially when we learn that many of the people who are COVID positive are people who left Australia recently and went to COVID-laden countries.
“I’m just not copping that.”

Mr McGowan was scathing of the person who went to India for a wedding.
“It’s not OK,” he said.
“If you want to go overseas, it should be for only the most extraordinary of reasons at this point in time.
“Not to go overseas for a wedding. Even to go overseas for a funeral.
“We have to be a lot tougher in relation to letting people out of Australia at this point in time.”
The Mercure Hotel will no longer be used as a quarantine facility for returned travellers because of its poor ventilation but will instead accommodate low-risk seasonal workers from Tonga and Vanuatu.
The cluster is the state’s first case of community transmission in more than a year, not including a hotel quarantine security guard who contracted the virus in January, prompting a five-day lockdown.

More than 80 people died Sunday when a fire ripped through a Baghdad hospital for Covid-19 patients, sparking outrage and the suspension of top officials overseeing Iraq's crumbling health services.&nbsp;
According to Iraq's fire service, "the hospital had no fire protection system and false ceilings allowed the flames to spread to highly flammable products."

Collingwood’s finals hopes have been all but extinguished by Darcy Parish and his Bombers in front of a world record COVID-19 crowd of 78,113 fans in the traditional Anzac Day blockbuster at the MCG on Sunday.
The Magpies have slumped to 1-5, their worst start to a year since 2005, and for out-of-contract coach Nathan Buckley, the result could serve as the first nail in the coffin of his 10-year tenure as Collingwood boss.
The Bombers overcame a blistering three-goal Collingwood burst in the first five minutes to assume control of the contest for most of the day. But their own goalkicking issues (it was 9.10 to 10.2 at one stage) threatened to derail their hopes of a win, and allowed Collingwood to get their noses in front by a point early in the final quarter.
However, rather than allow that Brody Mihocek goal to deflate their spirits after playing so well, Essendon composed themselves and fixed their radar to pile on the next four goals to put the result beyond doubt and run out 24-point winners.
The fourth of those was kicked by Parish who continued his career-best form with a personal best 42 disposals (17 contested), three games after registering a career-high against St Kilda, along with nine clearances, six marks, seven inside 50s, 619 metres gained, two goal assists, nine score involvements, and two goals to win the Anzac Day medal. No Essendon player has ever registered more possessions against Collingwood.
It was the Bombers’ 10th victory on the most significant day of the home-and-away season since their annual fixture with the Magpies began in 1995. Collingwood still comfortably lead the ledger 15-10-1.
BOMBERS ABSORB EARLY PIES PRESSURE
Collingwood threatened to put the Bombers out of their misery in quick fashion as they jumped out to a 17-point lead early on. But Essendon quickly stopped the bleeding, thanks largely to the efforts of Parish, and proceeded to dominate the territory battle (17-9 inside 50s) in the opening term. Poor ball use from the Magpies, particularly in defence, and Essendon’s increased pressure also helped the Bombers boot four of the next five goals to take a three-point lead at quarter-time.

MCDONALD-TIPUNGWUTI MAGIC
Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti brought out all the tricks for the big occasion, and his second, third and fourth goals in particular were simply outstanding. Five minutes into the second quarter, he gathered his own crumbs and sold some candy to Scott Pendlebury before snapping truly from 25m out. Fifteen minutes later, he pounced on the loose ball along the boundary and managed to keep it in play before executing another snap shot from a very tough angle in the pocket. TV replays showed the ball might have gone out of bounds, but weren’t conclusive. And late in the third quarter, he took on Pendlebury again and won as he charged through the congestion at a stoppage in Essendon’s goal square and, as he was being tackled by the Collingwood skipper, slapped it on his boot while falling to ground to float it home.
THE WRIGHT STUFF
Peter Wright played his best game for Essendon on the biggest home-and-away stage of all. When his team really need him, Wright not only outmarked Brodie Grundy and converted a set shot from 40m out on a sharp angle late in the third term to give his side a 12-point lead, but he converted another set shot from an even tighter angle early in the final term to give the Dons a 16-point lead. He also had 16 touches (nine contested), 10 marks (four contested), six tackles, six score involvements, 11 hitouts, two goals and a goal assist.
COSTLY CAMERON MISS
Darcy Cameron was one of Collingwood’s best players but he had the chance to cut the deficit to two points late in the third quarter after marking strongly 20m out directly in front of goal. Instead, the former Swan sprayed the sitter to the right.

The nation’s COVID-19 vaccination rollout has been given an enormous boost with a chief scientist receiving his first locally made jab.
CSL’s chief scientist has received his first dose of a locally made AstraZeneca vaccine in a strong show of confidence for the COVID-19 jab.
CSL chief scientific officer Dr Andrew Nash received his first dose from Dr Tony Bartone, the past president of the Australian Medical Association Victorian branch, on Friday morning ahead of the ramping up of the phase 2a rollout.
From Monday, Australians aged 50 years and older will be able to receive the AstraZeneca jab at a participating general practice as the federal government picks up the pace to try to get the adult population vaccinated by Christmas.
While Dr Nash did not answer questions on Friday regarding the vaccine’s blood clotting issues, he said the company was pleased to play its part in protecting Australians.
“All of the vaccines are very effective. We manufacture the AZ vaccine, which is just one of a number that are available,” he said.
“They all play a very important role in protecting the community, so we’re happy.”
Dr Nash said he felt great after his dose was administered and the procedure was pretty painless.
“It’s been a remarkable performance by our staff to really get to this stage where, from scratch, we’ve been able to manufacture and distribute vaccines for AstraZeneca and the government to vaccinate the number of people that we have,” he said.
At least 5.5 million doses of the locally made AstraZeneca vaccine will have been released to the government by the end of this week, with 1 million now being produced each week.
CSL hopes showing Dr Nash, and its COVID-19 vaccines program director, Dr Bev Menner, receiving their jab will act as a resounding endorsement of the safety and efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
It comes as the nation’s Therapeutic Goods Administration on Thursday revealed seven new blood clot cases after people were received the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The TGA maintains the reporting rates of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in Australia were “consistent with what is being seen internationally”.
The TGA defines TTS as “a very rare event” involving “serious blood clots” with a low blood platelet count – less cells that fight against clots.
About 1.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered so far in Australia.
Dr Bartone said anyone with concerns about their COVID-19 vaccination should speak with their GP.
“In my practice, in many GP practices across the country, the apprehension, the concerns, maybe even fears, are suitably addressed in a one-to-one fashion, and the vast majority of those people then proceed and go ahead with the vaccination,” he said.
“Where you’re dealing with a mass vaccination set-up, and it’s a walk-up … that’s where we’ve got to increase the amount of communication, information and material available to them, to ensure they can make an appropriate decision.”
Dr Bartone said all medications had side effects.
“The extremely rare side effects have had an enormous amount of publicity and that has jolted the confidence of some Australians, but my message to everybody is, this is an effective, safe way to ensure COVID-19 becomes no more than a common cold,” he said.
Dr Bartone said supply had been the limiting factor in the government’s vaccination rollout so far, but come Monday he expects it to “significantly rise” next week and beyond, with the announcement of up to 400,000 extra doses being supplied to GPs each week.

One billion dollars worth of shiba inu coin, a dogecoin spin-off, has been donated to India’s COVID-19 relief fund, as the country’s situation worsens.
The world’s youngest known crypto billionaire has donated more than $1 billion in cryptocurrency to India’s COVID-19 recovery.
Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, open-sourced blockchain that facilitates ether cryptocurrency, transferred 50 trillion shiba inu coins, a dogecoin spin-off, and 500 ETH on Wednesday to the India Covid-Crypto Relief Fund.
At the time, the shiba inu coins were worth around $1.2 billion $1.14 billion ($A1.5b).
This isn’t the first time the 27-year-old Russian-Canadian programmer has donated to India’s COVID-19 recovery.
In April he transferred about $600,000 ($A776,000) in ether and maker (MKR) coins to the relief fund.
Creator of the fund Sandeep Nailwal immediately took to Twitter to thank Mr Buterin for his donation and assure investors that the funds would be use responsibly.
“We will not do anything which hurts any community specially the retail community involved with SHIB,” he wrote.
Thanks @VitalikButerinOne thing we have learnt from Ethereum and @VitalikButerin is importance of communityWe will not do anything which hurts any community specially the retail community involved with $SHIBWe will act responsibly!Plz dont worry $SHIB holders. https://t.co/M4GxTR0JAn
Shiba inu coin is a meme token that plays off the dogecoin cryptocurrency, which was originally created as a joke but shot to popularity when tech billionaire Elon Musk showed interest in it.
Founded in 2013, dogecoin’s creators say it was intended as an ironic response to two big internet phenomena: cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, and a meme image of a Shiba Inu dog.
That gave the unit its unique name.
“From ‘that seems like it’s funny’ to actually doing it took about three hours,” co-founder Billy Markus, a video game-obsessed software engineer at IBM, told the news website CNET.
Users of Reddit forums then began using dogecoin, thanks to its previously extremely low prices, to welcome posters’ comments.
The price of the virtual unit hit a record high over the weekend ahead of Musk’s hosting of popular US sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL).
Dogecoin then tumbled because the Tesla and SpaceX founder joked on the show that dogecoin was a “hustle”.
Musk has also stepped up his attack on bitcoin, sending prices falling following a series of critical tweets yesterday.
Taking to Twitter, the 49-year-old Tesla CEO shared a graph which showed bitcoin’s electricity usage had soared during 2021.
“Energy usage trend over past few months is insane,” he posted.
In a previous tweet, he had revealed Tesla had suspended vehicle purchased using bitcoin.
“We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” the statement reads.
“Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.
“Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.”
Musk’s stinging criticism stunned investors, given his vocal support of cryptocurrency, and his comments sent prices plunging, dropping 15 per cent at one point to les than $A64,700.
Other cryptos, including ether and dogecoin, also fell and hundreds of billions of dollars was wiped from the total cryptocurrency market.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/not-acceptable-wuhan-scientist-hits-out-at-covid19-origin-claims/news-story/5f9c6e80eeb1806c670841a45ea33fbc
A group of 18 scientists has reignited the debate over whether COVID-19 escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.
The chief scientist for emerging disease at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, “Bat Lady” Dr Shi Zhengli has rejected fresh claims COVID-19 may have escaped from her lab as “sad” and “not acceptable”.
A group of 18 scientists including one of the world’s foremost coronavirus researchers has reignited the debate over whether COVID-19 escaped from a Wuhan lab overnight.
Warning there was not enough evidence to rule the option out, the group wrote to the prestigious Science magazine urging further investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 strain responsible for the global pandemic.
“We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,’’ the letter states.
“A proper investigation should be transparent, objective, data-driven, inclusive of broad expertise, subject to independent oversight, and responsibly managed to minimise the impact of conflicts of interest.
“Public health agencies and research laboratories alike need to open their records to the public. Investigators should document the veracity and provenance of data from which analyses are conducted and conclusions drawn, so that analyses are reproducible by independent experts.”
The signatories include respected scientists who are experts in SARS-CoV-2 research, including Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle; Ralph Baric, a coronavirus researcher who has collaborated with scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China and David Relman, a microbiologist and immunologist at Stanford University School of Medicine.
But Wuhan virologist Shi Zhengli, has hit back in an email to MIT Technology Review on Friday morning over calls for her to hand over her lab records.
“It’s definitely not acceptable,” Shi said. “Who can provide an evidence that does not exist?”
“It’s really sad to read this ‘Letter’ written by these 18 prominent scientists.
“The hypothesis of a lab leaking is just based on the expertise of a lab which has long been working on bat coronaviruses which are phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2.
“This kind of claim will definitely damage the reputation and enthusiasm of scientists who are dedicated to work on the novel animal viruses which have potential spillover risk to human populations and eventually weaken the ability of humans to prevent the next pandemic.”
The scientists’ letter does note the debate has the capacity to fuel anti-China sentiment.
“Finally, in this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus - often at great personal cost,’’ the letter to Science states.
“We should show the same determination in promoting a dispassionate science-based discourse on this difficult but important issue.”
A team of scientists sent to Wuhan, China, by the World Health Organisation to investigate the origins of COVID-19 have previously dismissed the hypothesis as “extremely unlikely”.
Peter Ben Embarek, a Danish food safety and animal disease specialist who chaired the investigation team said: “It isn’t a hypothesis we suggest implies further study.”
“Accidents do happen,” he said but he maintained the viruses kept in the Wuhan laboratory were genetically different from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
But the letter to Science magazine said the WHO investigation was too quick to discount the theories.
“In May 2020, the World Health Assembly requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general work closely with partners to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2 (2),’’ the letter states.
“In November, the Terms of Reference for a China–WHO joint study were released. The information, data, and samples for the study’s first phase were collected and summarised by the Chinese half of the team; the rest of the team built on this analysis.
“Although there were no findings in clear support of either a natural spillover or a lab accident, the team assessed a zoonotic spillover from an intermediate host as ‘likely to very likely’, and a laboratory incident as ‘extremely unlikely’.
“Furthermore, the two theories were not given balanced consideration. Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory accident.
“Notably, WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus commented that the report’s consideration of evidence supporting a laboratory accident was insufficient and offered to provide additional resources to fully evaluate the possibility.
“As scientists with relevant expertise, we agree with the WHO director-general, the United States and 13 other countries and the European Union that greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve.”
This is huge. Eminent virologist Jesse Bloom and Ralph Baric call for inquiry into possible lab leak. University of North Carolinaâs Baric did Gain of Function research with Shi Zhengli in 2015. For him to say his research partnerâs lab may have leaked SARS-CoV2 is significant. https://t.co/fS1jlEj6UY
Scientists who co-signed the letter have called for concerns the virus escaped from a lab to be the subject of more investigation and urged caution over the WHO report’s premature dismissal of the lab leak theory.
“Show us the test you used: What was the method? What were the results and the names of the people tested? Did you test a control population?” Dr David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University told the Los Angeles Times.
“On all accounts, it was not an adequate, detailed kind of presentation of data that would allow an outside scientist to arrive at an independent conclusion.”
“We’re reasonable scientists with expertise in relevant areas,” Relman said, “and we don’t see the data that says this must be of natural origin.”
WHO chief’s comments on origins of the virus
Even Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has previously expressed concern the lab theory should not be dismissed.
“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” he said in an address to WHO member states on March 30.
“Let me say clearly that, as far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table.”
Recently, the former New York Times and Science reporter Nicholas Wade published a 10,000-word article raising the possibility that COVID-19 was a human-engineered pathogen and that it had escaped.
The revelation features in my upcoming investigative book on the origins of COVID-19, called "What Really Happened In Wuhan," to be published by HarperÂ­Collins. You can order it here: https://t.co/ttZ1eWk3Mmpic.twitter.com/joVw3gIawI
He also accused the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of funding gain-of-function (GoF) research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
But questioned over the claims in a US Senate hearing top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci rejected the claim when questioned by Senator Rand Paul.
“Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely, entirely and completely incorrect. The NIH has not ever, and does not now, fund ‘gain of function research’ in the Wuhan Institute,’’ Dr Fauci said.
He insisted the NIH gave a grant to EcoHealth Alliance, “a non-profit focused on research that aims to prevent pandemics”, which then passed a part of it to the Wuhan Institute – but it was not intended for gain of function research.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health/pregnant-woman-issues-dire-covid19-warning-days-before-death/news-story/1ecba586807b11141c7bf24e328071d4
A pregnant woman in India recorded an emotional message days before dying from COVID-19, begging others to take the virus seriously.
A grieving husband has shared an emotional message recorded by his pregnant wife just days before she died from COVID-19.
Dimple Arora Chawla, a 34-year-old New Delhi doctor, recorded a video message days before her death begging people not to underestimate the virus.
India’s double-mutant strain of the virus has ravaged the country, with the nation seeing new record infections rates almost every week.
The latest daily figures show an increase of 362,727 cases and 4120 deaths. India has now confirmed more than 23.7 million infections and more than 256,000 deaths, however, experts have warned the real number is likely much higher.
Dimple, who was seven months pregnant, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on April 11. Six days into her illness she felt her symptoms worsening and decided to record a message in a bid to convince others about the deadly nature of this virus.
“I really want to tell each and every one, please don’t take corona so lightly,” she said in the video.
“Very bad, very bad symptoms. I am not able to speak, but I really want to convey my message to all.
“Please wear a mask whenever you go outside, whenever you interact with people for your near one dear ones’ safety.
“Please tell your family members, don’t take it so lightly. Don’t remove your mask.”
Dimple said she always wanted to work and was so active before contracting the virus but her “body is giving up now”.
Throughout the video, she could be seen struggling to breathe.
She finished the video with a simple plea: “Please, please take care,” she said.
Nine days after recording the message Dimple, along with her unborn baby, died.
Her husband Ravish Chawla shared his wife’s message to Twitter in the hopes others would heed her warning.
“She was completely devoted to motherhood and went to heavens with our unborn child to take care of him and left our 3.5-year child to me,” he wrote in a post on Mother’s Day.
RELATED: Nation ‘staring into COVID abyss’
Mr Chawla said his wife always took great care to protect herself from the virus, such as wearing double and triple masks and PPE when out in public.
He told local TV station NDTV his wife was admitted to hospital in late April when her health began to drastically deteriorate.
A few days after she was admitted she started to feel labour pains, with a subsequent ultrasound showing their baby had no heartbeat.
Mr Chawla couldn’t bring himself to tell his sick wife that their child had died after she went through an emergency caesarean.
“She said, ‘I want to see my baby, I want to see my baby,’” he said.
“In her anxiety, her oxygen levels started to drop. I somehow had to tell her: ‘Your baby is alive.’ I lied to her, which I did not want to do.”
Dimple died the following day, leaving behind her husband and their three-year-old son.

Bodies of suspected COVID victims washing up
India’s COVID-19 situation is showing no signs of improving, with overflowing hospitals, mass cremation sites and bodies washing up along the Ganges river among some the grim scenes occurring across the country.
Authorities have been forced to install a net across the river after dozens of suspected virus victims washed up on the shore.
The discovery of 71 corpses in Bihar state stoked fears that the virus was raging unseen in India’s vast rural hinterland where two-thirds of its people live.
Locals suggested to AFP that relatives immersed the bodies in the river because they could not afford wood for traditional Hindu cremations or because crematoriums were overwhelmed by the number of funerals.

Bihar’s water resources minister Sanjay Kumar said on Twitter on Wednesday that a “net has been placed” in the river on the state border with Uttar Pradesh and patrolling increased.
He said the impoverished state’s government was “pained at both the tragedy as well as harm to the river Ganges”.
Kumar added that post-mortems confirmed that the corpses had been dead four to five days.
Press reports said as many as 25 bodies had also been recovered in the Gahmar district of Uttar Pradesh state.
The Hindu daily quoted a local police official there as saying there were long queues at cremation grounds in the northern state.
“It is possible that in hurry some disposed of the bodies in the river like this,” Hitendra Krishna was quoted as saying.

Six people linked to an interstate quarantine hotel have been told to isolate in Victoria over fears they could have been potentially exposed.
Six Victorians are now isolating after potentially being exposed to COVID-19 while quarantining at the same Adelaide hotel where a Victorian man is thought to have caught it.
The health department revealed on Thursday the six were identified as having recently left level three of the Playford Hotel during the potential transmission period.
The six have all been contacted and are now undertaking 14 days quarantine since departing the Adelaide hotel. They were all being urgently tested on Thursday.
The Victorian man who caught the virus in hotel quarantine in Adelaide had completed his isolation there after returning to Australia from India via the Maldives on April 19.
The man, aged in his 30s, returned to his Wollert home in Melbourne’s north on May 4 and developed symptoms four days later.
He tested positive on Tuesday.
All three of his primary household contacts have so far tested negative.
Public health teams are continuing working to identify, test and trace people who’ve been in contact with the man.
Sites at Melbourne, Epping and Altona North are among the exposure sites, as well as a number of train stations and train services.
Victoria recorded no new local cases on Thursday.
despite 84 people being deemed close contacts of the man.
Acting Premier James Merlino said on Thursday that 67 people who came in contact
hadn’t contracted the virus after coming into contact with a Melbourne man who caught the virus in hotel quarantine in Adelaide.
He said a further 48 people were expected to receive their results within the next 24 to 36 hours.
One of the exposure sites was the Curry Vault restaurant in the CBD, where 42 patrons and staff were identified as primary close contacts.
So far, 34 negative test results have so far been returned.
SA Health has also ordered 10 South Australians who stayed on the same floor as the Victorian man in hotel quarantine to complete a further two weeks in isolation.
A total of 7,955 COVID-19 vaccination doses were administered on Wednesday by state-commissioned services across Victoria.

A new outbreak of COVID-19 is spreading rapidly through Vietnam, a nation once praised for containing its outbreaks quickly through targeted mass testing and its strict quarantine system.

Vietnam is currently in its fourth wave of COVID-19 since the pandemic began and a large wave was “inevitable”, according to Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Director Professor Guy Thwaites.

“They’re getting it under control, I’m pretty confident they will do so, yes, there were 100 cases on Monday but the number are slowly coming down now rather than going up,” he told Sky News. 

“They’re doing what they have done well in the past which is identifying infections, tracking, tracing, and quarantining very large quantities of people.”

Professor Thwaites said there was only one case in Ho Chi Minh City and but there have been “30-70 cases a day” for the last few days in Hanoi and Penang because the populace were getting relaxed about antivirus measures. 

“People have been a little bit relaxed about it and maintaining this level of vigilance and maintaining this level of awareness in the population that things could change if you don’t mask and keep social distance".

"That’s something that’s become more difficult unless vaccination are widespread soon.”

Australia appears closer to making mRNA vaccines onshore, while a supply deal for 25 million doses of the Moderna jab has been secured.
Health Minister Greg Hunt says he’s “confident” mRNA vaccines will be able to be produced on Australian soil in the near future, with his comments coming as Moderna announced a 25 million dose supply deal.
The drug manufacturer also announced its interest in building manufacturing capability in Australia, as the government allocated money for it in this week’s federal budget.
﻿Mr Hunt on Thursday said he hoped Australia would have at least one, if not more, manufacturing operation.
“I won’t make a guarantee on that, but I am confident that over the future period, we will have mRNA production in Australia,” Mr Hunt said.
“There are a range of potentially very viable approaches and proposals.”
Industry Minister Christian Porter will lead the approach to market in the next 10 days.
Moderna joins CSL and Biosena, which have publicly acknowledged their interest in establishing mRNA capability in Australia.
Mr Hunt said there was also others, but the government didn’t know if they would put forward proposals.
“Certainly we would prefer private-sector owned and operated. That is an important way to do it,” he said.
Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy said it was unlikely capability would be established this year.
“It is going to be some time next year, I would imagine, before mRNA vaccines can be produced here,” Professor Murphy said.
“MRNA vaccine technology is likely to be much broader than COVID vaccine. So it is something that we in Australia need to have anyway.
“Our primary vaccination strategy is in no way dependent on this.”
Professor Murphy said the capability would also aid flu and other novel vaccine manufacturing in the future.
“We are one of the small number of countries that have onshore sovereign vaccine manufacturing capability and we want to keep ahead of the game in that space,” he said.
Moderna chief executive Stéphane Bancel said the company plans to open a commercial subsidiary in Australia this year.
“We appreciate the partnership and support from the government of Australia with this first supply agreement for doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and our variant booster candidates,” Mr Bancel said in a statement.
“We look forward to continuing discussions with Australia about establishing potential local manufacturing opportunities.”
CSL will continue to manufacture doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, which does not use mRNA technology, in Victoria.

A scathing independent review commissioned by the World Health Organisation has slammed the health body’s failure to act quickly during the early days of the pandemic.

The review found the WHO was too slow to declare a public health emergency, there was a failure to impose travel restrictions and countries failed to respond to the warnings quickly enough.

The expert panel recommended a global alert system be put in place which is allowed to publish information without the permission of impacted countries.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison played a pivotal role in calling for the review and addressed the conclusions this morning on 2GB radio.

“I was mocked, I was bagged, the Labor Party mocked me, but I said it and now the WHO has come out and recommended the same thing,” he said.

Confusion continues over when Aussies will get two COVID-19 jabs, with another minister weighing in on the government’s plan.
Australians were never expected to have two COVID-19 doses before the end of 2021, Aged Care Services Minister Richard Colbeck says.
The development comes as Moderna has also announced it will supply 25 million vaccines doses to Australia under a new supply deal.
Confusion continues over the vaccine timeline after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday handed down the federal budget, which was based on the assumption that a “population-wide vaccination program” would likely be in place by the end of the year.
“The assumption is that every Australian who wants to get two shots of the vaccine (will be able to) by the end of the year,” Mr Frydenberg said.
But Mr Colbeck said the government aspired to get everyone who wants a vaccine their first dose.
“For it to be two doses, you will have to bring that forward significantly and that’s never been part of our plans … because there was 12 weeks between doses,” Mr Colbeck told ABC’s RN.
“So I don’t see where that suggestion comes from.”
Under a new supply agreement announced by Moderna on Wednesday night, Australia has secured 25 million doses of the mRNA vaccine.
This includes 10 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine against the ancestral strain to be delivered in 2021, and 15 million doses of the company’s updated variant booster vaccine candidate to be delivered in 2022.
Moderna is yet to apply for approval from Australia’s drug regulator but says it expects to submit an application shortly.
Scott Morrison said first doses would support the vaccine rollout later this year among people aged under 50.
The prime minister said the government was trying to bring forward the rollout of additional Pfizer doses into the third quarter, while five million people could get Moderna, which is due to arrive in the fourth quarter.
“There is then another 15 million of what is called booster doses,” Mr Morrison told 6PR.
“That is a different vaccine again, that is next year, and that is to deal with possible variants.
“We are now well in the phase of what is coming next because the pandemic is not going anywhere.”
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler welcomed the Moderna announcement but questioned why it had taken so long.
“If the rest of the world struck deals with Moderna as early as last year for access to this state-of-the-art vaccine, why do Australians have to wait to the end of this year?” he said.
“What happened to Scott Morrison’s promise that Australians were at the front of the vaccine queue?”
Labor treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers accused the government of playing catch up.
“What has been obvious to everybody else is that the government didn’t do enough deals to get the vaccination program going as well as it should be,” Dr Chalmers said.
“That has costs and consequences for the vaccine rollout and therefore for the economy.”
Outspoken crossbench Senator Jacqui Lambie told Today the Moderna announcement came out of nowhere.
“I’m still trying to work out how I can lie that I’m under 50 … so I can get the Pfizer shot,” she joked.
Mr Colbeck said about 80 per cent of the aged care sector, excluding the workforce, had now been vaccinated.
“We’ll have all aged care residents having had their first dose in the next couple of weeks,” Mr Colbeck said.
He said advice from the US recommended against vaccinating workers and residents at the same time because it affected care delivery.
This came on top of health advice about blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Mr Colbeck said prompted authorities to “reset the workforce rollout”.
This is how a man’s appointment with a sex worker for a “girlfriend experience” turned into a stabbing rampage that terrified a whole city.
Sparks flew in court as a challenge to Christian Porter’s lawyer collided with a preliminary hearing in his defamation case against the ABC.

An independent report has found the World Health Organisation was too slow in declaring a public health emergency after the emergence of COVID-19 in China.

The WHO commissioned review also claimed "a month of inaction" allowed the disease to spread rapidly. 

It recommended a new global alert system to swiftly address future health threats without the approval of impacted countries. 

The panel also called on wealthy nations to fund vaccines, drugs, and medical supplies for the world.

The damning findings will be debated at a global assembly later this month.

Nationals MP Dr Anne Webster says Australians need to “step up” if we want to open international border and bring life back to a state where “we’re not living with the anxiety” of COVID-19.

“We definitely want people getting the vaccination, and there is hesitation,” she told Sky News host Chris Kenny.

“We want them to feel confident that it is the right thing to do.

“If we’re going to move out of this pandemic that really is the road forward.”

Authorities have confirmed the source Victoria’s latest case as contact tracers search for fans who attended a AFL match amid fears they may have been exposed to COVID-19.
This coronavirus article is unlocked and free to read in the interest of community health and safety. Click here for full digital access to trusted news from the Herald Sun and Leader.
Genomic sequencing has confirmed a Melbourne man caught coronavirus in hotel quarantine in South Australia.
The Department of Health revealed late on Wednesday that 28 patrons and staff who attended the Curry Vault CBD exposure site have been identified as primary close contacts, and 16 negative test results have so far been returned.
A further 17 people who attended the Pact Altona North exposure site were identified as primary close contacts, with 11 negative test results returned.
Eight people who attended the Indiagate Epping exposure site have also been identified as primary close contacts. Five of those have so far been returned.
Another 28 people who attended the Woolworths Epping exposure site have been identified as contacts, with nine negative test results so far been returned.
Hundreds of footy fans have been urged to get tested and immediately isolate, as fears grow they may have been exposed to the virus.
The strict direction comes as the Health Department listed a Craigieburn-bound train from Flinders Street as a Tier-2 exposure site.
The exposure site times coincided with the end of the blockbuster clash between Richmond and Geelong on Friday May 7.
The AFL has been brought in to help track people who were leaving the game at this time, and may have caught the same train with the infected man.
Health Minister Martin Foley confirmed the government was also in the process of scouring through CCTV footage from Metro Trains to determine how many people shared a carriage with the man.
He said it wasn’t yet known how many commuters were on the train at the time, but believed there could have been “hundreds” of people on board.
People who were on the 10.20pm service from Flinders Street to Craigieburn — in any carriage, and alighting and department at any station — should get tested and immediately isolate until returning a negative result.
Anyone who travelled around this time, but is unsure about the service they caught, is urged to also get tested.
It comes as the Health Department confirmed no new local cases of COVID-19 were detected in Victoria on Tuesday.
One interstate case, a man from Wollert who’s positive test sparked the latest health scare.
More than 20,000 people got tested and 8146 vaccines were administrated in the past 24 hours.
It comes as authorities revealed the restaurant wasn’t actively enforcing QR code check ins.
“The challenges at that site … frankly the QR code, whilst it was in place, wasn’t widely taken up by all the patrons,” he said.
“This is a wake up call to both operators and patrons to step up and use the services.
“This is a reminder that the quality and the speed of the public health response is directly linked to the record keeping that operators and customers use.”
Mr Foley said DHHS was able to contact everyone “instantly” who used the QR code to check in at the Curry Vault, but the state government was working with banks to track people via credit card transactions used at the Curry Vault.
“Our teams are working through QR codes, financial transactions, the takeaway transactions of that facility, just to make sure that we run down anyone that might have been associated with that facility,” he said.
“We’re working with the banks and the operator of the T1 site to just compare his data and his records with the financial transactions.
“We do have the data, even if it did take some time, be it through the delivery sources or credit card transactions to track down everyone who used that venue,” he said.
He urged everyone to ensure they check in at venues across Melbourne.
“It slows down the response when people haven’t taken that opportunity,” he said.
Businesses who flout QR code check-in rules could face fines of up to $10,000.
Mr Foley said 17 primary close contacts linked to the PACT retail site — where the infected person spent the most time — were currently being tested.
DHHS has also sent messages to passengers who were on Jetstar flight JQ771 on May 4, asking them to come forward for testing.
While Mr Foley said he didn’t think the Jetstar flight was a place of acquisition, passengers should get tested as a precaution.
“We think the likelihood of flight being acquisition site is highly improbable,” he said.
A further 396,000 text messages have been sent to people living near exposure sites.
He said testing had been “ramped up” in the northern and western suburbs.
“You can do you bit by getting tested. If you are eligible for a vaccine, get vaccinated,” he said.
“Victoria is doing what it can to ensure everyone is safe from the COVID virus and one of the most important things Victorians can do with the opportunity to get vaccinated is to take it.”
The Craigieburn train exposure site times coincided with the end of the Richmond and Geelong AFL match on Friday, May 7, with the AFL asked to help track people who attended the game.
Hundreds of people are believed to have been on the train at the time and are urged to get tested.
Mr Foley said results of the genomic sequencing could be available later today.
Wait times at COVID testing sites in Melbourne’s north have blown out to more than an hour after Northern Health temporarily suspended testing.
The estimated waiting time at Northern Health had stretched beyond 80 minutes.
A state government site co-ordinator at Epping’s Memorial Hall told the Herald Sun wait times at the community building had already spiked as a result.
She said testing sites across the Epping area had been dealing with an influx of residents waiting to get tested after Tuesday’s alert.
She encouraged residents to drive to other nearby sites, such as Childs Rd, until Northern Health reopened.
Cars continued to queue behind 30 vehicles already snaking through the hall’s car park, with traffic controls stationed at entry and exit points to the hall.
Authorities have not changed Victoria’s COVID restrictions, with the relaxed rules introduced on April 9 still in place.
Masks are compulsory in taxis, ride shares, on public transport, flights and while visiting an airport, hospital or care facility.
Hundreds of Victorians have been ordered to isolate after the man returned a positive test in Melbourne.
Train passengers were on Tuesday night also ordered into isolation, after the Health Department revealed the infected man from Wollert in Melbourne’s north travelled on public transport.
Authorities were scrambling to determine whether commuters may have been exposed to the virus last week.
Anyone who caught the 5.28pm Craigieburn to Southern Cross service on Friday, May 7, or the 10.20pm Flinders Street to Craigieburn service on the same night, must get tested and isolate immediately.
Both services have been deemed a Tier 2 exposure site by the Health Department.
“If you were on this service – in any carriage, and alighting and departing at any station – follow the health advice,” a statement reads.
Long queues were forming in the northern suburbs on Wednesday morning as residents scrambled to get tested for the virus.
Cars waiting in line at a testing site at 4Cyte Pathology in Epping formed a growing queue down Childs Rd.
Lalor resident Maria, 43, who decided to get tested to protect her sick and elderly father, said she had been waiting in line “for a while”.
“I should have come yesterday,” she said.
“I was going to come anyway but the alerts for these areas prompted me to come sooner.”
Maria said she had some COVID-like symptoms and wanted to rule out coronavirus.
A traffic control worker co-ordinating cars at the small drive-through site told the Herald Sun it was “so busy”.
“Our staff are working all over the city to co-ordinate these centres,” he said.
“People are co-operating but it is a lot.”
As about 40 cars built up on the road and inside the testing site, Epping local Murat Ates, 40, said he was prepared to wait in line to take precautions for his young family.
Mr Ates said health authorities’ alert for the Epping area on Tuesday prompted him to be tested because he had experienced flu-like symptoms.
“The whole area should just be careful and get tested, that’s why I’m here,” he said.
The locals’ concerns come after the Health Department on Tuesday warned hundreds of Epping, Altona North and CBD residents to get tested.
Flinders Street, Southern Cross and Craigieburn stations have all been deemed Tier 3 exposure sites, meaning anyone who was at any of these stations on May 7 must monitor for COVID symptoms.
States and territories have been quick to hit Victorian travellers with new requirements after recording the shock new case.
Alerts were also issued on ­Tuesday for exposure sites in Melbourne’s CBD, Epping and Altona North between ­Thursday and Saturday last week. Health investigators believe the man, aged in his 30s, was infected while in hotel ­quarantine at The Playford Hotel.
A patient in an adjacent hotel room on May 4 tested positive to COVID-19 — the same day the man was released from his 14 days of isolation and flew to Melbourne.
He went home to Wollert in the northern suburbs but began feeling unwell on May 8. He took a coronavirus test on Monday and returned a positive result on Tuesday.
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said it was unlikely the man was infectious during his first two days in Victoria.
Passengers on his May 4 flight do not have to isolate.
“The flight is unlikely to be something to chase up. The fourth is not a day that we expect him to be infectious,” Prof Sutton said.
“But, with variants of concern and the evolution of the virus all the time, we have to be alive to the possibility.”
Genomic testing is expected to confirm the source of the man’s infection within 48 hours. He flew from coronavirus-ravaged India, via the Maldives and Singapore, before landing in Adelaide.
But South Australian chief health officer Nicola Spurrier said the man tested negative to COVID-19 on days one, five and 13 of his quarantine.
Although health authorities were working on the presumption the virus may have been passed within Victoria, Prof Sutton said negative tests from the man’s three relatives were an “encouraging sign”.
“It is an early encouraging sign that the household contacts have tested negative, on the basis that he has been home with them and symptomatic from the 8th (of May), and probably infectious from the 6th,’’ he said.
Four Tier 1 exposure sites were announced, and people who had been there in the specified period must be tested and isolate immediately.
Melbourne CBD business Citadel Health was cleared to reopen Tuesday afternoon after the negative test by a relative of the man, who visited the Collins St premises.
Curry Vault Indian Restaurant and Bar owner Kailash Sharma, whose city eatery was named a tier-1 exposure site, said he was “devastated”.
Mr Sharma said his business had lost more than $100,000 last year.
“We are closed for a deep clean until 10pm tonight and all affected staff have self-isolated,” he said on Tuesday.
“It’s very concerning, it’s such a terrible feeling when innocent people are caught up in this.”
Prof Sutton said the latest case served as a reminder to renew safe practices and continue using QR codes.
He warned vaccines would not slow the spread of local COVID-19 outbreaks until 60-70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, meaning measures such as lockdowns remained a defence for future clusters.
“The government has had months to prepare for this sort of scenario,” opposition health spokeswoman Georgie Crozier said. “It’s critical that we have contact tracing in place otherwise the entire state will be at risk of yet another lockdown.”
Victoria had gone 73 days without a locally acquired case.
Travellers arriving in NSW from Melbourne will now need to complete a declaration form confirming they have not attended a public exposure site.

Hundreds of thousands more Victorians will be able to get Pfizer jabs from next week, as Victoria records another day of no new cases. Here’s who will be eligible.
The first load of Australians are preparing to leave India, while the UK faces a lockdown extension as the new COVID-19 variant spreads.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/breaking-news/undercover-police-officers-to-keep-eye-on-covid19-checkin-skippers/news-story/17773a96472254779736e03a9b2eba65
Tougher new measures involving undercover police officers will be put in place to stop wrongdoers from ignoring COVID-19 directions.
Tougher measures are being put in place by South Australian police to stamp out complacency surrounding the use of QR codes.
Operation Trace — which will begin on Thursday — will see plain clothed police officers on the look out for wrongdoers skipping past COVID-19 check-ins at a number of businesses, like supermarkets and restaurants.
Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said SA police had long taken an educational approach to QR codes but expected the community to understand the requirements by now.
He said the state currently has about 1 million people checking in daily, with officers checking up on about 100 businesses during that same time period.
“We are seeing a level of complacency regarding COVID-19 check-ins and now is not the time to stop,” he said.
“If you speak to any person in the street, they'll tell you about their observations regarding people simply walking past those QR codes.
“SA has done very well so far … these steps have been taken to make sure that if we do have an outbreak in South Australia, SA Health are in the best position to respond and minimise the likelihood of us having to move to more harsh restrictions as a result.
“The outbreak from SA’s medical hotel is a great reminder to us that whilst this particular individual travelled to Victoria, they could just as easily have moved back into the SA community.”
The Commissioner — who is also the State Coordinator for coronavirus — said he anticipated “a large number” of people to be spoken to during the operation.
He said the undercover officers would have their identification to prove they were legitimate officers when speaking to wrongdoers.
SA Police also have a mechanism in place that keeps track of all people that have been spoken to in order to assess their level of compliance.
“My hope is that they'll go home and talk to their friends and relatives about the fact that they were stopped and spoken to by police.
“Hopefully the message will move through the community that we take this seriously and it's important that people do the right thing.”
Commissioner Stevens could not provide an exact number of officers that would be deployed under the task force because it depended on the number of officers needed for other operational demands.
But, he warned police were making a concerted effort to visit as many places on a random basis as possible.
Trace officers will also remind businesses of their requirement to make QR codes as well as a hard copy signing process readily available to all customers.
Under current laws, individuals found to breach COVID-19 directions can be slapped with a $1060 fine while businesses can cop a $5060 expiation.
The operation will run from May 13-21 but the Commissioner said it could be extended.
The Brisbane Bullets stunned a hapless Sydney Kings outfit on Thursday night, giving their playoff hopes are vital shot in the arm.
More than 40 people set to get on an evacuation flight out of India - that had 150 Australians booked - have tested positive to coronavirus.

Zero cases is the daily statistic all Australians long to hear of, while one case sends us into panic. It’s a strange reaction and it has to stop.
COMMENT
So that’s it then, Australia’s borders are closed until mid-2022.
On page 36 of budget paper 1 was the bad news for anyone with a family overseas: “Inbound and international travel is expected to remain low through to mid-2022”.
Almost 30 per cent of Australians are first generation immigrants, many with parents overseas.
With a resigned sigh, some of those are now considering leaving jobs and homes here and emigrating back from whence they came. They don’t want to, but if the choice is between Australia and seeing elderly parents, some will choose the latter.
Much of the border barricading appears to be down one number: zero, and its irresistible allure. It’s an almost unique and bizarre Australian phenomenon.
Not zero, but actually kinda zero
The depressing budget forecast came days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison was reported as saying borders would be closed “indefinitely” as there was a “target of zero cases”. He later said he’d been “misreported” and there was no “zero” target.
But he did say vaccinated people might only be allowed to travel if there was “clear evidence that this prevents transmissibility”.
Official policy or not, that sounds a lot like a strategy to ensure zero — or near zero — COVID-19 cases cross the border and get out into the community.
That might make sense right now; no one is suggesting the frontier should be flung open a week next Tuesday. It will no longer make sense if, down the line, vaccines do their job and serious cases of COVID plummet.
Closed borders will then look less like a health measure, and more like a political ploy.
BAD NEWS ON BORDERS - page 36, Budget Paper No 1 for those who want to hit the books https://t.co/YCamLCYNHP@newscomauHQpic.twitter.com/70Ck8NJ2Ak
Australia has fetishised zero cases. We’ve become intoxicated by our virus success. A single positive case in the community can send a city into panicked lockdown and lead to supermarket shelves being stripped.
Conversely, we love a doughnut day; even better a double doughnut day, of no cases in the community or in quarantine.
Australia’s success at almost entirely keeping COVID out is remarkable. No one wanted to go through the pain that the UK endured as it fumbled through the first months of the pandemic.
We’ve rewarded premiers who have promised the most hardline COVID approach with landslide election victories. The PM now appears to have taken note with it looking very possible borders will remain essentially shut until after the 2022 federal election, which could be as late as September of next year.
Keeping the frontier closed during 2022 is about fear: fear of more than zero cases, and fear of losing the election.
If you’re the PM, why would you risk easing the border open beyond New Zealand if you’ll get slammed by voters for a single case crossing the threshold? Even if, after we’re vaccinated, it might cause very little harm?
RELATED: Shock prediction on international borders
Australia’s bizarre fascination with zero cases
Zero cases is a potent drug.
Like all drugs it has harmful side effects. Not just for families but for the tourism, hospitality and transport industries who will miss out on international visitors if the border remains closed for longer than necessary. Businesses will shut, jobs will be lost.
Zero might soothe us now, but this drug could lead to a collective madness about borders if we demand they remain shut even after we’re jabbed. Zero is a drug we will have to wean ourselves off once most of us are vaccinated. But why get vaccinated, some might ponder, if there’s no prospect of travel? Easier just to let zero keep us safe.
How we should judge COVID success
In March, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said case numbers should be replaced by hospitalisation rates as the future metric to judge COVID success by.
“Zero community transmissions are easy to achieve when we’ve got no international travel,” she told radio station 2GB.
“We need to change our measure or we will be left behind as a nation if we don’t think about travelling internationally.
“What is a good measure of success is keeping people alive and keeping them out of hospital.”
Zero may never be achieved globally. What then?
Earlier this year, journal Nature commented on the “coronavirus-free” life of Western Australia. For the globe, however, WA was merely a “beautiful dream,” an “improbable” model of what will likely never be elsewhere.
Many scientists now believe COVID-19 will become endemic. That is, it won’t be eradicated and will continue to circulate but vaccines will have a double effect: infections will drop and those that do catch the virus will have a far less serious condition. Booster jabs and shots adapted for new variants will be the norm.
For most nations, reducing COVID transmission to low levels with few if any serious cases is the target — not zero.
We don’t yet know if that will come to pass. But the signs from countries with high rates of inoculation are promising.
In the UK, where 27 per cent of people are fully vaccinated, 2000 cases a day are being recorded. Sounds a lot — but that’s down from a high of 67,000 in a single day in January. On Monday, no one died of COVID-19 in England, and that’s with three quarters of the population still yet to get there full dose.
Israel has vaccinated 56 per cent of its residents. It had 43 cases yesterday and zero deaths. Fully vaxxed Bhutan has had one death – throughout the whole pandemic.
If, in a few months’ time, countries like Israel and the UK are continuing to see some cases but few hospitalisations, Australia will have to question its zero cases fixation.
Australia’s sluggish vaccine rollout means it could indeed take until 2022 to vaccinate everyone. But if it picks up the pace and many Aussies, including those most at risk, get jabbed earlier, what then?
The single-minded focus on zero cases alone will become harder to justify as more people get their AstraZeneca or Pfizer shot.
Fully vaccinated Aussies will begin to ask why vaccinated Brits and Israelis, Americans and Spaniards, can jet off to see family but they can’t. Zero could mean people’s grandmas and grandpas, mothers and fathers will die needlessly separated from their Aussie loved ones, with last goodbyes done via Zoom.
The reality is the rest of the world may never get to zero cases but will carry on, just with far fewer people falling ill. If Australia insists on zero cases, we’ll carry on too, just with borders closed indefinitely and immigrants making heartbreaking decisions about whether to stay or go.

The new surge in cases has ravaged major cities, including the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai, pushing hospitals to breaking point and leading to severe shortages in oxygen and beds
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that a variant of Covid-19 behind the acceleration of India's explosive outbreak has been found in dozens of countries all over the world.
The UN health agency said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, first found in India in October, had been detected in more than 4,500 samples uploaded to an open-access database "from 44 countries in all six WHO regions".

Queensland’s chief health officer has allayed fears Qantas ground staff were forced to come into close contact with a COVID-positive traveller.
A traveller who arrived from Papua New Guinea posed “no risk” to airport staff, Queensland’s chief health officer says, after reports emerged ground employees were told to “open the door and run”.
The Courier Mail reported on Wednesday that Qantas staff had described the arrival of Air Niugini flight PX003 on May 7 as an “absolute cock up”.
They were reportedly told there was a COVID-positive passenger on board, which has since been vehemently denied by health authorities.
A Qantas spokesman confirmed to NCA NewsWire that Brisbane Airport had been alerted 30 minutes prior to the flight’s arrival that there was a “potential case on board”.
However, Jeannette Young said the man in question had fully recovered from the virus and would not have been allowed to fly if he had been positive.
“The good thing that we’ve seen in Queensland is that everyone has been very cautious … That has stood us well,” Dr Young said.
“There was no need for this to have happened. This was a fully recovered, historic case - that’s why he was given permission to travel to Australia.
“Anyone who tests positive before getting on a plane is not allowed to travel until they are fully recovered.
“I do not criticise the airport or anyone there for taking an ultra-cautious approach … but they do not need to have been concerned. He was fully recovered.”
The Qantas spokesman said there were a “number of strict procedures in place for managing aircraft arriving from overseas”.
“Qantas ground staff followed all procedures,” he said.
Fully decked in PPE, Qantas ground staff were instructed to open the doors and leave the area, as is standard procedure, and had no contact with anyone inside the plane.
The aircraft was taken over by health and border authorities, in line with protocol.
Dr Young said while the man concerned did not have the virus, “we do not know that anyone else on that plane did not have COVID”.
“There could always be a positive case on that plane … We need to treat every single person on one of those flights from PNG, or anywhere, as potentially being infectious,” she said.
“This particular individual did not cause any risk, but there might have been others who did.”
The man is currently in hotel quarantine, where he will serve the mandatory 14 days.
Queensland recorded three new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, all overseas acquired and in hotel quarantine.

The World Health Organization said Wednesday that a variant of Covid-19 behind the acceleration of India's explosive outbreak has been found in dozens of countries all over the world.
The UN health agency said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, first found in India in October, had been detected in sequences uploaded to the GISAID open-access database "from 44 countries in all six WHO regions," adding it had received "reports of detections from five additional countries".

Finance Minister Simon Birmingham says Australia is the only country in the developed world to see more people in work today than before the pandemic.

"We've been able to - because of the management through the COVID crisis - to get to a point where we're seeing strong economic growth," he said.

"We're the only country across the developed world to be in that position where we've actually got more people back in work pre-pandemic. Everybody else is still struggling to get back to that starting point. 

"That has given us the window of opportunity to be able to invest in our aged care services, in our mental health services, in careful, targeted ways, but in ways that keep our net debt lower than forecasted in our last budget."

Net debt is expected to climb to $980.6 billion by 2024/25.

States have reacted after Victoria recorded a new case of COVID-19, with some people being told to go into quarantine.
Travellers who have recently returned to Western Australia from Victoria have been warned they must get tested for COVID-19 immediately after an outbreak of the virus in the eastern state.
It comes after a man aged in his 30s tested positive for coronavirus in Melbourne after completing 14 days of quarantine in a South Australian hotel.
Western Australia has been criticised by some for slamming its border shut whenever there has been an outbreak in another jurisdiction, but health authorities have been slowly moving away from that method.
The health department has issued an alert, saying anyone who has been to exposure sites in Victoria at the specified times should get tested immediately for COVID-19 and quarantine for 14 days from the date of exposure.
The case was likely infectious from May 6 to 10, Western Australia's chief health officer Andy Robertson said in a statement.
Anyone who has travelled to the state from Victoria is also urged to monitor the Victorian Health website for exposure locations as contact tracing continues.
“We believe any risk to WA remains very low,” Dr Robertson said.
“However, the situation highlights the importance of remaining vigilant to prevent any spread of the virus or community transmission in this state.
“We will continue to monitor the situation in Victoria very closely and issue updated health advice if required.”
Meanwhile, Queensland health authorities are warning anyone who has been to an exposure site — who is already in Queensland or will enter Queensland before 1am on Thursday — must call 134 COVID and immediately travel by private transport then quarantine for 14 days.
Anyone arriving in Queensland after that date must undertake mandatory hotel quarantine for two weeks.
“We are asking all Queensland to continue to monitor the list of interstate exposure venues for 14 days after you arrive to ensure no new venues have been added,” a statement read.
“We are also asking all Queenslanders to reconsider travel to Victoria.”
New South Wales Health says authorities are continuing to closely monitor the situation in Victoria.
People arriving from the Greater Melbourne area from 6am on Wednesday must complete a declaration that confirms they have not attended a venue of concern.
Anyone who has attended any of the exposure venues at the times listed must contact New South Wales Health immediately on 1800 943 553.
“These declaration forms provide critical information to enable New South Wales Health to contact travellers if required and is for all travellers who intend to enter New South Wales by air, road and rail having been in Greater Melbourne in the previous 14 days,” a statement read.

The Victorian man who tested positive after completing hotel quarantine in South Australia has returned another positive test, but his three household contacts have not.

He underwent the mandatory 14-day quarantine period in South Australia after returning to Australia and arrived back in Victoria on May 4.

He began displaying COVID symptoms when he returned to his Wollert home on May 8 and got tested on May 10 before returning a positive result on Tuesday morning.

Victoria Health Minister Martin Foley outlined the tier-one sites the infected man visited. People who visited these sites must get tested and isolate for 14 days.

“Firstly, the Melbourne CBD, the Curry Vault Indian restaurant and bar at 18 to 20 Bank Place between 6:30pm and 9:30pm on Friday, 7 May," Mr Foley said,

“Secondly, in Epping, Indiagate Spices and Groceries at unit 14 C, 560 - 590 High St, Epping between 5pm and 6pm on Saturday eight May.”

The tier-two sites listed require people to return a negative COVID-19 test result.

“The first site is in Altona North. It is the TIC group, which is a warehouse, it is the rear warehouse section at 200 and 32 Blackshaw Road, all day on Thursday 6 May. 

“In Epping at 7-11, and that is the 7-11 at 705 High St, which is on the corner of Cowper Street between 6:30pm and 7pm on Thursday six May, and the Epping 7-11 again at the same site, 705 High St on the corner of Cowper Street between 11:10am and 11:40am on Saturday, 8 May.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia is “moving beyond emergency responses” to the pandemic and has begun the recovery phase.

The prime minister said the upcoming budget will show how the government was “protecting Australia” against the COVID-19 pandemic.

“How we create jobs, how we guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, whether it be in aged care or mental health, the National Disability Insurance Scheme,” Mr Morrison said.

“It's against that pandemic background that tonight's budget is framed. We will continue to take responsible action to save lives and to save livelihoods.

“While moving beyond emergency responses as we have been doing for these last 18 months, we move into the recovery phase and continue to provide the support that both Australians need, to protect their lives, and to protect their livelihoods.”

Anthony Mundine says there are “evil plans” to reduce the global population, suggesting the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is “blatant genocide”.
Veteran broadcaster Ray Hadley has blasted Australian boxing great Anthony Mundine for calling the COVID-19 vaccine rollout “blatant genocide” and suggesting there are “evil plans” in place to enforce global depopulation — while offering no proof to back up his outrageous claims.
Mundine shared a bizarre post to his Facebook page on Monday afternoon, calling on his followers to “do your research” about the coronavirus.
The 45-year-old claimed, without any supporting evidence whatsoever, the vaccine paralyses the body’s immune system. In actuality, vaccines work by training the immune system to fight diseases.
“You take the shot then you will have serious health problems even death!” Mundine wrote.
“There (sic) evil plans are to depopulate the world to 1 billion people we are at 7/8 billion now … this is blatant genocide on the human race with a virus that has 99.7% recovery rate!
“I’ll let my immune system go to work cause if you take the shot your immune system becomes paralysed!
“DON'T TAKE IT! DO YOUR RESEARCH.”
Mundine’s plea to his social media followers goes against all recommended health advice, with medical professionals urging people to get vaccinated when they can.
Speaking on his 2GB radio show on Tuesday, Hadley laid into Mundine.
“In the past, I’ve ignored your rantings … because I think at the base of it you’re not a bad person. But this irresponsible stupidity that you’re now posting can cause great concern for people,” Hadley said.
“Anthony, I’ll take my medical advice from professors and doctors, not you.
“You read that somewhere on the internet, did you, Anthony? Or did someone read it to you?
“It’s just mind-boggling that a young man who’s reasonably intelligent, one would hope, could come out with such unadulterated bulls**t. Because that’s exactly what it is.”
The government’s handling of Australia’s vaccine rollout has come under fire for not matching the speed and efficiency of other vaccination efforts around the world.
Last month Prime Minister Scott Morrison scrapped plans to announce a new deadline to vaccinate all Australians by the end of the year against COVID-19 in an admission over the “uncertainties” surrounding the program.
Vaccination efforts have also been complicated by a small number of cases of people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine developing blood clots. Around four to six people out of every million suffered the rare illness after receiving the AstraZeneca shot.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) subsequently advised everyone under the age of 50 to receive an alternative to the AstraZeneca shot.
More than 200,000 Australians have participated in feeding back data on the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. Some 51.8 per cent of respondents reported some kind of adverse reaction, but only 1.2 per cent experienced reactions serious enough for them to seek medical attention.
Mundine retired from professional boxing following a first-round knockout defeat against Michael Zerafa in March.
The former rugby league star was an embarrassment in his final fight, failing to lay a glove on Zerafa and being knocked down twice in two minutes.
Mundine had won just one fight since 2014 and lost five of his final six bouts, taking his official record to 48-11.
The former world champion had “retired” several times before, most notably after his brutal loss to Jeff Horn three years ago.
Adam Reynolds could just be the start. Faced with a super tight salary cap, Souths may have to let go of more players, plus SBW boxing return and D-Day for Warriors. It’s Sports Confidential.

An infectious diseases expert says more travel bubbles will be opening between Australia and other countries within the next few months.
Speaking to Channel 9’s Today Show, Professor Robert Booy at the University of Sydney said despite the federal government pointing to a 2022 reopening, he believes more corridors will open this year.

The comments come as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australian borders will be reopened in 2022 under a “cautious approach”, but there’s a huge wildcard driving uncertainty about when and how quickly that will happen.
“We have New Zealand, we’ll have many more,” he explained.
“Pacific Islands – we’ll have more places, perhaps in Asia as they totally clamp down and have high vaccination rates as well.
“We’ll get to a point where this virus is more like a cold – that too will help us open up.”
According to Tuesday’s budget preview, the Morrison Government has conceded the big question around the reopening of the border remains the threat that people who are vaccinated may still be able to catch and spread COVID, even if the vaccine means it will no longer kill them.

Booster shots may also be required to improve the immunity of travellers who go to regions with new variants that are immune to the first generation vaccines.
It’s that uncertainty that’s driving delays and caution over the reopening of Australia’s international borders that will likely be delivered in a staggered changes that test the impact of each small step to return to normal.
With the trans-Tasman travel bubble up and running, where we could be allowed to travel to next has been hot on the agenda.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously mentioned places like Singapore and Japan and South Korea, but despite the corridor across the ditch – no further locations have moved forward on.

A recent COVID-19 case in Sydney that has stumped NSW Health officials has prompted the state’s chief health officer to issue a stern warning.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant has stressed the importance of using QR codes to check into businesses as COVID-19 contact tracers scramble to find the source of infection for a man from Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
A man aged in his 50s and his wife became the first locally-acquired cases of the virus in NSW in more than a month when they tested positive last week.
Although the man’s genetic sequencing is a perfect match for a returned traveller from the US in hotel quarantine, NSW Health is yet to trace the exact point of transmission.
Authorities continue to believe he caught the virus during brief contact with an infectious person who was likely running errands in the community.
“The team has been thinking of every which way this transmission could have occurred,” Dr Chant told 2GB on Tuesday.
“(So far it is a) case that’s popped up in the eastern suburbs without explanation.
“We’ve always got to keep an open mind that there could be another source.
“This always adds uncertainty but at the moment we don’t have any clear crossover point for this gentleman.”
NSW Health has listed nine venues as close contact, which requires people who visited during allocated times to self-isolate for 14 days regardless of their test result.
Dr Chant urged businesses and their customers to continue vigilantly signing in using the Service NSW app’s QR code.
“This is a wake up call … the QR codes, we really need those and people to be using them,” she said.
“I think people can get a bit complacent.
“We have asked people to make sure they are in prominent places (within stores).
“We want to make sure there's no other transmission occurring in the community that we are missing.
“(COVID-19) can be quite mild ... so people might be putting off getting a test. But we need everyone pulling together … and come forward for testing.”
Australia has done sensationally well in suppressing COVID-19 – but the country risks North Korea-style isolation if one thing doesn’t change.

“But the result is spectacular good. Better than the government expected, better than the RBA expected.

Athletes ran to an eerily empty stadium at a test event in Tokyo ahead of the Summer Olympics
Schools and stores reopened in several parts of Europe on Monday as the continent eased out of months of Covid-19 lockdowns, but India remained in the grip of a devastating outbreak.
Rapid vaccination programmes have allowed a number of wealthy nations to start taking steps towards normality, but the virus is still surging in many countries and concerns are growing about global vaccine inequality.
Ireland on Monday lifted domestic travel restrictions and began a phased reopening of non-essential retailers, while Greece opened nursery, elementary and middle schools.
Cinemas are also expected to reopen, as well as some large indoor venues after the government held several pilot events -- including a rock concert -- to test safety measures.
- Act 'responsibly' -
"The end of the state of emergency does not mean the end of restrictions. Far from it. The virus threat still exists," Justice Minister Juan Carlos Campo wrote in an opinion piece in El Pais, urging Spaniards to behave "responsibly."
And in Germany, people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 were exempt from many restrictions from Sunday after the government passed new legislation.
But in Norway, an expert government committee recommended that the country drop the Johnson & Johnson and the AstraZeneca jabs over the risks of rare but serious side effects.
- India variant worries -
The devastating wave has overwhelmed India's healthcare system, and experts have said official figures for cases and fatalities are much lower than the actual numbers.
The situation in India has been worsened by a new more contagious variant and there are fears it could potentially dodge some vaccine protections, World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told AFP on Saturday.
Underscoring the gravity of the Indian outbreak, an Australian court on Monday kept in place a contentious ban on citizens returning home from the country.
And China plans to set up a "separation line" on the summit of Mount Everest -- which straddles the China-Nepal border -- to avoid possible infections by climbers from Nepal, where dozens have been taken ill at base camp, state media reported.
The world got a glimpse of post-pandemic life as Tokyo hosted a test event ahead of the Summer Olympic Games.
"It's weird running in a stadium with no fans," US sprinter Justin Gatlin said after winning the men's 100m.
The United States remains the worst-hit nation in the world, with the highest number of known fatalities and infections.
The United States was battered by the pandemic, but since January new infections have come down as more than 114 million people have been fully vaccinated.

A swimming star is the first Olympian to receive one of her two COVID-19 injections as the AOC rejects claims athletes pushed in the line.
A relieved Cate Campbell can finally focus on winning an Olympic Games gold medal in Tokyo after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination in Brisbane on Monday.
Australia’s freestyle sprint queen admitted she panicked last week when she realised time was running out to get the first of two Pfizer vaccine jabs.
“When I saw the announcement came out, I was like `I need to get the vaccine in about a week’ and it was almost a week to the day since I had that thought and here I am (after) my first vaccination,” she said.
“I’m really glad that we can get it far enough away from the Olympics so that if there are any adverse side effects, we’ll be well and truly over them by the time it comes around to Olympic trials (next month).
“We are going into a pretty unknown situation over in Tokyo, so to have this little Band-Aid is a huge weight off everyone’s shoulders.”
While the vaccine isn’t compulsory for Australia’s Olympic and Paralympic contingent – set to total more than 2000 including officials — AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said it “provides comfort” for Olympians given the COVID concerns in Japan and rejected claims athletes have pushed in front of the queue.
“We’re not queue jumping,” he said.
“No one (in the public) is missing out, we’re running the vaccination process and we’re not putting the load on the public system whatsoever.”
Campbell was confident most, if not all, Olympians, would have the jabs.
“As far as I know everyone is putting up their had and saying ‘yes please and thank you’,” she said.
“The majority of competitors from first world countries will have had the vaccine as well, so we definitely want to even the playing fields as much we can with Brits and the Americans.
“No-one can guarantee anything. We’ve learnt that so much in the past year and a half, that this virus can change and mutate, and it’s up to us to play catch-up, by getting the vaccine, we’re getting on the front foot, which is really great.”
Campbell – who returned to Queensland in December with coach Simon Cusack after two years in NSW – said Australian athletes were fortunate to be able to prepare normally for the Olympics.
“The pandemic has impacted everyone, let’s not understate that but we are incredibly privileged in Australia to exist in a society where COVID doesn’t impact us on a daily basis,” she said.
“We still have access to all our training facilities, and everyone who we need to see. That’s been really helpful in preparing for these games.
“The rest of the world, the COVID situation that they’re dealing with, is much more dire than what we’re facing in Australia.”
As she prepares for her fourth Olympics, 28-year Campbell said she was better prepared than she was for the 2016 Rio Games.
“I have changed some mindsets going in, I’ve shaken up my training program, I’ve tried to keep a more balanced lifestyle, and I’m really looking forward to going in,” said Campbell, whose two Olympic gold medals have come in 4x100m freestyle relay events in Rio and nine years ago in London.
The Tokyo Olympic Games Opening ceremony will be held on July 23rd, 2021.

While no firm conclusion about the theories surrounding COVID-19 can be arrived at, available data is “fairly firmly in favour” of the virus coming from the lab at Wuhan, according to science writer and editor Nicholas Wade.

“In the Wuhan lab they were taking bat coronaviruses – that’s the same kind as the SARS-CoV-2 virus – and they were swapping in and out the spike protein from related coronaviruses,” he told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.

“They were trying to get a virus that was most infective for humans.”

The world is now “better prepared” to hear what research on COVID-19 early in the pandemic “clearly showed,” according to Flinders University Professor Nikolai Petrovsky.

His comments come following the revelations from a document produced by Chinese military scientists – in which they discuss weaponizing SARS coronaviruses.

Discussing the revelations with Sky News host Chris Kenny, Professor Petrovsky said the “pendulum has really swung back the other way”.

“Early on in this pandemic our research clearly showed there were a lot of unusual features about this virus,” he said.

“It was exquisitely human adapted from day one – that puzzled us enormously and raised questions how this virus came about.”

Australians who are vaccinated against COVID-19 could see some crucial benefits in terms of travel, the health minister says.
Vaccinated Australians could receive easier passage to and from the country in a plan aimed at incentivising immunisation, the health minister says.
A record 402,000 COVID-19 vaccines were administered across the nation last week, as the government faced pressure to reveal when the international border closure will end.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the prospect of reopening should compel Australians to get immunised, but warned the border would open incrementally over time.
“It should certainly be an incentive to get vaccination,” he told reporters on Monday.
“What we are also looking at with regards to the opening of borders is that progressive capacity, based on medical advice for those that have been vaccinated to have easier passage out and easier passage in,” he said.
In April, Mr Hunt said even a 100 per cent vaccination rate was “no guarantee” of the border reopening.
“(It) is based on a series of factors … If the whole country were vaccinated, you couldn’t just open the borders,” he said.
Vaccines were highly effective at reducing serious symptoms caused by COVID-19, Mr Hunt said, but key to the reopening decision would be their effectiveness at stopping transmission of the virus.
Mr Hunt also confirmed the government would respond “in full” to the Royal Commission into Aged Care, which delivered 148 recommendations in a final report in March.
The health minister would not “pre-empt” the announcement, but said it would prove to be a “line in the sand” for the sector.
“It will be a record investment in aged care and will also be a record response to any royal commission in Australian history,” he said.
“Not only is it about investment, but it is about the deep and profound respect for older Australians.
“If we can produce not only the support but also respect and care and dignity, then I think we will have achieved something.”
The government in 2019 received a damning interim report from the Royal Commission titled ‘Neglect’, outlining the “cruel and harmful” system awaiting Australians in their old age.
When the final report was handed down, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government’s response would be detailed in the budget.
But Labor leader Anthony Albanese on Monday accused the Coalition of “sitting around” in the interim, saying it “waits around until there’s a crisis” before responding.
“This government has sat on eight years of neglect,” Mr Albanese said.
“This government also cut funding for aged care, directly by Scott Morrison, and hasn’t put that money back in spite of the interim report of the Royal Commission. So this is a real test.”

An independent COVID survey will check the pulse of residents 12 months on from the start of the pandemic in Mackay.
The COVID-19 Community Pulse Survey will provide a snapshot of how the Mackay community is faring compared to 12 months ago.
The survey, to start on Monday May 10, is a year on from the one Mackay Regional Council commissioned in May last year to gauge the impact of COVID-19.
Results from this new survey will be benchmarked against the original to provide a clear picture of how residents are faring.
Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson said the first review found one-third of Mackay region residents reported their employment had been negatively impacted.
He said this included reduced hours, being stood down or difficulty finding work.
“At that time most residents were hopeful for the future. However, one in three felt at risk of their situation worsening in the next six months,” Cr Williamson said.
He said while certain sectors were still doing it tough due to COVID, Mackay had largely been shielded from major impacts.
“Our big employers, such as the mining and mining support industries and sugar, have kept rolling on,’’ Cr Williamson said.
“Hopefully, this new survey will show improvement in negative COVID impacts and residents’ thoughts on the future.
“COVID is still impacting our daily lives, including travel, and Mackay residents were mandated to wear masks during a recent Brisbane lockdown.
“It isn’t going away anytime soon, and this new survey will provide a good snapshot of any immediate and future concerns, compared to a year ago.”
The survey will include a random phone poll of residents, as well as the option for people to respond online.
IRIS Research will undertake the work on behalf of the council.
The company has conducted community attitude surveys for the council dating back to 2009, as well as the first COVID-19 community pulse survey 12 months ago.
IRIS Research will be calling Mackay mobile phones and landlines to conduct the phone survey.
The callers will clearly identify that they are calling from IRIS Research on behalf of the council.

The NSW chief health officer has issued a grim warning about Sydney’s ‘missing link’, saying the virus could be spreading in secret.
Health officials are still racing to work out how a Sydney man caught COVID-19 amid concerns there are chains of transmission that continue to go “unrecognised” in the city.
“(The local case’s) contact with the infectious person must have been very fleeting,” chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant told reporters on Monday.
“We are concerned there are chains of transmission in the community that are unrecognised.
“We’re not out of the risk period.”
Dr Chant said the missing link between a returned US traveller and the man, from Sydney’s eastern suburbs, had still not been found as of Monday morning.
The man in his 50s and his wife tested positive to COVID-19 last week.
Neither have links with hotel quarantine, border control or healthcare, sparking concerns about how he caught the disease.
Health officials fear someone may have been unknowingly infectious may be going about their business in the community.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian agreed the man’s contact with an infected person must have been brief.
She said authorities have combed CCTV and spoken to “lots of people” to try and determine how he caught it, with the man even detailing the roads he had walked along to contact tracers.
“The concern is, if it’s one or multiple people, who are those missing links it was a very fleeting meeting,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters.
“That suggests there could be a high level of contagion.”
Meanwhile, lines are already forming at a mass vaccination hub in Sydney’s west as the government ramps up its jab rollout.
Located at Sydney Olympic Park, the hub will administer 30,000 doses a week in a bid to double the number of jabs distributed across NSW each week.
It will operate 12 hours a day and is staffed by more than 300 healthcare workers.
Restrictions were due to lift across NSW on Monday, but will stay in place for at least another week in the hopes of finding the ‘missing link’ before the small outbreak spreads further.
The only restriction to ease on Monday is the mandatory wearing of masks in retail settings, but workers will still be required to wear them for at least another week.
While official numbers will be revealed at 11am, it’s very likely there are no new cases of COVID-19 recorded in NSW on Monday.
Younger Victorians will soon be able to get a coveted coronavirus jab once exclusively meant for health workers and the elderly.

The global threat of COVID-19 has left scientists around the world scurrying for new solutions. But this may be the strangest yet.
The imminent threat posed by COVID-19 has seen a wide range of left-field solutions emerge out of labs over the past year as scientists scurry to stem the spread of the unprecedented pandemic.
In February, scientists at the US’ University of South Carolina developed an artificial intelligence capable of generating vaccine designs in mere seconds, a process which has historically taken years to carry out by teams of researchers.
The demand for fast and reliable testing remains stronger than ever as infection rates continue to soar around the globe, prompting a number of alternatives to the traditional PCR test. In July 2020, a team of researchers for BMC Infectious Diseases revealed dogs could be used to detect coronavirus in patients at a success rate of 94 per cent.
Now, scientists in the Netherlands have found another way to detect coronavirus: bees.
The benefits bees bring to the global ecosystem are already well-documented, but now it appears the world’s one and only suppliers of honey have added a new skill to their resume.
Controlled tests using 150 bees at the biosafety laboratory of Wageningen Bioveterinary Research revealed strong results. By using sugar water solution as a reward, scientists were able to train the bees to detect positive samples of coronavirus collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected minks.
After a lengthy training period, the bees were able to detect coronavirus in samples collected from humans.
“The bees extended their tongues to collect the sugar water solution. By repeating this action several times, the bees associated the sugar reward with the scent as the stimulus,” the report stated.
“With this repeated conditioning, soon enough bees started extending their tongues out for the scent alone, with no reward offered as a follow-up.”
According to InsectSense, Bees have extremely sensitive olfactory receptors that can sense volatile compounds in the range of parts per billion to even parts per trillion. This ability makes them ideal for detection of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) that might be present in the environment in extremely low quantities.
Researchers have already developed prototypes of a new machine, “BeeSense”, which can automatically train large amounts of bees simultaneously, including a biosensor that deploys the trained bees for diagnosis.
Scientists conducting the Wageningen study are confident the BeeSense could act an effective diagnostic system for developing countries with limited access to high-end technology.
“No one is saying they can replace a PCR machine, but they could be very promising,” veterinary neurologist Holger Volk told Nature.
Coincidentally, next Thursday (May 20) is World Bee Day, so don’t forget to raise a glass for the little buggers.

A returned traveller from India who tested positive to COVID-19 in hotel quarantine has been taken to ICU in Perth.
A man has been taken to a Perth intensive care unit after falling ill with COVID-19.
The Western Australian department of health said a man in his 30s who was in hotel quarantine was rushed to Fiona Stanley Hospital on Saturday.
He is a recently returned traveller from India. The man’s condition is said to be stable.
The nation of 1.3 billion is currently battling a huge surge in cases fuelled by a more contagious variant of the virus.

Customers at a busy Sydney Woolworths have been told to get tested and isolate immediately if they visited the store during a potential exposure time.
Health authorities have pleaded with shoppers who visited a Woolworths store in Sydney’s east during a COVID-19 exposure period to get tested and “isolate immediately” until a negative result is returned.
The major supermarket in Double Bay was added to the venues list as a site where people were potentially exposed to the virus.
Those at the store between 10.45am and 11am on Monday, May 3, are being considered as casual contacts to a known infection, NSW Health said on Saturday morning.
“NSW Health has identified a new venue of concern as part of ongoing investigations into the two locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported earlier this week,” the department wrote on Twitter.
“Anyone who attended the following venue at the time listed below is considered a casual contact and should get tested immediately and isolate until a negative result is received. Continue to monitor for symptoms, and if they appear, get tested again.”
RELATED: NSW records no new local cases
The update comes as health authorities reported zero new locally acquired cases on Saturday, with six returned overseas travellers testing positive in quarantine.
There were fears that a lockdown would be implemented over the Mother’s Day weekend after a couple in their 50s contracted the virus, with tracers unable to pinpoint how they became infected.
A man in his 50s from Sydney’s eastern suburbs tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, and contact tracing alerts from the case now cover more than a dozen suburbs across the city.
Genome sequencing has linked the man’s case to a returned traveller from the US, who had an Indian variant of the virus, but it is not yet known how the virus spread between them.
The man’s wife had also tested positive to the virus with Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday praising the man’s use of QR codes to accurately record his movements.
“This person did everything right, but it goes to show that we can't take a single thing for granted,” she told reporters during the week.
“It goes to show we have to maintain our social distancing, have to make sure we have good hand hygiene, we need to get tested with the mildest of symptoms, and very importantly and significantly, we need to use QR codes.”
Anyone who visited the following venues at the specified times are considered close contacts and should get tested immediately, and isolate for 14 days regardless of result:
BONDI JUNCTION: Screening of The Courier at Event Cinemas, Friday April 30; 6:00pm to 8:00pm
COLLAROY: Alfresco Emporium, 1021 Pittwater Rd, Tuesday May 4; 1:00pm to 1:30pm

NSW Health has revealed six overseas travellers who reported being fully vaccinated have tested positive to COVID-19 in hotel quarantine.
Six overseas travellers who reported they were fully vaccinated have tested positive for COVID-19 while in hotel quarantine, authorities have revealed.
The numbers were released in this week’s NSW Health COVID-19 surveillance report as the federal government pushes forward with its vaccine passport plans.
The report states six people in the NSW hotel quarantine system tested positive over four weeks ending on May 1, despite reporting they were vaccinated prior to landing in Australia.
The figures raise concerns about the prospects of a vaccine passport system as Scott Morrison comes under increasing pressure to repatriate Australians stranded overseas.
NSW Health noted all six may have contracted the potentially deadly virus prior to their vaccination becoming fully effective.
The report stated a dose does not become fully effective until two weeks after the patient receives the second of a two-dose vaccine.
According to federal government figures 2.5 million Australians have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
But the government has received criticism for its slow roll out, falling well below its target of having four million adults given the jab by the end of March.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison this week said his government was working on a prospective vaccine passport system, which would allow those with the jab to travel more freely.
He noted a condition of such a system would be proof that vaccines protect travellers against the transmission of the virus.
The success of the rollout will play a big part in any planned vaccine passport system, which would allow Australians to travel abroad.
China unveiled its digital passport system last month, with other countries including the United States announcing similar plans.
It would allow travellers to prove that they had been vaccinated in order to enter another country.
“I think (a vaccine passport) is the next step, but I do think that next step is some way away,” Mr Morrison told 3AW.
“If you’re fully vaccinated, you would be able to travel, certainly around Australia, but maybe overseas, without the need for hotel quarantine.”
The report also reveals that 89 of the 180 cases came from overseas travellers arriving from India, followed by the United States (15) and Bangladesh.
India has been racked by the virus, prompting the government to ban anyone from travelling to Australia if they had been to India in the previous fortnight.
The ban will be lifted on May 15, Mr Morrison said.
He described the ban as a “pause” and said it would end on its intended date, with repatriation flights to begin after that.
They are currently 9000 Australians in India who want to come home, including 173 children who are in the country without their parents, a Senate committee heard this week.

Zero new cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in NSW as contact tracers continue to investigate how a couple contracted the virus earlier this week.
New South Wales has recorded zero new locally acquired cases of COVID-19, scuppering fears of a Mother’s Day lockdown.
Six returned overseas passengers in hotel quarantine tested positive among 22,153 tests in the 24-hour reporting period, NSW Health said on Saturday.
Despite the positive news of no community transmission, mystery still surrounds a couple who contracted the virus this week.
There were fears a lockdown would be implemented over the Mother’s Day weekend after the couple in their 50s tested positive, with tracers unable to pinpoint how they became infected.

It is known a returned traveller in hotel quarantine somehow passed the virus on to the couple, but authorities are yet to identify the missing link between them.
The cases prompted the NSW government to introduce a raft of mandatory health restrictions including face masks in shopping centres and on public transport.
But Sydneysiders have been urged to continue going about their daily lives while taking heed of precautions.
The following rules are in force for Greater Sydney, Wollongong and the Blue Mountains until 12.01am on Monday.
*No more than 20 people allowed inside a home.
*No singing or dancing in indoor venues, including places of worship and entertainment venues (with the exception of weddings).
*Masks are compulsory at all indoor venues, including public transport.
*Only two visitors allowed per resident in aged care facilities.
*Drinking while standing up at indoor venues is not be allowed
In an attempt to stem potential outbreaks, NSW Health on Saturday issued an alert for anyone who visited the Double Bay Woolworths on Kiaora Road between 10.45am and 11am on Monday, May 3.
Anyone who visited the supermarket at that time is considered a casual contact and has been asked to get tested immediately and self isolate until they receive a negative result.

The daughter of an Aussie resident who died of COVID-19 in India has hit out at the PM saying she’s “angry” and disappointed to be Australian.
The daughter of an Australian permanent resident who died in India after reportedly contracting COVID-19 has hit out in an open letter addressed to Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Sydney woman Sonali Ralhan, who’s father died in Delhi on Wednesday age 59, says her father was “abandoned”.
“I write to you with so much anger brewing inside me,” Ms Ralhan wrote on Facebook.
“I am an Australian citizen and highly disappointed to be one today.
“What nation disowns their own citizens? (It) is a matter of wonder for the entire world.”
Ms Ralhan contacted embassy officials in India a few weeks ago with “great hopes” that her parents, long-term residents of Australia, would be brought home, reports Seven News.
His death came three days after the federal government’s travel ban, making it temporarily illegal for Australian citizens and permanent residents to return home from the COVID-raddled country.
On Friday afternoon, Marise Payne told 2GB’s Jim Wilson from Geneva: “Certainly extend my sympathy and that of the government to the family of this person and to so many families that we know are dealing with what is an extraordinary challenge. with infection rates surging at over 400,00 infections a day at the moment in India”.
Senator Payne later said the the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was providing consular assistance to the family but they were unable to confirm the circumstances of the man’s death.

Sonali Ralhan said in a Facebook post Thursday night that her mother was still stuck in India.
“It is with a very heavy heart and pain I need to inform you that my father has left us,” she posted.
“Now all I have left is my mother, who has been abandoned by her own government of Australia.
“We all want to cry our hearts out, but we are saving them for when we are all together again.”
Meanwhile Prime Minister Scott Morrison overnight “thanked” his friend, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after a phone call between the two leaders where Australia confirmed more medical supplies were on their way.
“We’re supporting them with ventilators and oxygen concentrators. We won’t forget India’s generosity in exporting vaccines,” Mr Morrison posted.
Just spoke with our friend, PM @narendramodi who thanked Australia for standing by India during the #COVID19 crisis. Weâre supporting them with ventilators and oxygen concentrators. We wonât forget Indiaâs generosity in exporting vaccines. Weâll work closely on global challenges.
Spoke with my friend @ScottMorrisonMP to thank him for Australiaâs solidarity and support for Indiaâs fight against the pandemic.We agreed on the importance of ensuring affordable and equitable access to vaccines and medicines, and discussed possible initiatives in this regard.
High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell was asked at a senate committee hearing on Friday whether he was aware of any Australians who had died of COVID-19 in India while waiting to come home.
“The department is aware and providing consular assistance, in accordance with its charter, to the family of an Australian permanent resident who reportedly has died in India,” he said.
“I’m advised, owing to our privacy obligations, we won’t be providing any further comment.”
Mr O’Farrell went on to explain that India had been reporting a nightly infection rate that was “greater than the population of Canberra” and he didn’t believe “anyone can put hand on heart” and say that Australian citizens or permanent residents were not among the deaths.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne described India as the “most significant hotspot” in the world but would not elaborate on the Australian’s death.
“I don’t think it’s helpful to speculate and particularly out of respect for the family,” she said.
“I will receive further advice from our posts in India in relation to that, but most importantly let me extend my sympathy, and that of the government, to the family of this person.”
Earlier it was revealed three Australian states were likely to receive rescue flights from India once a travel ban on the COVID-ravaged country ends this month, but stranded Australians who test positive to the virus will not be on-board.
Mr Morrison revealed three government-chartered repatriation flights from India will arrive in India at the end of the travel ban or by the end of May.
The first flight to bring stranded Aussies home from India is on its way, and there’s also some much-needed relief on board.

Anthony Albanese has launched a fresh attack on Scott Morrison, accusing him of making a critical mistake in Australia’s response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Scott Morrison’s failure to act until there is a crisis is at the centre of an opposition attack on his leadership legacy.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese is attempting to seize on a fall in popular support for the Coalition amid the backdrop of a slow vaccine rollout and revelations about the treatment of women in parliament.
Ahead of the Coalition unveiling its pitch to voters in Tuesday’s federal budget, Mr Albanese has ramped up the fight over Australia’s COVID-19 recovery – a key election battleground.
“There is no forward thinking about where we are going to be in a year or two years,” Mr Albanese told NCA NewsWire.
“He (Scott Morrison) has a characteristic, which is he waits until there is a crisis before he responds at all, to anything.”
Mr Albanese blasted the Morrison government’s response to the black summer bushfires, as well as Australia’s quarantine system, adding the vaccine rollout had taken too long.
“It is hard to understand why he said Australia was at the front of the queue for vaccines when we quite clearly weren’t,” Mr Albanese said.
“If it’s all about marketing and spin, then you don’t have a strategic approach.”
Mr Albanese plans to prosecute the case for a Labor government by spruiking a platform of secure work, better jobs and skills, not leaving people behind, and addressing climate change.
Despite the ammunition, Mr Albanese acknowledged unseating the government would be a tough fight because incumbents had an advantage during a pandemic.
However, he said compared with state and territory leaders, Mr Morrison was “not very popular at all”.
“Our primary vote is up substantially, our two-party preferred is back up, and we are competitive,” Mr Albanese said.
Rusted-on Labor supporters have accused the party of not being critical enough of the government during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
But Mr Albanese said he made no apologies for putting the national interest first, adding it was not “politics as usual”.
He hoped striking a balance between all-out attack and providing a constructive critique would be looked upon favourably by voters.
Mr Albanese said the government’s pledge to boost subsidies for parents with more than one kid in childcare, as well as their adoption of the JobKeeper wage subsidy, was proof Labor was setting the agenda from opposition.
Mr Albanese will use the opposition’s budget reply speech next week to outline new initiatives and reaffirm Labor’s pitch for a national reconstruction fund.
Asked if Labor would announce policies to help struggling first-home buyers enter the market, Mr Albanese said: “We will have more to say about housing policy, both in the weeks but also the months ahead.
“We have policies ready to roll out if the election was called tomorrow; we are ready.
“We will have a clear narrative going forward about a better, stronger, more inclusive Australia.”
Labor has committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but is yet to announce its midterm emissions reduction target.
If an election was called, Mr Albanese confirmed Labor would unveil its goal but said the United Nations Climate Change Conference at Glasgow in November was likely to change the debate.

We should not underestimate the number of people who have a vested interest in “keeping the madness” of COVID-19 going for “as long as possible,” says UNSW Economics Professor Gigi Foster.

“There are so many entrenched interests now,” she told Sky News host Chris Kenny.

Ms Foster said there are people, groups, organisations, businesses, and governments who have their “snouts in the trough” of COVID-19.

“That’s what we’re seeing,” she said.

“Someone like me, maybe someone like you, certainly many people who don’t have much skin in the game haven’t been making money hand over fist or haven’t been going up in power because of COVID, they might want to have things open as soon as possible for the benefit of themselves, their families, and even all of Australia. 

“But many business leaders, many people who are in particular positions of power where they’ve seen their power and their money just multiply during this period, do they want this rollercoaster ride to end? Of course not.

“That’s one of our big problems right now.”

Infectious Diseases Expert Professor Peter Collignon says the restrictions imposed in New South Wales so far have been “proportionate”.

No new locally acquired cases were recorded in the state, however some restrictions remain in place including a mask mandate on all indoor venues as well as restrictions on household gatherings across Greater Sydney.

Speaking on the restrictions, Professor Collignon said they have not been “overreactive”.

“We do actually need to try and see if we can work out where this thing is coming from,” he told Sky News host Chris Kenny.

“Because these cases that occur in the community and you don’t know where they’re coming from, they’re the ones that are the most dangerous.”

India’s official virus death toll has come under scrutiny as obituaries in an Indian newspaper suggest the real figure could be much worse.
Obituaries in an Indian newspaper reveal the country’s death toll could be much worse than official government statistics indicate.
A day after India set new global records for daily deaths and infections from COVID-19 with more than 4000 lives lost and 412,000 new infections, a report shows why rumours about an alleged cover-up continue to spread.
The Washington Postlooked through obituaries in a local newspaper in the western city of Rajkot for a single day in April and found there were more than 240 death notices for people who had died from COVID-19.
That figure is in stark contrast to an official government figure from Rajkot and its surrounding district which showed just 12 deaths on that day.
The Post claims crematorium statistics from three randomly selected cities showed “a wide divergence from official tallies” and “appeared to capture only a fraction of COVID-19 deaths”.

Crematoriums working day and night
News.com.au previously reported on the discrepancy between bodies and the government’s official death toll. In Lucknow, at a COVID-only crematorium, double the number of bodies arrived on six different days in April compared to government data.
“We are working day and night,” an employee said. “The incinerators are running full-time but still many people have to wait with the bodies for the last rites.”
Harvard epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding last week called the situation “extremely worrisome”.
“Deaths being suppressed,” he wrote. “At the two crematoriums in Bhopal, 187 bodies were cremated following COVID protocols in four days – all while official death toll remained at just five.”
A journalist in New Delhi earlier this week told news.com.au he is seeing “absolute carnage” and scenes that resemble a “world war-like situation” with “dead bodies everywhere”.
Tahir Ibn Manzoor said he was shocked by what he was seeing.
“It is a warlike situation where you see bodies piled up. Some are rotting with their relatives and family members waiting for hours in the crematorium grounds which are usually cramped for space with furnaces burning round the clock.”
The concerns over India’s actual death toll come as shocking statistics reveal the toll COVID-19 has had on other parts of the country.

Poverty adding to severity of crisis
A new study shows around 230 million Indians fell into poverty due to the pandemic last year with young people and women the hardest hit, and the current second wave threatens to make matters even worse.
India’s stringent months-long lockdown from last March put around 100 million people out of work, the report by the Bangalore-based Azim Premji University said, with around 15 per cent unable to find jobs even by the end of the year.
Women fared worst in that group, with a staggering 47 per cent of female workers unable to secure employment even after virus restrictions were lifted, according to the study published on Wednesday.
The report, which defined people in poverty as those living on less than 375 rupees ($5) per day, said: “Though incomes fell across the board, the pandemic has taken a far heavier toll on poorer households.”
Asia’s third-largest economy was in the throes of a prolonged slowdown even before COVID-19 struck, but the pandemic unravelled years of gains.
An estimated 50 million Indians were expected to climb out of poverty last year; instead the poorest 20 per cent of households saw their entire income vanish in April and May as business ground to a halt.
“Needless to say, the second wave is going to make things worse,” said Amit Basole, one of the report’s authors.
Many families coped with the income losses by spending less on food and taking on debt, with an alarming 20 per cent of respondents revealing that their food intake had not improved even six months later.

Pop praises ‘tireless work’ amid India’s second wave
Last year’s lockdown sparked a huge exodus of millions of migrant workers who headed home to their villages, with many planning to return after the economy reopened for business.
But one in three people aged under 25 failed to find work even by the end of the year after losing jobs in the lockdown, the study said.
As a vicious second virus wave overwhelms hospitals and triggers fresh curbs on economic activity in most of the country, millions of Indians whose lives are already precarious are likely to see their condition worsen.
The situation has concerned Pope Francis who on Thursday hailed the “tireless” work of medics in India and urged them to stay strong in a message of support for the coronavirus-plagued country.
In a message to the Catholic Bishops’ Conference in India, the pontiff offered his “heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people”.
“My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,” he said.
“I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters.
“With deep appreciation I invoke upon all of them God’s gifts of perseverance, strength and peace.”

Jeremy and Tabitha have made a killing out of a really simple concept, but they joke they are on a mission to save marriages.
A simple idea to create flat pack desks that require no screws or allen keys has seen new business IsoKing rake in a “mind blowing” $3.6 million in revenue in just 12 months.
“We had the goal of $1 million in the first year and we blew that away in only 50 days,” co-founder Jeremy Fleming told news.com.au.
But IsoKing was born out of a mad necessity to save the event staging company, Stagekings, that he had created six years ago with wife Tabitha. Business was booming as they created sets for the likes of Ninja Warrior, the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony and at Edinburgh Castle for the Military Tattoo.
But when it was announced Australia was going into a national lockdown in March, they saw the loss of millions of dollars of work overnight.
“We faced a real prospect of losing everything, it’s a family owned business, and we talked about how realistically we were looking at losing the house and everything – it was a horrible time,” he said.
“We had to tell all the staff we had no work for them and one week later we sent them home. It was an extremely stressful time.”
But drawing on their head of design Mick Jessop’s hobby in designing furniture – who had also 3D printed his house – Mr Fleming decided to tap into the hoards of people working from home. He tasked Mr Jessop with creating a flat pack desk, which they planned to deliver on the way home from their warehouse.
RELATED: Aussie woman’s ‘quirky’ $1.5M shoe empire
A post he put out on social media about making the desks to help them “keep the lights on” changed everything. It went viral, after being shared by thousands of people and seen by millions. In a matter of days they were selling hundreds of desks and pulling in event workers who had also had their jobs decimated by the pandemic.
Over the past year, IsoKing has sold 35,000 desks, with a number of different designs ranging in price from $249 to $549, while making other requests such as shoe and wine racks, hat towers and scooter and surfboard racks.
The 43-year-old, who has three children aged 11, 9 and 6 with Tabitha, credits the success to incredible timing.
“We moved really quickly and it was around the same time public gathering bans were put in place and whole industries were having to work from home and Officeworks were sold out and Ikea had no desks,” he explained.
“Chinese manufacturers were saying 18 to 20 week lead time for a desk and it was all to do with the story too. People really connected with the story and appreciated we were having a go and because we were delivering the next day that also helped.”
Stagekings made a roaring comeback in March with a lot of film production, TV work and corporate events keeping them busy.
There’s also been requests for the company to do supermarket fit-outs, pop up stores and more commercial work on the back of IsoKing, he added.
RELATED: Aussie brand’s $8m from grocery staple
It meant a crossroads on whether they should continue with IsoKing. But with requests for bedframes and bookcases, they wanted to take it even further, and have just launched a new range of furniture with six pieces.
All pieces are made using locally sourced sustainable birch ply, and stay true to the brand’s sleek scandi style, with easy, no tools assembly.
It’s called the Florence range, in a nod to the first stage they built for the event business, which was for the rock band Florence and the Machine.
It includes a single bedframe for $1590 and a queen size one which costs $2190, while a bedside table will set you back $325. There’s also a coffee table for $1050 and an entertainment unit retailing at $1350.
The cheapest bit of furniture in the range is a side table for $290, while the bookcase is the most expensive piece selling for $2590.
“We get so much feedback that people hate allen keys and since the very beginning that was some of the biggest feedback, how simply the desk all goes together, and that was the aim with this range,” he said.
“I joke we are trying to look after marriages as I’ve heard so many stories about people fighting over Ikea furniture.”
The future for IsoKing is to have a range that would fill up a two-bedroom apartment, revealed Mr Fleming.
“We want to have a whole range that people can put in the back of a ute or van and build in their apartment in 10 or 15 minutes, as well as really designer looking stuff,” he said. “We want to make simple, efficient systems and ranges, particularly for people that continually move around, so that’s mostly those younger uni people.”
Based in Sydney, Mr Fleming also wants to take IsoKing global and has a goal to become the next Koala Furniture.
“The big dream is that we have a really strong e-commerce furniture business. We kind of compare ourselves to Koala in a way. They have now moved overseas and we have had a lot of inquires from the US, so we are looking at exporting so we have very big plans,” he said.
“Other people have said we are the next Ikea and it’s kinda ridiculous, but it’s funny.”

An 11am update will reveal whether Sydney’s outbreak has spread further – but the NSW Premier has already hinted it could be good news.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said she is “pleased” with the COVID-19 outbreak numbers that are expected to be presented at 11am.
The planned news conference will reveal whether Sydney’s coronavirus outbreak has spread further after an eastern suburbs couple tested positive and sent health officials on a wild scramble to map their movements.
But Ms Berejiklian has already given a hint as to what the day might bring. She gave interviews to two morning television shows on Friday.
“Obviously we give our updates 11am and suffice to say very I'm pleased with where things are at,” Ms Berejiklian told Channel 7’s Sunrise program.
“I’m pleased with the way the community has responded, I’m please with what (NSW) Health is doing.
“We’ll be able to confirm everything at 11am but suffice to say I am pleased with how the situation is unfolding.”
"I'm very pleased with where things are at and we'll be able to confirm everything at 11am" NSW Premier @GladysB hints that her state recorded low or no new community coronavirus cases on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/kdpXXARG5v
She said she preferred to wait to give a proper update until 11am because things might change before then.
NSW Health tallies coronavirus statistics by 24-hour periods that end at 8pm on the night before each announcement.
But sometimes when there have been community cases confirmed after that cut-off, authorities have announced them ahead of time.
Ms Berejiklian said despite the “pleasing” outcome, officials are still worried that there is at least one person in the community who has the virus and might be spreading it.
While officials have been able to figure out that the eastern suburbs couple were infected with the same virus as a returned traveller from the US, they don’t know who could have been the conduit between them.
The so-called missing link is one of the government’s greatest worries at the moment.
“It’s a mystery at the moment. We don't know who it is. It could be more than one person, it could be a worker that has passed it onto someone else, who has passed it onto someone else,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Health authorities have given themselves 72 hours to find the missing link between a man from the eastern suburbs in his 50s, diagnosed on Wednesday, and a returned traveller from the US before harsh restrictions imposed on the state in a bid to control the outbreak expire.
The new restrictions on bars, indoor gatherings and aged care facilities were brought in on Thursday afternoon, after the man and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus – marking the state’s first cases of local transmission in more than a month.
Residents were told they were required to adhere to the following public health guidelines until midnight on Monday:
Health officials have also added to a growing list of “venues of concern” where they believe people could have been exposed to the risk of the virus.

The man at the centre of a wild bubble tea brawl that went viral on the internet didn’t turn up to his first court appearance. This is why.
The man at the centre of the Adelaide bubble tea brawl, who was filmed allegedly slapping an employee in the face, was a no-show to his first court appearance after getting a COVID-19 test.
Lei Guo, who is also known as Gavin Guo, was arrested and charged with basic assault after footage of the violent tussle at FunTea in Adelaide’s CBD emerged on social media in early February.
The accused, 39, was bailed to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Friday but did not attend.
His lawyer produced a medical certificate and told the court that this client was self-isolating as he waited to receive results from a recent coronavirus test.
He asked for an adjournment as matters were “likely to resolve”.
Magistrate Simon Smart asked the police prosecutor if he should issue Mr Guo with a “non-appearance”.
“Under the circumstances, your honour, I don't think (so),” the prosecutor said.
Mr Guo’s lawyer made no comment as he left the court and did not elaborate on his vague comment about the matter resolving.
An Adelaide Chinese community representative Keith Jin sat in on the hearing as a spectator.
He later told reporters that the Chinese community was “very angry” about the situation.
“The whole community feels bad,” Mr Jin said.
The video – which is all in Mandarin – shows the victim, a female international student, first arguing with a man in a grey top.
A separate man in a black T-shirt begins arguing with the worker and then whacks the woman in the face, escalating the situation inside the Gouger Street business.
The footage shows the victim throwing what appears to be a black bag, which hits the light on the roof. She then yells at the man and starts to hit him back.
She is then kicked to the ground as others inside the business begin to tussle with each other.
Customers, including children, witnessed the brawl.
After the incident went viral on the internet, the FunTea owners taped a note to the store’s front window and denied claims the argument was over employees’ pay. They said it arose from a prior argument between the woman and Mr Guo, who was a customer.
“The management and owners of Fun Tea deplore violence of any sort, and have zero tolerance for assaults or violence,” the statement read.
It sparked the two female employees who were impacted by the wild brawl to speak out, issuing a public statement claiming they were victims of wage theft and earned between $10 and $12 an hour as casual employees when the legal minimum rate in a restaurant is $25.51.
A protest was later held out the front of the Chinatown store calling for an end to all wage exploitation and theft.
FunTea took to social media to announce on March 13 that the store was under new management.
Mr Guo is due to reappear in court in July.

The NSW government's response to another case of community transmission of the coronavirus is "proportional" and has a "likelihood" of getting control of the spread, according to Infectious Diseases Expert Professor Peter Collignon. 

"Well, I think they've adopted a proportional response to what the level of risk is at the moment. There is still one person we haven't found," he told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.

"But equally 80 per cent of people don't really transmit this to others. 

"Secondly, because they get the population on side and comply it decreases the chance of having a super spreading event because they're limiting indoor crowds- particularly without masks.

"And on top of that - so far the people in Sydney in all the past outbreaks have responded very well in getting testing when anybody has any symptoms - and they have been able to get control of this."

NRL clubs visiting and based in Sydney will be required to adhere to strict Level 3 Biosecurity Protocols from Friday afternoon.
The NRL will re-implement biosecurity protocols in response to Sydney’s recent case of community COVID-19 transmission.
From Friday afternoon, players are required to remain home unless training, exercising or shopping for essentials.
Players and staff must also adhere to restrictions reintroduced by the NSW government, including wearing face masks indoors.
In a statement released on Thursday evening, NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said he hopes the new restrictions would only be required for the short term.
Abdo remains hopeful all clubs will be able to travel interstate for Magic Round next week, which sees all 16 teams competing at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium rather than at stadiums across the east coast.
“These are strong measures to ensure our players remain healthy and the competition can proceed without interruption. We are hopeful Level 3 restrictions will only be implemented for a short time, but it is important to take this step as a safeguard measure, particularly with all clubs travelling to Brisbane (for Magic Round) next week,’’ Abdo said.
“The restrictions we have put in place also reduces the risk of a player attending a venue which may lead them to being identified as a close or casual contact.”
All Sydney clubs are subject to the new restrictions, as are the Melbourne Storm, who are in Sydney for their match against the Rabbitohs on Thursday night.
The Gold Coast Titans will play in Sydney on Saturday, and will also be required to abide by the restrictions during their time in the Harbour City.
As the new COVID-19 case visited a number of locations in the Eastern Suburbs, players and staff at the Sydney Roosters underwent COVID-19 tests on Thursday as a precaution. So far, none have tested positive.
The NRL has issued a stunning warning to clubs about head high contact ahead of Magic Round, as league boss Peter V’landys admitted the change should have come earlier.

India’s worsening catastrophe has reached new heights, with a record 412,262 new cases and 3980 deaths recorded and dashing hopes.
India saw record new jumps in COVID-19 cases and deaths on Thursday, dashing tentative hopes that the catastrophic recent surge was easing.
Health ministry numbers showed 3980 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the national total to 230,168, and 412,262 new cases, bringing India’s caseload since the pandemic began to 21.1 million.
Many experts suspect that with low levels of testing and poor record-keeping for cause of death — and crematoriums overwhelmed in many places — the real numbers could be significantly higher.
The rise follows several days of falling case numbers that had raised government hopes that the virus surge may have been easing.
Having hit a high of 402,000 last Friday, the daily number of coronavirus cases eased to 357,000 before creeping up again on Tuesday.
RELATED: Worst thing about India’s horror show
Senior health ministry official Lav Aggarwal had told reporters on Monday that there was a “very early signal of movement in the positive direction”.
The sharp rise in cases since late March has overwhelmed hospitals in many places, with fatal shortages of beds, drugs and oxygen.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has resisted imposing a new lockdown although several regions including the capital New Delhi, Bihar and Maharashtra have imposed local shutdowns.
Until now the worst-hit areas have been Delhi and Maharashtra but other states including West Bengal, Kerala and Karnataka are now reporting sharp rises.

K. Vijay Raghavan, the Indian government’s principal scientific advisor, said on Wednesday that the country of 1.3 billion had to be ready for another wave of infections after the current one.
“Phase 3 is inevitable given the high levels of circulating virus. But it is not clear on what timescale this phase 3 will occur. We should prepare for new waves,” Mr Raghavan told a news conference.
With the government facing criticism as patients die outside hospitals, consignments of oxygen and equipment have been arriving from the United States, France, Britain, Russia and other countries in recent days.
But India will need yet more oxygen from other countries to fight the surge until numbers stabilise, another government official said Monday.
RELATED: Viral picture reveals India’s nightmare
“We did not and do not have enough oxygen,” the top government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “If we could get more oxygen more lives would be saved.”
Overnight, 11 people died in a hospital near the southern city of Chennai after pressure dropped in oxygen lines, the Times of India reported on Thursday, the latest in a string of similar incidents.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has called for “urgent” international action to prevent “a worsening human catastrophe” across South Asia.
It highlighted the case of Nepal, where it said “many hospitals are full and overflowing” with COVID-19 patients and the daily caseload is 57 times higher than one month ago.
The National Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday meanwhile that the UK strain of COVID-19 was more dominant in north India, while the new Indian variant known as B.1.617 was more prevalent in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat, reports said.
The first flight to bring stranded Aussies home from India is on its way, and there’s also some much-needed relief on board.

The AFL has amended the start times of two round eight matches in response to an outbreak of COVID-19 in Sydney this week.
The AFL has altered the start times of two round eight games less than two days before their first bounces,
In response to a recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Sydney, the AFL has moved the starting time of Essendon’s match with GWS from 1.45pm AEST to 2.10pm AEST this Saturday.
The match will remain at Giants Stadium as planned despite speculation it could have been moved to GWS’ interstate home of Canberra.
According to a statement from the AFL, the change will ensure Essendon has enough time to travel to and from NSW by chartered flight on game day.
As a result, the game between St Kilda and Gold Coast has been pushed forward from 2.10pm AEST to 1.45pm AEST.
All other fixtures, including the match between the Sydney Swans and the Melbourne Demons, remain unchanged.
On Thursday, the Swans were granted permission to enter Melbourne for their clash with the Demons after all players and staff members tested negative to coronavirus this week.
The club will charter a flight to Melbourne on Thursday evening and has been told to prepare for a longer stay than normal.
Sydney’s VFL side are remaining behind and will play their match against the Casey Demons at a later date.
“The club will continue to closely monitor the COVID situation and be led by the AFL and NSW government,” the Swans said in a statement on Thursday.
“The safety of everyone in our programs and the wider community remains paramount.”
Earlier on Thursday, Essendon was told its match with GWS could be shifted to Canberra as a result of Sydney’s COVID scare.
Coach Ben Rutten said he and the club wanted to know by Thursday night at the latest despite declaring the experiences of 2020 meant his players could adapt to anything.
On Wednesday, the NSW government confirmed one person in the state had tested positive to COVID-19, forcing a number of hot spots to be declared and players from GWS and Sydney forced to undertake tests ahead of their Round 8 fixtures.
On Thursday morning, Rutten said he and the players were still waiting on confirmation of the impact of any changes.
“We are aware there may be some changes but we are still waiting to see what that looks like,” he said.
“There’s a few different scenarios … we can’t plan for too much. We will wait and see what we are doing.
“Guys are pretty accepting of it now. We knew coming into the year it was going to be a different looking year on the back of last year.
“We need to know by tonight what’s happening. Our plan is to travel up there tomorrow, but that may change.
“We did it (fly in, fly out on game day) a bit last year, that’s not uncommon now.”
GWS players have Thursday off but were briefed about the outbreak on Wednesday.
All players and club staff were told to get tested, with the last of those taking place on Thursday morning.
No Giant was at any of the government-listed exposure sites.
The AFL already moved Fremantle’s clash with Brisbane to the Gabba for this weekend, flipping a game later in the season.
The Dockers will remain on the Gold Coast for the next fortnight, flying to Essendon in Round 9.
The AFL has unveiled the fixture for rounds 13-15 of the 2021 season, which is set to include three Thursday night blockbusters.

New Zealand will put a pause on all flights out of Sydney, amid NSW reporting two locally acquired cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
On Thursday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian revealed the wife of a man in his 50s, who found out he was infected on Wednesday, tested positive to the virus as well.
In response, Ms Berejiklian announced a slate of new restrictions in greater Sydney over the next three days to minimise the chances of further cases spreading,
New Zealand health officials wasted no time announcing restrictions against some of NSW, just weeks after both nations opened the trans-Tasman travel bubble.

The travel bubble across the ditch launched on April 19, after more than a year of travel bans in place between both countries.
Queensland have also rapidly brought in restrictions against Greater Sydney, in a swift move to keep coronavirus out of its state.
Queensland Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said from 1am Friday, May 7, anyone arriving in the state who has been to any of the venues identified by NSW Health will need to go into hotel quarantine.
“We believe these are sensible restrictions at this time and, of course, we will be watching
and monitoring very closely what is happening in New South Wales,” Ms D’Ath said.
Following the announcement, many Queenslanders in Sydney reportedly immediately made plans to return home, even before the announcement was made.
Prime Minister Ardern’s advice to New Zealanders currently in NSW is to be vigilant around health messaging, record your movements and listen to updates and locations of interest.

New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said there is a possibility of a missing link between the two locally acquired COVID-19 cases and a US traveller in hotel quarantine who share the same virus strain. 

“The sequence from our new cases matched with the overseas case who has travelled from the US and went to the Park Royal at Darling Harbour, the person was tested on day one and was positive and was moved to the SHA, the Sydney Health Accommodation, on the 28th [of May],” she said.

Dr Chant said NSW Health was “currently reviewing any CCTV footage to look at how transmission occurred” but said there was no direct link they had found.

“We can’t find any direct link between our case so what we’re concerned about is there another person that is yet unidentified that passed it onto our case.”

New South Wales has recorded just one new case of COVID-19 – the wife of the Sydney man who tested positive on Wednesday.

“The balance of his close contact are negative. So whilst, of course, we remain on high alert, pleasingly, at this stage, nobody else has been identified as being a positive case,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. 

“But we know that the incubation period of this virus is 14 days and everybody has to be on high alert moving forward, especially over the next few days.”

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/breaking-news/source-of-sydney-covid19-infection-revealed-as-virus-spreads-to-mans-wife/news-story/7cbc44f9f703ab35c06c0d30d8cefe61
NSW health officials have revealed how a Sydney man was infected with COVID as his wife tests positive to the illness as well.
NSW Health officials have said they know who carried the coronavirus that infected a Sydney man but worry there is a “missing link” who is also positive.
The news came after the wife of the eastern suburbs man in his 50s, who found out he was infected on Wednesday, tested positive to the virus as well.
The couple were the first two confirmed local cases of coronavirus in NSW in over a month.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said “health detectives” had managed to trace the source of the man’s infection.
Genome analysis revealed the likely source of the man’s infection was a person who arrived from the US and attended special health accommodation after testing positive upon arrival in Australia.
But it’s still not clear how the virus managed to spread from that person to the eastern suburbs man who was confirmed positive on Wednesday.
“We can’t find any direct link between our (cases),” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“So what we’re concerned about is that there is another person that is yet to be identified that infected our case.”
Dr Chant said the health department believed the virus strain originated in India.
However, it was not currently considered a “variant of concern”, the term the department uses for certain highly transmissible versions of the coronavirus such as those that originated in the UK and South Africa.
The man visited a number of venues in Sydney before he realised he was infected, including a CBD restaurant where NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet was having coffee at the same time.
Mr Perrottet has tested negative for the virus but will remain in self-isolation for 14 days starting last Friday.
The fears of continued community spread prompted Ms Berejiklian to announce a raft of new restrictions for greater Sydney.
Residents will be required to adhere to the following public health guidelines from 5pm on Thursday until midnight on Monday:
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the measures would only apply to people in the greater Sydney area – from the Central Coast, through to Sydney and down to the Illawarra.
“We believe this is a proportionate response to the risk ahead of us,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Virus fragments were discovered in a sewage network that services suburbs in Sydney’s inner west, NSW Health announced on Wednesday night.
The Marrickville Sewage Network handles waste from the suburbs of Marrickville, Dulwich Hill, Summer Hill, Lewisham, Ashfield, Haberfield, Petersham, Lilyfield and Leichhardt, home to some 42,000 people.
“NSW Health is asking everyone in these areas to be especially vigilant in monitoring for symptoms, and if they appear to get tested and isolate immediately until a negative result is received,” the department said.
It wasn’t clear whether there was any link to the infected couple and the fragments detected in the sewage.
There were 11,579 COVID-19 tests reported in NSW in the 24 hour period until 8pm on Wednesday night, about 2,000 fewer than the previous day.
Over 4400 vaccines were administered in the latest 24-hour reporting period, and the total figure for the state is 717,752.
There were nine new cases in hotel quarantine.
Strange objects in a suburban bathroom helped police arrest more than a dozen people allegedly involved in a major drug syndicate in two states.

The leader of one of the worst-hit countries on the planet has made extraordinary comments suggesting China created COVID-19.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has thrown out the rule book for dealing with China.
The far-right leader, who many have likened to former US president Donald Trump, calls it how he sees it – even if what he sees is, frankly, a bit out there.
On Wednesday, he continued his assault on Beijing with some wild claims about the origins of COVID-19 – a virus which has so far killed more than 400,000 people in Brazil and infected more than 14 million.
He said coronavirus may have been made in a laboratory to wage “biological warfare”.
“It’s a new virus. Nobody knows whether it was born in a laboratory or because a human ate some animal they shouldn’t have,” Mr Bolsonaro said.
“But the military knows all about chemical, biological and radiological warfare. Could we be fighting a new war? I wonder. Which country’s GDP has grown the most?”
He did not name China, but the country where the pandemic began was the only G20 economy to grow last year, notching a 2.3 per cent expansion.

Brazil’s GDP shrank 4.1 per cent and the United States’ GDP fell 3.5 per cent.
Mr Bolsonaro and his inner circle have a history of inflammatory comments on China that have sometimes aggravated relations with Brazil’s biggest trading partner.
In March, the President replaced former foreign minister Ernesto Araujo, who had denounced “Maoist China” and its plan for “world domination” with career diplomat Carlos Franca.
The move was widely seen as aimed at mending ties.
Bolsonaro’s comments not well received
But the theory that COVID-19 emerged in a virology lab in the city of Wuhan is a touchy subject for China which strongly denies the allegation.
A World Health Organisation report concluded in March that it was “extremely unlikely” the virus originated in a lab. However, WHO experts said they had encountered difficulties accessing raw data when they visited Wuhan.
Mr Bolsonaro’s comments were not received well inside Brazil. As CNN reported, Senator Omar Aziz, who is the president of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, said the inflammatory words were likely to complicate things further with China.

“Today was bad, you see, and it calls for chemical warfare and such,” he said.
Experts have written at length about the strained relationship between Brazil and China.
Washington-based think tank the Brookings Institution published an article last year detailing how Mr Bolsonaro’s strategy with China differed from that of previous leaders.
“Brazil is China’s most important economic and political partner in South America, as well as a key participant in the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) grouping of emerging powers that China increasingly leads,” the article reads.
“When it comes to global aspirations, China and Brazil have historically been in sync on their critiques of the liberal international order, if not on their preferred remedies.
“Since President Jair Bolsonaro assumed office in January 2019, this historical pattern has been up-ended. Bolsonaro and his foreign policy team have adopted a strongly pro-US (specifically pro-president Donald Trump) agenda internationally, including engaging in frequent critiques of China.

“Domestically, the partnership with China has been controversial with some sectors. Specifically, the partnership is criticised by the Brazilian manufacturing sector, which faces strong competition from Chinese products and lacks reciprocal access to Chinese market, and by nationalist-populist voters who support Bolsonaro.
“Agricultural export interests, by contrast, favour a strong relationship with Beijing because China is a major market for their products.”
China hits back at Brazil over criticism
The article highlighted how China had hit back at Brazil over its ongoing criticism.
“While initially restrained in response to criticism from the Bolsonaro administration, Chinese diplomats have struck back in 2020 in interviews and op-eds with local media. This confrontational dynamic is a marked departure from the historical trend in Brazil-China relations, which has trended toward deeper economic and political relations.
“China has a long-term interest in a close diplomatic relationship with Brazil, important both for its strategy in Latin America and maximising its global leadership. Beijing is unlikely to want this tension to become the ‘new normal’ in its relations with Brazil.
“In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bolsonaro administration has steered an erratic course between conciliatory rhetoric, seeking Chinese assistance against the novel coronavirus, and further criticism. Despite the preferences of its current foreign policy team, Brazil has important long-term strategic interests in maintaining a working partnership with China.”
China has not responded well to criticism from any country of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Australia’s calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus have led to an all-time low for Australia-China relations.

One of NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s top ministers has been forced to isolate after dining at the same restaurant as a positive COVID case.
The NSW Treasurer has been forced to self-isolate after learning he is a close contact of a positive COVID-19 case.
Dominic Perrottet returned a negative COVID-19 test but remained in isolation nonetheless, following his government’s guidelines.
Mr Perrottet dined at the same restaurant as a man in his 50s who tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.
They both visited the District Brasserie in Sydney’s CBD on Friday around lunchtime, though they were there separately.
Mr Perrottet told The Daily Telegraph that he was there for a cup of coffee with a friend.
He told the newspaper that he tried to check in using a QR code but realised later the scan hadn’t worked.
“We both scanned the QR code and I believed I’d completed the check-in, though it didn’t register,” he said.
“My friend notified me yesterday evening after seeing the public health advice, and I immediately completed a test and went into isolation. This was before either of us were contacted by NSW Health.”
Mr Perrottet was pictured on Monday alongside NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman and Planning Minister Rob Stokes at a funeral service in Manly.
The memorial for former premier Mike Baird‘s mother Judy was also attended by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Health Minister Brad Hazzard.
The latter two stood together at a press conference on Wednesday and announced the new community case.
The other funeral attendees would not be considered close contacts because unlike the Treasurer, they have not been physically close to an infected person.
The eastern suburbs man who tested positive on Wednesday morning attended several venues since April 30, the believed start date of his infectious period.
The man was at the District Brasserie at 2 Chifley Square between 11am and noon that day.
He also visited other venues across Sydney.
Because the man has no links to overseas travel, quarantine or health work, officials are so far stumped as to how he became infected.
Mr Perrottet, who has been treasurer since 2017, lives in his Epping electorate with his wife and six children.
He will continue to self-isolate for 14 days starting last Friday.

An Aussie politician has been caught up in a COVID-19 scare at an international summit in London, where diplomats took aim at China.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne has been caught up in a COVID-19 scare after two positive cases forced an Indian delegation into self-isolation during an international summit in London.
Ms Payne led an Australian delegation invited as a guest, alongside India, to G7 talks in London, where international leaders took aim at China over human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
But Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday revealed he had been exposed to possible COVID-19 cases and would not meet with fellow leaders in person.
“As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,” he tweeted.
Mr Jaishankar instead met with Ms Payne via videolink, saying the pair agreed to “further strengthen our many convergences” in the Indo-Pacific.

The summit had been touted as a major resumption of in-person diplomacy more than a year since the pandemic began.
But as India grapples the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak, including more than 400,000 cases on Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced to deny claims hosting the talks was premature.
“It’s very important to try to continue as much business as you as you can as a government,” he said.
“We have a very important relationship with India, with our G7 partners. As I understand it, what’s happened is that the individuals concerned are all, they’re all isolating now.”
Mr Johnson confirmed he would meet with India’s delegation via Zoom.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said measures, including daily testing of diplomats, had been imposed to ensure the summit was safe to proceed.
“Immediately (when) we saw those tests, they were in twice into self-isolation,” he said.
“(The measures) are working very effectively to isolate any conceivable potential risk in this case.”
Ms Payne was present as in-person talks went ahead without the Indian delegation, with diplomats separated by glass panels.
The Group of Seven took aim at China over crackdowns on pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong and Tibet and human rights abuses of the Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.
“We continue to be deeply concerned about human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang … especially the targeting of Uyghurs,” it said in a statement released shortly after the talks
“We strongly support independent and unfettered access to Xinjiang to investigate the situation on the ground.”
Beijing and Canberra have been locked in an escalating trade stoush for more than a year, seemingly prompted by Australia’s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 last April.
China has slapped a range of sanctions on Australian products, but the G7 pledged to resist Beijing’s “coercive” behaviour.
“We will work collectively to foster global economic resilience in the face of arbitrary, coercive economic policies and practices,” it said.
“We urge China to assume and fulfil obligations and responsibilities commensurate with its global economic role.”
The summit also focused on security in the Indo-Pacific, a fraught topic as China takes an increasingly assertive stance in the region.
The UK last week dispatched a massive naval fleet to the Indo-Pacific, while Australian politicians and public servants have raised the prospect of war in the region.
US President Joe Biden has also framed US-China relations as a battle “to win the 21st century”.
After her visit to Europe, Ms Payne will travel to Washington to meet representatives of the Biden administration.

A restaurant in Sydney’s CBD is the latest venue to be added to the COVID exposure list, alongside a second Westfield, after another NSW case.
A restaurant in Sydney’s city centre is the latest venue to be added to the state’s COVID hot spot list.
Anyone who was at XOPP in Haymarket, on the mezzanine level, between 1.30pm and 2.30pm on April 28 has been urged to get tested.
The alert comes after news broke the wife of the new case also tested positive to COVID-19.
Earlier a second Sydney Westfield was added to the venue exposure list.
Fratelli Fresh, in Westfield Sydney on Pitt Street was added on Thursday morning, with anyone who attended on April 27 between 1.15pm and 2.15pm advised to get a test immediately and isolate until further advice is given.
The same advice was also issued to patrons of Bondi Trattoria on Thursday April 29 from 12:45pm to 1:30pm.

A man in his 50s from Sydney’s eastern suburbs tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, and contact tracing alerts from the case now cover 14 suburbs across the city.
Genome sequencing has linked the man’s case to a returned traveller from the US, who had an Indian variant of the virus, but it is not yet known how the virus spread between them.
On Thursday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the man’s wife had also tested positive to the virus.
The Premier on Wednesday praised the man for using QR codes to record his movements, giving health officials crucial information to aid their detective work.
“This person did everything right, but it goes to show that we can't take a single thing for granted,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Wednesday.
“It goes to show we have to maintain our social distancing, have to make sure we have good hand hygiene, we need to get tested with the mildest of symptoms, and very importantly and significantly, we need to use QR codes.”
Anyone who visited the following venues at the specified times are considered close contacts and should get tested immediately, and isolate for 14 days regardless of result:

The US has announced its support for a global waiver on patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines in a major policy reversal.
The Biden administration has announced support for waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines.
The move was in a response to the “extraordinary circumstances” of the COVID-19 pandemic, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement.
“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines.
“We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) needed to make that happen.
“These negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.”
This is a monumental moment in the fight against #COVID19. The commitment by @POTUS Joe Biden & @USTradeRep@AmbassadorTai to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of ðºð¸ leadership to address global health challenges. pic.twitter.com/3iBt3jfdEr
RELATED: ‘Madness’: Wild new vaccine theory
The US has come under increasing pressure from countries like India and South Africa to support waivers. Pharmaceutical companies eyeing big profits have lobbied hard to keep them in place.
“The Administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,” Ms Tai said in her statement.
“As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts — working with the private sector and all possible partners — to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.
“It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines.”
The global rollout of the vaccine has been lopsided.
In January more people had been immunised in Israel — with its population of less than 10 million — than in Africa and Latin America combined.
THIS MATTER IS CRITICAL
The WTO has for months been facing calls to temporarily remove the intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines.
Proponents say that would help boost production in developing countries that so far have received far fewer jabs.
But that notion has been met with fierce opposition from pharmaceutical giants and their host countries, which insist the patents are not the main roadblocks to scaling up production, and warn the move could hamper innovation.
WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the way the issue was handled was “critical”.
“We need to have a sense of urgency on how we approach this issue of response to COVID-19 because the world is watching,” she said, describing equitable access to the tools to fight the pandemic as the “moral and economic issue of our time”.

Just hours after NSW health officials revealed a shock new local case of COVID-19, other states were quick to respond.
Health authorities in several jurisdictions have issued advice for residents in response to the shocking news that NSW had recorded a new locally-acquired case of COVID-19.
Advice from the Queensland health department states that anyone who has visited any Sydney hotspot venues at the listed exposure times must quarantine at their home, contact the department and get tested as soon as possible.
Queensland's chief health officer Jeannette Young said it was essential people who may have been exposed to the virus stay home.
BREAKING: New requirements are in place after a person from the eastern suburbs of Sydney tested positive to COVID-19. Find the list of locations here: https://t.co/T0b6Rtiwbipic.twitter.com/byeOVYcUnz
“NSW Health has already made it clear that anyone who has been to any of those venues should be quarantining and not getting on flights,” Dr Young said.
“We’re working closely with NSW to get a better understanding of the risk associated with this case, so as an interim measure, we’re mirroring NSW Health’s advice.”
She said the department would continue to assess the situation and urged residents to monitor the government website for updates.
The Victorian government also issued advice, declaring all of NSW would remain a ‘green zone’ until more about the new infection was known “including genomic sequencing results”.
That means anyone from anywhere in NSW can travel freely to Victoria but should still apply for a travel permit.
But anyone who is in Victoria and attended an infected venue will be classified as a ‘tier 1’ and must get tested and isolate for the full 14 days.
“Using travel permit data, the department will today message people who have entered VIC from NSW since 30 April,” the Victorian Department of Health said on Twitter.
“Flight manifests have been requested from the National Incident Room. Authorised Officer presence and spot checking will be increased for flights from Sydney.”
SA Health had similar advice, saying anyone who was at a hot spot venue must get tested and isolate.
The man who tested positive is in his 50s and lives in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
He returned a positive result on Wednesday, sparking several venue alerts.

NSW Health is now racing to work out how the man caught the disease given he has no links to hotel quarantine, border control or health.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said urgent genomic sequencing was underway.
“All of the usual routes where we would expect someone to have acquired the infection are not clear,” Dr Chant said.
“And that’s why this ... requires us to do that genome sequencing to give us that understanding of where that source of infection was, and then we can work backwards from that.”

Sky News host Chris Kenny says the single new community case of COVID-19 in New South Wales “should not be such big news”.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday had a snap press conference to announce the case.

“The paranoia is running deep,” Mr Kenny said.

“Berejiklian had a better take on all of this stuff recently back in April when she said each infection should not be big news.

“We need to tone this down … stop being alarmist, stop scaring people, stop making a disaster out of every single infection of a disease that is mild or even asymptomatic for 99 per cent of Australians who get it.”

NSW Health has expressed grave concerns about the recent case of community transmission as the man in his 50s has a high viral load making him potentially extremely infectious.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Wednesday, health authorities discovered a case of COVID-19 in a man in his 50s who had been “very active” in Sydney’s inner east.

Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant expressed concerns around the origins of the case as the man had not travelled overseas, nor worked in border security or hotel quarantine.

She also said the man has a high viral load and could be potentially very infectious, but genomic sequencing and testing of close contacts would be needed to confirm his strain and infectiousness.

“So the CT values in this case were low, so just to be clear low CT values mean that you have a higher viral load and therefore potentially are more infectious, so they do give us some cause for concern,” she said.

“The next ring of testing around this case will actually tell us whether he's passed it on but also in this case we're really interested in how this person acquired the infection to understand the broader risk in the community.”

Multiple new venues have been added to a growing list of places across Sydney - including a Westfield - visited by a man infected with COVID-19.
An optometrist and two popular cafes have been added to the growing list of coronavirus exposure sites after a man from Sydney’s eastern suburbs tested positive to the virus.
Health officials said the man, in his 50s, had not travelled overseas recently and did not work in a quarantine hotel, border or health role.
Contact tracers urgently gathered information on his movements before issuing a public alert.
The newest venues on an alert issued at 5pm on Wednesday include District Brasserie in the city centre, an optometrist within the Sofitel and a cafe in Paddington.
Anyone who attended the following venues should get tested and isolate while waiting for further advice from NSW Health.
SYDNEY: District Brasserie at 2 Chifley Square between 11am and 11.45am on April 30.
SYDNEY: HineSight Optometrist at the Sofitel Sydney Wentworth between noon and 1pm on April 30.
PADDINGTON: Barbetta at 1 Elizabeth Street in Paddington between 1.30pm and 2.30pm April 30.
Earlier, restaurants, retail outlets and a cinema were flagged as coronavirus hot spots in NSW, following news of the new case.
Anyone who attended one of the following venues at the times specified is asked to immediately get tested and isolate until NSW Health provided further information.
This advice applied to everyone, including those people who may have been partially or fully vaccinated:
BONDI JUNCTION: Screening of The Courier at Event Cinemas; Westfield Bondi Junction 500 Oxford Street; Friday April 30; 6-8pm
RUSHCUTTERS BAY: Figo restaurant; 3/56-60A Bayswater Road; Friday April 30; 8.45-11pm

BONDI JUNCTION: The Meat Store; 262 Oxford Street; Sunday May 2; 3-4pm
In a statement, NSW Health said the man was tested on Tuesday and returned a positive result on Wednesday.
“Genome sequencing is underway, with results expected in the next 24 hours,” it said.
“Close contacts are being urgently contacted, tested and isolating. The man visited a number of venues while potentially infectious.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the case was a “wake up call” that the fight against COVID-19 was still not over.
“I want to stress that health is undertaking genomic testing in relation to strains that exist in our quarantine system, but also the strains that exist in the other states as he may have undertaken some travel duration that time or been exposed to people in other states,” she said.
“We can never be complacent,” she said.
“I can try and do the elbow tap but I know around NSW people are shaking hands and kissing in public. We need to be aware that virus is still around.”

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/escape-travel/news/contiki-to-launch-first-international-trip-since-covid19-pandemic/news-story/256b91891747deb604ca7a830f912140
It was the news Australians waited a year to hear.
When New Zealand finally announced the trans-Tasman travel bubble last month, it brought relief to those aching to see loved ones and hope to frustrated travellers keen for an adventure.
At youth travel company Contiki, the announcement was its green light to get back to what it did best – helping young people discover the world.
Now, more than a year after global tours were aborted due to the worsening coronavirus crisis, the first international Contiki trip since the pandemic is about to set off in New Zealand.
Contiki is offering 11 tours across the ditch, with the first cab off the rank, the Sweet As tour of the South Island, departing on May 23.
The company brought back Australian domestic tours at the end of last year but international travel was what everyone was really waiting for. As soon as the trans-Tasman travel bubble was announced last month, Contiki saw bookings of its New Zealand tours skyrocket by 300 per cent.
“We’ve had trips in Australia, and people have been excited about seeing their own backyard, but the essence of Contiki is seeing the world,” Contiki Australia’s managing director Katrina Barry told news.com.au.

“It’s really nice to see borders finally reopening and groups of young people are able to come together and connect with each other through their love of travel.
“I think people have been feeling a little bit gypped that 2020 took that away from us, that big overseas holiday or that gap year, and we know the younger generation has been more open to travelling as soon as they can.”
Research by Contiki into the travel attitudes of 18 to 35-year-olds found not only were they raring to get out and see the world, they missed opportunities to meet strangers and make friends overseas.
“There had been a bit of a trend towards younger people being a bit too cool to go on a group trip, but they’re telling us that now, they’re really missing connecting with other people,” Ms Barry said.
“Contiki is flavour of the month now. They’re realising they can go overseas and meet people from all over the world and a company is going to make sure the experience is fun but safe for them.”


It had been a long year for the travel industry, and tour operators in particular, since international borders slammed shut in March last year. Contiki’s entire global network of hundreds of tours across six continents was brought to a standstill.
“No one knew how long it would go on,” Ms Barry said. “But we thought, never waste a crisis. What can we do that will make us smarter and better? What are the projects we’ve been wanted to do for ages but never have time to do?”
As the long months ticked by, Contiki kept busy with its sustainability strategy – it recently announced it will be an entirely carbon neutral company by 2022 – and went about vetting each of the companies it worked with on tours, from hotels and restaurants to transport operators to ensure they’d be up to top-notch standard when travel returned.

Australian trips resumed late last year, including an island-hopping tour of North Queensland, and then it was a matter of waiting for that bubble with our neighbours across the ditch.
With New Zealand tours about to get under way, Ms Barry said Contiki was already looking ahead to Singapore, which is likely to be the next destination to open a travel bubble with Australia.
“We’re thinking Japan after the Olympics as well,” she said.
As the world continues to reopen in travel bubbles, young tourists are likely to lead the charge, armed with savings and built-up annual leave, and perhaps more adventurous and flexible than older generations.
While Contiki’s best selling European tours have generally been around 14 days long, the current top selling tour is a mammoth 45-day odyssey across Europe in 2022.
“I think there’s a sense among young people of, ‘I didn’t appreciate travelling as much when it was too easy and it was constantly there for me’,” Ms Barry said.
“Now they don’t want to take it for granted and want to see and do as much as they can. They’re thinking, ‘I want a long trip, a big trip, because I don’t know when I might be able to do that again’.”

Authorities have revealed how they believe a quarantine hotel security guard contracted COVID-19 before infecting two of his housemates.
A security guard at a quarantine hotel in Perth may have contracted COVID-19 after handling the luggage of two infected travellers.
The Perth and Peel region narrowly avoided another lockdown after the security guard at the Pan Pacific Hotel infected two of his housemates, but the community has been forced to wear masks and other restrictions have also been imposed.
Health authorities previously said they believed a traveller from the United States infected a person coming from Indonesia while they shared a flight into Perth, then one of them infected the guard.
Premier Mark McGowan revealed on Wednesday that CCTV footage showed the guard was wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when he handled luggage inside a lift.
“He entered the lift that they had been in, we know that, and he handled some luggage – that’s what the CCTV has showed us,” Mr McGowan said.
“He was masked up, he was wearing all the appropriate gear.
“He handled their luggage, but was there transmission there? We can only speculate.”
Authorities have identified 108 close contacts, of which 75 have tested negative so far.
A further 476 casual contacts have been identified, of which 221 have so far tested negative.
Mr McGowan also gave an update on the man in Collie who returned a “weak positive result” for coronavirus.
The man, aged in his 30s, recently returned to Collie after travelling to Australia from Poland and quarantining in Melbourne for two weeks.
“The very, very strong medical advice is this is an historic case,” Mr McGowan said.
“This person is doing what is called shedding of the virus, which sometimes means that a positive test is picked up even though the person is not infectious.
“I just urge everyone in Collie not to worry, not to panic. We’ll get information out as soon as we possibly can.”
Shortly after Mr McGowan’s press conference, the Health Department issued a statement confirming it was an historical case.
“The man in his 30s poses no threat to community health and has not been included as a positive case in WA statistics,” the department said.
“As a precaution, the man’s three closest contacts were asked to isolate pending further test results, including antibody tests.
“All have been advised of the result and are no longer required to self-isolate.”
Western Australia did not record any local cases overnight, but two new infections were noted in hotel quarantine — two young children who returned from overseas with their parents.
It brings the state’s total number of infections to 1010, including 26 active cases.
Perth currently has 1895 people in hotel quarantine.
“The number is tracking down very slowly, but tracking down because of our reduction in the cap,” Mr McGowan said.
An announcement on lifting restrictions is expected to be made on Thursday.

NSW has recorded a worrying, sharp increase in COVID-19 cases among returned travellers in hotel quarantine overnight.
New South Wales has registered double-digit numbers of COVID-19 cases in hotel quarantine for the second time in five days while the state recorded one case locally.
Overnight, 10 new cases were acquired in overseas travellers.
The locally acquired case, a Sydney man in his 50s from southeastern Sydney, tested positive on Wednesday morning – the first case in NSW in more than a month.
The number of overseas cases ranged between three and seven during the past four days, after flights from India were halted due to growing strain being put on the quarantine system towards the end of April.
NSW recorded 12 cases on April 27, then nine, 15 and 13 cases in the days after.

The federal government on Monday suspended flights from India until mid-May.
The ban on travellers from India was based on health advice from Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly, who said the proportion of COVID-19 positive cases in people arriving from the nation had sharply increased to more than 50 per cent since mid-April.
All passenger flights from India to Australia were grounded on Monday as the country continued to grapple with the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak.
India has averaged more than 300,000 new daily COVID-19 cases over the last 12 days, putting severe pressure on hospitals and oxygen supplies.
Travellers to Australia who defy the ban face fines of more than $60,000, a five-year jail term or both.
“Our advice was we need to do something about the number of these cases coming into our hotel quarantine because of the risk of incursions,” Dr Kelly said.
“The biggest risk coming from – by far and away that was coming from people arriving from India. So, that was the advice given, the public health advice. And then the response to that was obviously a decision of Government to use the Biosecurity Act in that way.”
Since December 11, 1555 cases have been detected in Australian hotel quarantine.
Travellers from India have recorded a large contribution to that total, with 324 cases in total. In April alone, there were 210 cases.
Travellers from the US have accounted for 172 cases since December 11 while Papua New Guinea’s COVID-19 crises has contributed 108 cases to Australian hotel quarantine.

Australian cricket legend Michael Hussey has reportedly tested positive to the coronavirus as he remains trapped in India.
Australian cricket legend Michael Hussey has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.
The 45-year-old was working as a batting coach for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League, and is one of many Australians trapped in the country following Scott Morrison’s decision to introduce a hard border closure.
Early on Wednesday morning AEST, The Times of India reported Hussey had become the first Australian in the IPL bubble to test positive for the coronavirus.
According to the publication, he was tested twice with both coming back positive.
The glamorous T20 tournament was indefinitely suspended on Tuesday evening after several cricketers and staff members contracted the virus.
The Kolkata Knight Riders were placed in isolation after players Varun Chakravarthy and Sandeep Warrier tested positive on Monday, along with three staff members from the Super Kings — chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan, bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji and a bus cleaner.
The IPL decided to take an indefinite pause on Tuesday as Sunrisers Hyderabad wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha — a teammate of David Warner — joined the growing list.
Television crew and venue staff also contracted coronavirus as the integrity of the tournament’s biosecurity bubble was compromised.
Hussey played 79 Test matches and 185 one-day internationals for Australia, scoring 22 centuries and 11,677 runs.
He featured in the 2006/07 Ashes whitewash and 2007 Cricket World Cup triumph.
More than 30 Australian players, commentators, umpires and coaching staff participated in the IPL — including Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, Glenn Maxwell and Ricky Ponting.
The Australian talent in India now face an anxious wait to get home, with Morrison’s Government introducing fines of up to $66,600 or five years in prison for anyone defying the strict travel ban — currently in place until May 15.
On Tuesday, Warner shared an emotional Instagram post with a message from his daughters and wife with a desperate plea: “Please Daddy come home straight away”.
Stay safe daddy, come home soon we love you. @davidwarner31pic.twitter.com/VXkrIzWomx
The temporary travel ban was designed to allow for hotel quarantine upgrades in Australia before an influx of citizens fleeing COVID-ravaged India.
Last week, Morrison said Australian cricket players and coaches in India would not be given preferential treatment.
“They’ve travelled there privately under their own arrangements. This wasn’t part of an Australian tour,” Morrison said.
“And they’re under their own resources and they’ll be using those resources, I’m sure, to see them return to Australia in accordance with our own arrangements.”
The Aussies knew they would be required to spend 14 days in quarantine upon returning home — they did not anticipate being locked out of the country with a threat of jail time.
“Up until now, I felt incredibly safe in the bubble they created,” Cummins told Fox Sports’ Back Page from his Ahmedabad hotel room on Tuesday.
“Arriving, we had to do seven days quarantine, tests every two days, we had to wear masks in the hotel, literally the only people we have seen are hotel staff who are getting tested every day and members of our team.
“Once we flew out from Australia, we knew we faced 14 days quarantine coming home, so you always feel that little bit further away from getting home, but as soon as that hard border shut, obviously no one has ever experienced that before.
“It added a little bit of anxiety for some of the Aussies over here, but hopefully it all opens on May 15 and we are able to get back.”
Earlier this week, Indian coach Ravi Shastri told SEN that the IPL bubbles were the safest place in India.
Kolkata teammate Ben Cutting told Fox Sports: “Last year we had the IPL held over in the UAE and that was, you know, an incredibly, incredibly well run tournament. No hiccups at all.
“I think this year they tried to push that little step further and have it over in multiple cities in India. So I’m sure looking back, there might have tweaked a few things.
“It’s a shame, and there’s obviously there’s been a few cases in the last couple of days.
“Up until now felt incredibly safe and confident in the bubble they’ve created.”
IPL commentator and former Australian Test batter Michael Slater flew to the Maldives on the weekend, where he will wait until he can legally return home.
According to The Australian, some of the 30-odd Australians are considering a similar move — there is also talk of ordering a charter flight to Dubai.
Slater tweeted on Monday evening: “If our Government cared for the safety of Aussies they would allow us to get home. It’s a disgrace!
“Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this. How about you sort out quarantine system.
“I had government permission to work on the IPL but I now have government neglect.”
Australian cricketers Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson returned home last week before the travel restrictions were introduced.
Last month, West Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh and New South Wales paceman Josh Hazlewood abandoned their IPL commitments before travelling to Asia.
India is recording approximately 360,000 cases and 3500 deaths a day and has been hit by chronic shortages of hospital beds and oxygen.
A huge international effort is underway to deliver much-needed oxygen to cities around India where coronavirus cases have skyrocketed to the point where people infected, including babies, have died while waiting for treatment outside hospitals.
Long queues were seen at vaccination centres across the weekend, with people desperate to be inoculated against a disease that has overwhelmed the healthcare system.
Social media platforms have been flooded with pleas from people looking for oxygen cylinders, medicines and hospital beds as the COVID-19 wave causes widespread shortages.
Last week, Cummins donated $50,000 to help the nation fight the outbreak, calling for other players to contribute.
Cricket Australia and the Australia Cricketers’ Association released a joint statement on Tuesday following the IPL’s decision to postpone the tournament.
“CA is in direct contact with the BCCI as they work through plans to ensure the safe accommodation and repatriation of Australian players, coaches, match officials and commentators back home to Australia,” the statement read.
“CA and the ACA respect the decision of the Australian Government to pause travel from India until at least May 15 and will not seek exemptions.
“CA and the ACA thank the BCCI for their efforts and co-operation for the safe repatriation of all participants at the IPL.”
India is scheduled to host the Men’s T20 World Cup in October, with several reports suggesting the event could be moved to the United Arab Emirates.
Australia’s highest-profile cricketers have been stuck in limbo since the Indian travel ban but could be among the first citizens to return home.
Tim Paine wouldn’t miss the Ashes for quids but beyond that series, retirement is a distinct possibility - and the current Aussie Test skipper has given his support to a potential next leader.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine factory in Belgium, where capacity is ramping up
Pfizer sharply increased its 2021 profit projections on Tuesday, citing much higher Covid-19 vaccine sales which are on track to provide a "durable" revenue stream in the wake of the pandemic.
The drugmaker reported a jump in first-quarter profits based on surging revenues, with nearly one-fourth of sales coming from Covid-19 vaccines.
But the surging profits have drawn criticism as governments face pressure to step in to ensure vaccines are provided to underserved countries.
The company is studying the efficacy of giving the jabs six or more months after the second vaccine dose, and developing doses that could be stored at standard refrigerated temperature for up to 10 weeks.
"It is our hope that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will continue to have a global impact by helping to get the devastating pandemic under control and helping economies around the world not only open, but stay open," Bourla said in prepared remarks.
Pfizer has won wide praise for its technological prowess in developing a game-changing vaccine in record time. However, critics called the profits troubling given the divide in vaccine availability between rich and poor countries.
India and South Africa are leading an effort in the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property and patent rules, at least temporarily, which would open the door to broader production of vaccines at a time when the virus is causing mass misery in India and some other countries.
Biden also said he was ready to "immediately" begin vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds as soon as Pfizer's Covid shot is approved by regulators for the age group.
Pfizer reported net income of $4.9 billion, up 45 percent from the same period of the prior year.
The results include the lift from Covid-19 vaccines, which generated profit margins of "high-20s," implying around $900 million in profits in the most recent quarter.
The company has reached an agreement to provide up to 40 million doses for Covax, a globally-pooled coronavirus vaccine procurement effort aimed at providing vaccines to low- and middle-income economies.
- Criticism of profits -
The company said it is charging $19.50 per vaccine dose in the United States, but has not disclosed its US profit margin.
"Pfizer is cashing in on the crisis and hoarding technology, even as billions of people around the world go without a vaccine," Rizvi said in an email to AFP.
The company is building more capacity and expects to manufacture at least three billion doses in 2022, up from 2.5 billion now expected in 2021. In February, Pfizer said it expected to produce up to two billion doses in 2021.

Confidential documents have revealed a senior bureaucrat in Victoria’s government who was responsible for managing COVID-19 quarantine control breached protocols on two separate occasions. 

General Manager of COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria’s Infection Prevention and Control Matiu Bush is the figure at the centre of these new allegations laid out by The Australian newspaper.

On April 20 Mr Bush reportedly went to exit the InterContinental hotel quarantine facility and refused to have the mandatory quarantine test when asked by health workers, claiming he had the authority to do so.

The second incident occurred on March 1 when he went to the Pullman hotel but failed to check in on his personal QR code system before visiting another hotel where he failed to sanitise his hands or change his face mask.

The revelations surrounding Mr Bush’s breaches in infection control have been accompanied by a secret report also obtained by The Australian attributing Victoria’s third outbreak to a previously unknown incident.

The report found the virus escaped into a hotel corridor after a woman in the hotel quarantine system was swabbed by a health worker in an open doorway and not by a nebuliser as previously thought.

It brings the total number to more than 20 million but there are questions about the accuracy of figures, especially in remote areas.

India’s virus caseload has topped a gargantuan number, forcing the suspension of the world’s richest Twenty20 cricket tournament.
India’s coronavirus caseload topped 20 million on Tuesday as the relentless surge finally forced the suspension of the nation’s lucrative cricket competition involving some of the sport’s biggest global stars.
The South Asian nation’s plight was in stark contrast to Europe and the United States, where mass vaccinations have allowed the easing of many coronavirus restrictions.
More than 350,000 new cases were reported in India Tuesday, a drop from the peak of 402,000 last week, giving some cause for optimism that the worst of the devastating wave may have passed. But daily deaths are still high at 3500.
“If daily cases and deaths are analysed, there is a very early signal of movement in the positive direction,” senior health ministry official Lav Aggarwal told reporters.
“But these are very early signals. There is a need to further analyse it.”

India’s healthcare infrastructure has struggled to cope with the huge number of cases, with deep shortages of medicines, hospital beds and medical oxygen.
But the glitzy Indian Premier League, the world’s richest Twenty20 cricket tournament, had carried on in empty stadiums, sparking criticism that it was inappropriate under the circumstances.
Organisers said they did not want to compromise the safety of staff and players, including some of the world’s biggest cricket stars from India, Australia, England and New Zealand.
“These are difficult times, especially in India and while we have tried to bring in some positivity and cheer … it is imperative that the tournament is now suspended,” they said in a statement.
More states are beginning to implement lockdown across the country as its vaccination program falters after reaching an all-time high last month.
On April 5 the country hit a peak of 4.5 million but that number has since dropped to below two million.
Clinics in one of its worst hit cities, Delhi, a handful of clinics have begun vaccinating young adults.
The wave in the South Asian nation — spurred by huge gatherings including the Hindu festival Kumbh Mela — has highlighted the danger of COVID-19, which has already claimed more than 3.2 million lives worldwide.
Religious events are a threat in neighbouring Pakistan too, where authorities are battling a third wave of infections and urging Muslims to observe precautions during the Islamic month of Ramadan.
Despite the warnings, thousands of Shia Muslims — many not wearing masks — gathered in the eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday for an annual religious procession.
Pakistani authorities have largely avoided clamping down on such religious activities in recent months even as markets and schools have been closed.
EU eyes travel resumption
Leaders in Europe, meanwhile, were looking to take further steps towards recovery with a proposal to revive international travel and tourism as early as next month.
The European Commission proposed Monday that travellers who are fully vaccinated with EU-approved shots or those coming from countries where COVID-19 is under control should be allowed to enter the bloc.
The EU has so far approved the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines.
But in a sign that the pandemic is not yet over in Europe, Germany cancelled its world-famous Oktoberfest beer festival for a second year running.
Americans are among those eyeing possible European vacations this summer, with more than 100 million people in the United States now fully vaccinated.
US media reported Monday that authorities were expected to authorise the Pfizer shot for children aged 12 and up.
The successful drive has allowed authorities in many parts of the world’s biggest economy to start relaxing curbs, including New York and Florida.
And in China, where the virus first emerged in 2019, millions of tourists have flocked to domestic tourist attractions with the country’s outbreak largely under control.
Beijing’s historic alleyways were packed with camera-wielding visitors Tuesday, after out-of-towners also mobbed popular sites in Shanghai over the weekend.
WHO plea to G7
But in hard-hit Brazil, vaccine shortages have forced several large cities to suspend administering second doses of the Chinese-developed CoronaVac shot.
COVID-19 has claimed more than 400,000 lives in Brazil — second only to the United States.
Warning about the global inequality in access to COVID-19 supplies, the WHO said Monday that rich countries must step up their funding for vaccines, tests and treatments in poorer nations if the pandemic is to be brought to an end.
“We will only solve the vaccine crisis with the leadership of these countries,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, urging decisive action at the G7 summit in June.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/breaking-news/man-in-regional-wa-tests-positive-for-covid19-after-leaving-hotel-quarantine-in-melbourne/news-story/5b7e1a2f79fa2765fc3c5ce143fdd395
A man has returned a weak positive to coronavirus after leaving hotel quarantine in Melbourne and travelling to another state.
A man in regional Western Australia has been diagnosed with COVID-19 after quarantining in a Melbourne hotel, but health authorities have described the case as a “very weak positive”.
The Health Department said the positive test result was most likely evidence of an historic infection.
The man, aged in his 30s, recently returned to Collie after travelling to Australia from Poland and quarantining in Melbourne for two weeks.
“He tested negative to COVID-19 on all his tests while in hotel quarantine,” the department said.
“On his return to Collie, he was retested as part of Vic Health’s follow-up of people post-quarantine.
“He returned a very weak positive result, which is sometimes seen in people with old, recovered infections.”
Out of an abundance of caution, the man has been retested.
His three closest contacts have also been told to isolate pending test results, including antibody tests, which are expected to return on Wednesday.
“We are asking the community not to panic and to be assured that WA Health will advise the community if results indicate this is an infectious case,” the department said.
Premier Mark McGowan took to social media to explain why the Health Department had advised the risk to the community was low.
“Long story short — a man who had returned from overseas and completed hotel quarantine in Victoria has returned a very weak positive test result, which is sometimes seen in people who have recovered from an infection previously,” he said.
“WA Health believes the test result most likely reflects an historic infection but out of an abundance of caution is now retesting the man to clarify his infection status.
“We will provide updates and advise the community if results indicate this is an infectious case.”
The Perth and Peel regions narrowly avoided going into another lockdown after a quarantine security guard at the Pan Pacific Hotel and two of his housemates tested positive for COVID-19.
A total of 79 close contacts have been identified, with 49 of those returning a negative result so far.
A further 429 casual contacts have been identified, with 134 having returned a negative result so far.
The community has been forced to wear masks in public and sport has been played without crowds in recent days under a raft of restrictions imposed.
Most restrictions are expected to be lifted by Saturday and Mr McGowan has flagged giving an update on the situation later this week.

Liberal MP Andrew Bragg says the government is “following the advice of health agencies” with regard to the temporary India travel ban and the harsh penalties for breaking the ban. “We are following the advice of the health agencies here and putting in place the strongest possible deterrents and these are very strong deterrents,” he told Sky News. “It’s regrettable they are necessary but we are trying to do our best to address the situation of the transmission that’s been occurring in places like Howard Springs.” Mr Bragg said there was “very strong community feeling” in Indian and Australian communities but data from the Northern Territory quarantine facility showed COVID-19 cases dropping. “I think the data that is out of again Howard Springs is already that has had the effect that’s been desired and now there’s a lower level of cases in that facility.”
Townsville Hospital and Health Service’s rural staff vaccination program recommenced today with Ingham Health Service the first stop on the rural North Queensland road trip.
Executive director nursing and midwifery and COVID-19 vaccination project lead Judy Morton said the team were excited to recommence rural vaccinations.
“Nine staff will be hitting the road from Tuesday and visiting Ingham, Ayr and Charters Towers over the next three days, vaccinating health service staff and emergency services,” she said.
“We then have three additional follow-up visits scheduled, so we will be administering both first and second doses to staff over the next few weeks.”
Ingham Health Service midwife Virginia Meyjes did not hesitate when it came to booking in for her vaccination.
“As a front-line health worker I felt vaccination was an important way to give my clients that extra layer of safety, as well as to protect the more vulnerable members of my family such as my (very healthy) 91-year-old mother,” she said.
“Being in a rural town there is a sense that we are in this protected bubble, but the reality is we don’t know who’s been where; vaccination is the best way to protect the community and I would encourage everyone to play their part.”
Judy said the health service would continue to vaccinate staff in line with Federal Government recommendations.
“The most important thing to remember is that vaccination is incredibly safe, and adverse reactions are rare,” she said.
“I’m very proud of the vaccination team for working tirelessly to make sure our rural staff had access to vaccination as soon as was practical.”

A KFC store has been added to the list of venues potentially exposed to coronavirus after contact tracers poured through CCTV.
A Coles Express, Pizza Hut, 7 Eleven service station and KFC are among the locations that have been added to the COVID-19 public exposure sites list in Perth, as contact tracing continues.
The Perth and Peel regions still have some restrictions in place, including the use of masks in public, after a hotel quarantine security guard and two of his housemates contracted coronavirus.
Western Australia did not record any new cases overnight, either in the community or in hotel quarantine.
The Health Department said it was able to add some locations to its list of places visited by confirmed cases, as well as refine details for others, following further contact tracing and a review of CCTV footage.

Mark McGowan refuses to rule out another lockdown as West Australians await the test results of contacts linked to a hotel quarantine worker.
West Australian health authorities are racing to confirm test results of more than 200 close and casual contacts of a hotel quarantine worker who infected his housemates with COVID-19.
No new cases were detected in the community or in state-managed hotel quarantine in the previous 24 hours, Premier Mark McGowan confirmed on Tuesday morning.
“Contact tracing in relation to the Pan Pacific cluster is ongoing,” he said.
“Of the 79 close contacts, 49 have come back negative and the others are pending.
“Of the 429 casual contacts, 234 are negative and we expect that number will grow today as we wait for further results to come through.”
It comes as new locations have been added to the public exposure sites list.
While Perth has so far avoided another lockdown after the three cases of community transmission were detected over the weekend, Mr McGowan confirmed the Perth Glory A-League game on Wednesday night would be played without a crowd.
Mr McGowan also said the state government was rolling out a $2m grants program to support health initiatives for India.
“We will work with local community groups here in WA to provide support to India through whatever can be done,” he said.
“There are local Indian groups providing support into India, we will assist them with funding.
“If they are able to acquire PPE or oxygen, we’ll support them to get as much into India as possible.
“What’s happening in India is a human tragedy. As a state we want to make sure we do our bit. The sooner it gets resolved, the better.”
WA carried out 7534 tests in the last 24 hours, and there are 26 active cases in hotels and hospitals.

Ipswich Hospital Foundation’s Park2Park is back on track for Sunday July 25, after missing a last year due to COVID-19.
While all main events are back on for 2021, the virtual Run for Research that was organised in lieu of the regular event last year is continuing, giving participants the option to accomplish their goal in their own time.
The virtual Run for Research spans from July 17-31 with a registration fee of $30.
There’s a distance for everyone with each event, from the half marathon run and relay to the 5km run and walk.
Ipswich families are encouraged to get into teams of four and participate in the Family Challenge, which is a 400m obstacle course.
Each event will be held on the Bill Patterson Oval at Limestone Park.

Park2Park director Chris Gale encouraged Ipswich residents to get into groups and participate.
“For the best experience, we’re encouraging everyone to run for research together in a team,” he said.
“We’ve even got some prizes for the biggest social team, fitness team, primary school team, and even high school team.
“Get your friends, family, and everyone you know to join a team with you.”
Ipswich Hospital Foundation CEO James Sturges said funds raised would go towards local research, which in turn would help the hospital become a tertiary teaching facility.

“We’re entering an exciting time for both West Moreton Health and the Foundation. We are on a path to becoming a tertiary, teaching hospital,” Mr Sturges said.
“For us to get there, we need to support our local hospital with local research opportunities and funding.
“By advancing with local research and taking the steps to become a tertiary hospital, this will mean locals won’t need to travel as far for healthcare they currently do for.
“Funding local research will bring better care closer to home for our community.”

Two members of the Kolkata Knight Riders squad have tested positive to COVID-19, throwing the Indian Premier League into disarray.
Monday evening’s Indian Premier League match between the Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore was rescheduled after two players tested positive to COVID-19.
Kolkata’s players and staff have been placed in isolation after Varun Chakravarthy and Sandeep Warrier tested positive to the virus.

Australian stars Pat Cummins and Ben Cutting feature in the Knight Riders squad, along with England captain Eoin Morgan.
Cricket.com.au reported that one of the infected players recently went to hospital after suffering a stomach complaint, which is believed to be the likely time of infection.
The IPL released a statement confirming Monday’s fixture in Ahmedabad had been rescheduled.
“Both the players have isolated themselves from the rest of the squad. The Medical Team is in continuous touch with the duo and are monitoring their health. Meanwhile, the Kolkata Knight Riders have now moved towards a daily testing routine to identify any other possible cases and treat them at the earliest.,” the statement read.
“The Medical Team is also determining the close and casual contacts of the two positive cases during the 48 hours prior to collection of the sample that returned the positive test results.
“The BCCI and the Kolkata Knight Riders prioritise the health and safety of everyone involved and all measures are being taken in that endeavour.”
The Knight Riders are currently seventh on the IPL ladder, having won two of their opening seven fixtures.
Soon after, ESPNcricinfo reported three members of the Chennai Super Kings camp had also tested positive for COVID-19 — chief executive officer Kasi Viswanathan, bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji and a bus cleaner.
Meanwhile, five ground staff at the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) reportedly tested positive to the virus as well, making that 10 cases in the IPL bubble all up.
The quintet had reportedly been on duty for the recent IPL match between the Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad.

For a month, weâve heard that the IPL bubble has been the safest place to be in India. Any sort of COVID concern within that bubble then is a serious matter or so youâd think #IPL2021
The glamorous T20 tournament has proceeded without crowds as the number of coronavirus cases in India escalated at an alarming rate.
Australian cricketers Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson returned home last week as India’s coronavirus situation worsened.
There were nearly 400,000 new cases registered across India on Sunday in the world’s fastest-growing outbreak — the country of 1.3 billion also reported 3689 coronavirus deaths.
A huge international effort is underway to deliver much-needed oxygen to cities around India where coronavirus cases have skyrocketed to the point where people infected, including babies, have died while waiting for treatment outside hospitals.
Long queues were seen at vaccination centres across the weekend, with people desperate to be inoculated against a disease that has overwhelmed the healthcare system.
Social media platforms have been flooded with pleas from people looking for oxygen cylinders, medicines and hospital beds as the COVID-19 wave causes widespread shortages.
Last week, Cummins donated $50,000 to help the nation fight the outbreak, calling for other players to contribute to the PM Cares Fund.

Speaking to SEN earlier on Monday, Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said there were no plans to bring the Australian players home via a chartered flight.
“There’s no suggestion at the moment of any charter flight,” Hockley said.
“We’re working closely and talking closely with the ACA (Australian Cricketers’ Association), with the players and with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) to make sure everyone’s okay and the people have got full information.
“We’ve been in touch with the players there and they are generally in good spirits.
“The work the BCCI has done around the (biosecurity) bubble means they are feeling safe and secure, and those we’ve talked to are generally planning to complete their playing commitments.
“The BCCI have come out and said they understand and want to support the players in making sure they get home safely at the end.
“The tournament doesn’t finish until the 30th of May, so for the moment it’s monitor the situation and as we get closer to the end of the tournament we’ll need to see where the situation is at.”

As India struggles with its latest coronavirus crisis, one hospital is so bad its patients are begging to leave instead of begging for treatment.
As India continues to struggle to contain its second wave, one makeshift hospital is so bad that patients are now “begging to leave”.
The crisis has spiked to a point where local media are calling the situation “grim”, with critical patients dropping dead in cardboard beds and on the side of the road as they wait for available space.
Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre and Hospital is a makeshift COVID-19 facility in Chhatarpur, on the outskirts of New Delhi. Its mission is to provide emergency care for the thousands struggling to breathe.
But 25-year-old Goldi Patel’s husband is not begging for oxygen there; he’s begging to leave.

RELATED: Woman reveals father’s harrowing final words in India
Sadanand Patel, 30, is receiving such little treatment that he’s scared he will die in the very hospital that’s meant to save him.
He told CNN, “through laboured breathing” from his hospital bed: “I am very scared, if my health gets critical I don’t think they will be able to save me.”
The report said “he watched two men in beds nearby scream for medicine only to die within hours when their oxygen appeared to run out”.
But he’s not the only one. Desperate pleas scatter social media with the names of patients and desperate families pleading with Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal for more supplies.
One warned others the hospital had had no oxygen for the past 15 hours while 49-year-old Jashuwanta Bora’s oxygen was going down so fast his family pleaded for an ICU bed online.

It’s not any better outside the centre, where two women were seen crying next to a 45-year-old man who was lying on the back seat of a car. “He was not moving or responding to their calls,” The Hindu reported. Death, it seems, is inescapable here.
“We have been waiting here for two hours. Now there is no pulse. They even refused to check him even after we said that there was no pulse” Megh Singh, 60, his relative said.
India — particularly its capital, Delhi — has been hard struck by variant strains of COVID-19 and the number of deaths continues to rise despite the city being placed in lockdown two weeks ago.
India’s total COVID-19 caseload neared 20 million and oxygen shortages exacerbated a devastating second wave on Monday.
On Sunday, Delhi recorded more than 400 COVID-related deaths in a single day for the second consecutive day.
On Saturday, the city had recorded its highest ever COVID death toll in 24 hours at 412 deaths.
Worse, experts say the death rate will continue to rise with just over 3400 deaths and 368,000 new cases yesterday.
There are now 92,290 active cases of COVID-19 in Delhi, and only 20,000 COVID beds in the city’s hospitals.
Its positivity rate has been exceedingly high for the last two weeks at more than 30 per cent, or one in three tests returning a positive result.
That rate has dropped slightly to 28.33 but it’s not enough; hospitals are still overwhelmed and supplies remain critically low due to the large numbers of cases. Patients are dying on the streets, out the front of hospitals, or begging to be moved. Some die in waiting rooms before they even get to see a doctor.
Patients lying on cardboard
Only the lucky few are admitted into India’s struggling hospital system but once there, some wish they were out. Everywhere you turn, patients are breathing heavily, gasping for air, quivering.
The Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre reopened to the New Delhi community in late April boasting urgent facilities free of cost. Walk-in admissions of needy patients are accepted but generally a reference is needed. The site was closed in February when officials thought India had successfully avoided another surge.
But just two days after its April 26 opening, community members began to report serious cracks after a “huge influx” of patients. Witnesses say more than 200 patients were waiting outside the centre at 11am as chaos ensued due to lack of beds in the giant warehouse facility.
CNN said the centre even resorted to using cardboard beds and patients say they are left to fend for themselves without doctors, nurses or oxygen.
The Indian Express described the reaction as “disappointment” and “despair”.
“The condition is so bad that the patient attendants declared it a “suicide centre”, New Delhi resident Mukesh Khare said. “No water, no food, no care.”
Another called it a “death trap” and said that “patients are crying to get water and food”.

Dead body lay for hours
Patient Mr Patel said that by his fifth day at the hospital, he had watched at least five people around him die. In one case, a deceased patient’s body was left on a bed next to him “for hours” before it was removed.
“You will die lying on your bed because there’s no one to call the doctor,” he said.
In another case, one sick patient who was refused entry died outside the hospital squashed in a small car on the side of the road as she ran out of breath.
“They killed my mother. I kept crying and yelling for help but none came,” Kiran Vyas’s devastated son told media.
Officials are promising delivery of extra supplies and say more beds are on their way, but it is already too late for some.
Cases have soared by around eight million since the end of March, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi under growing pressure to take decisive action to reverse the surge.
“Oxygen is a basic requirement of a hospital and a consistent supply has not been assured. We are constantly firefighting,” the head of the Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital Dr Dinesh told the Indian Express daily.
The first flight to bring stranded Aussies home from India is on its way, and there’s also some much-needed relief on board.

Prince Harry spoke of “service” and received a standing ovation in his first speech since the funeral — but Meghan’s absence was a surprise.
Prince Harry delivered a passionate speech in his first appearance since Prince Philip’s funeral at the Vax Live concert in California — but pregnant wife Meghan was notably absent.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are campaign chairs for Global Citizen’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign and had been billed to take the stage together to “deliver an important global message for vaccine equity during the event”.
Instead, Harry went solo, receiving a rock-star welcome as he addressed the crowd of thousands of vaccinated frontline workers during the taping of the star-studding concert SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.
“We are at a defining moment in the global fight against COVID-19,” said the 36-year-old, who was given a standing ovation as he appeared alongside Jennifer Lopez, Foo Fighters and Sean Penn at the “concert to reunite the world”.
He said the concert, which will be broadcast next weekend, was a celebration of the “frontline heroes” in the crowd and around the world.

“You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all,” he said, before referencing the “service” that is so often referenced by the royals.
“You served and sacrificed, put yourselves in harm’s way and with bravery knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible depth of gratitude, thank you.”
The Duke of Sussex said the virus “does not respect borders” and that “access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography”, as he made his first appearance at a public event since moving to California last year.
“Tonight, we stand in solidarity with the millions of families across India, who are battling a devastating second wave,” he added.
“We’re also coming together because this pandemic cannot end unless we act collectively with an unprecedented commitment to our shared humanity.”
He called for the vaccine to be distributed “to everyone, everywhere”, adding that “we cannot rest or truly recover until there is fair distribution to every corner of the world.”
Dressed in a blue shirt and dark pants, the prince also called vaccine disinformation a “humanitarian crisis” that is “getting worse”.
Host Selena Gomez said the concert was “the best award show of the year” and said she “geeked out” when she saw the line-up of celebrity guests and performers.
The singer called for “doses and dollars” for the world’s poorest countries, as the United States and many Western countries emerge from lockdown as their vaccination programs roll out at speed.

JLo wore a glittering pink dress as she told fans she had been forced to spend Christmas without her mother for the first time due to the pandemic. She then brought her mum on to the stage for a touching performance of Sweet Caroline.
The Foo Fighters performed Back in Black with AC/DC star Brian Johnson. Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd — many wearing uniform — “we ain’t out of the woods yet”, adding “let’s work as hard as we can to make sure we can do this” every night.
Actors Ben Affleck and Olivia Munn and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel were also among the guest stars.
President Joe Biden and First Lady Dr Jill Biden appeared in a video address, with Mr Biden saying the US was “working with leaders around the world to share more vaccines and boost production to make sure every country has the vaccines they need.”
Pope Francis also appeared by video, saying, “I beg you not to forget the most vulnerable” and calling for “a spirit of justice” to ensure “true universal access to vaccines, and a temporary suspension of intellectual property rights.”
Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan shared an urgent plea from India, where cases continue to soar, saying: “My country India is battling with the sudden surge of the second wave of COVID-19. As a global citizen I appeal to all global citizens to rise up, speak to your governments, your pharmaceutical companies, and ask them to donate, to give, to extend a helping hand to the public that needs it the most. Every effort counts.”
Other leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also appeared by video link.
Global Citizen, the advocacy group behind Sunday night’s event, announced that it had raised $53.8 million for vaccine procurement, medical tools and supplies.
Corporate and philanthropic partners have committed to donating $39.5 million to vaccine-sharing program COVAX, which is co-led by the World Health Organisation, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
Gavi will match at least $11.75 million for a total of $51.25 million to help procure nearly 10.3 million vaccine doses, exceeding the 10 million target.
Donors included Mastercard at $25 million, Cisco at $5 million and Procter & Gamble at $5 million, with Spotify contributing $500,000 to vaccines and $500,000 to medical supplies.
More announcements will be made during the YouTube broadcast at 8pm Saturday May 8 local time (10am Sunday May 9 AEST).
The campaign is also calling on governments to begin sharing vaccine doses immediately, and for pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna to urgently provide millions of doses to the poorest nations at cost pricing.
“Critically, we need to see the US and the UK step up and start sharing additional doses, and we need pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna to urgently provide millions of doses to COVAX for the poorest nations at nonprofit prices,” said Global Citizen’s Melbourne-born CEO Hugh Evans.
The concert is part of Global Citizen’s 2021 Recovery Plan for the World, a year-long campaign to help end COVID-19 for all by raising money for the World Health Organisation’s vaccine-sharing program COVAX.
“Over the past year, our world has experienced pain, loss, and struggle — together,” concert campaign chairs Harry and Meghan, 39, said in a statement on their website. “Now we need to recover and heal — together. We can’t leave anybody behind. We will all benefit, we will all be safer, when everyone everywhere has equal access to the vaccine. We must pursue equitable vaccine distribution, and in that, restore faith in our common humanity. This mission couldn’t be more critical or important.”
Prince Harry has thrown another bomb at the Royal Family, saying he did not want to inherit Prince Charles’ “genetic pain” and that he felt “helpless”.
The Duke of Sussex launched a stunning attack on his family in his latest interview, but one line is particularly problematic for the Queen.

Sky News host Alan Jones says the federal government is likely preventing the public from seeing documents pertaining to the economic cost of COVID-19 because “it’s embarrassing”.

The Morrison government has classified 38 documents into the economic cost of various COVID-19 restrictions as cabinet documents, preventing them from being made publicly available.

“I think the response to the coronavirus in many ways was out of all proportion to the nature of the problem,” Mr Jones said.

Discussing the decision by government in relation to the documents, Mr Jones said he thinks “the one simple answer to that is most probably it’s embarrassing.”

UNSW finance professor Dr Peter Swan says the government knows the “highly secret reports” into the cost of COVID-19 lockdowns are “very bad and very revealing”.

The Morrison government has classified a series of 38 documents into the economic cost of various COVID-19 restrictions as cabinet documents, preventing them from being made publicly available.

Dr Swan told Sky News the government knew “how damaging” these reports were which was why it decided to hide them.

“How many hundreds-of-billions of dollars have been lost unnecessarily, tens-of-thousands of jobs, and businesses closed as a result of unnecessary lockdowns,” he said.

“I’m sure the government knows but it wants to keep it a secret. They must presumably be very very bad and very revealing.”

More than 75 eateries including McDonald’s, Hungry Jack’s and Nando’s have been added to the COVID-19 location list in one state.
More than 75 food businesses in Perth were visited by COVID-affected delivery drivers over a period of two days.
McDonald’s, Hungry Jack’s, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, Subway, Chicken Treat, The Coffee Club and KFC were among the popular eateries listed by the Health Department.
“There are about 100 different locations that WA Health advised are very low risk,” Premier Mark McGowan told reporters on Monday.
“People to whom food was delivered are required to get tested. They are considered a casual contact.
“If you were in one of the restaurants from which the food was picked up … you are encouraged to get tested.
“If symptoms develop for anyone who has been to any of these locations, they must get tested immediately.”
The delivery drivers were housemates of a quarantine hotel security guard who contracted the US strain of the virus from a returned traveller.
Among the listed venues was Vietnamese restaurant Basil & Mint in Greenwood, which is now closed while staff get tested.
“We are going to close our store for a couple of days to make sure everyone is safe and comfortable,” management wrote on social media.
“As the wellbeing of our staff and customers, we have advised all of our staff getting Covid tested. No customers were present at the time.
“We shall reopen our restaurant very soon when it’s safe and clear, as requested by the WA public Health Department.
“We are just doing the right things, keep updating, and looking forward to serving you again soon.”
To all my lovely customers.  We are going to close our store for a couple of days to make sure everyone is safe and...

Financial support from cricket continues to help the COVID-19 crisis as big names defend the continuation of the Indian Premier League.
Australian cricket’s donations to the Indian COVID-19 crisis have topped $150,000 after Cricket Australia pledged $50,000 to help the “distressing” situation on the subcontinent.
It comes after star fast bowler Pat Cummins donated $50,000 from his own pocket and Test great Brett Lee pledged one Bitcoin, worth roughly $55,000, to help the dire situation.
Interim CA boss Nick Hockley said the governing body’s contribution, in conjunction with the Australian Cricketers Association, was hopefully the start of a bigger contribution.
“Australians and Indians share a special bond and, for many, our mutual love of cricket is central to that friendship,” Hockley said.
“It has been distressing and saddening to learn of the suffering of so many of our Indian sisters and brothers during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, and our hearts go out to everyone impacted.
“We were all deeply moved by the sentiments expressed and donations given by Pat Cummins and Brett Lee over the past week.
Brilliant work @BrettLee_58 ðð¼#WeAreInThisTogetherhttps://t.co/6sY6tiCzyE
“In that same spirit, we are proud to partner with UNICEF Australia to raise funds that will help the people of India by providing the health system with much-needed oxygen, testing equipment and vaccines.”
There are still 36 Australian cricketers, coaches and commentators in India for the Indian Premier League, including Test stars Steve Smith and Dave Warner.
Plans for them to return to Australia at the end of the tournament remain up in the air after a travel ban was put in place by the federal government, banning any entries from India until at least May 15.
Former Test opener Michael Slater left India and travelled to the Maldives where he will wait until the ban ends, while Australian players AJ Tye, Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa have already returned home from the IPL
Amid criticism of the IPL continuing while India struggles to cope with coronavirus, national coach Ravi Shastri defended the tournament and said it was the “best thing happening”.
“The IPL is not taking oxygen cylinders from hospitals,” Shastri told SEN’s Gerard Whateley.
“Nor are they asking for any drugs or hospital beds. You must remember everyone in the IPL is in a bubble and are not playing in front of crowds.
“I say to people, ‘Tell me what type of damage it is doing compared to the smile it is putting on people’s faces?’”
The IPL runs until the end of May.
Australia’s highest-profile cricketers have been stuck in limbo since the Indian travel ban but could be among the first citizens to return home.

A ‘working theory’ has gone some way to explain how an Australian quarantine hotel security guard contracted the US strain of COVID-19.
A quarantine hotel security guard who contracted COVID-19 did not pick up the virus as a result of poor ventilation, according to the West Australian health minister.
The “working theory” is that the virus spread from a US traveller to another traveller from Indonesia and the security guard.
Health Minister Roger Cook told reporters on Monday that the traveller from Indonesia was on the same floor at the Pan Pacific Hotel as the person from the US and they arrived in Perth on the same day.
“Security guards are kept away from the doors of any rooms where we know we have positive travellers, but in this particular case the security guard was required to be in the proximity of the lift,” Mr Cook said.
He said it was possible the virus was transferred that way, but stressed it was not a ventilation issue, adding that had been ruled out as a possibility by authorities.
“We believe that both the traveller from Indonesia and US were infectious when they went into the hotel so there’s some other movement which actually led to it,” he said.
Asked if it was possible the virus was transferred on the bus ride to the hotel, Mr Cook said that was a potential theory.
“But we’re really just making sure that we look at all the CCTV footage that we have, as well as the epidemiological evidence that we have, to get a better understanding,” he said.
Premier Mark McGowan said the travellers were on the same flight to Perth, so the virus might have spread on the plane.
Three new cases of COVID-19 were recorded in hotel quarantine overnight, but there were no new local transmissions in the state.
Western Australia narrowly avoided another lockdown after the hotel security guard and two of his housemates contracted the virus.
Authorities have identified 58 close contacts, of which 26 have so far tested negative. Seventeen contacts came from a cooking class.
Of the 217 casual contacts, 43 have so far tested negative.
Mr McGowan said a separate list of locations would be added to the public exposure locations list, relating to venues where two infected food delivery drivers picked up and dropped off food.
There are about 100 locations that are considered very low risk and people who had food delivered to them must get tested.
People who were at the restaurants are also encouraged to get tested.
Mr McGowan said the current restrictions were expected to expire on Friday night, but the situation would be reviewed throughout the week.

Meanwhile, Mr McGowan, 53, and Mr Cook, 55, have received the Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
The coronavirus jab is now available for everyone over the age of 50.
Mr McGowan previously said he would not jump ahead of the queue to get the vaccine and would instead wait until he was eligible.
Asked how he was feeling after the needle went in, Mr McGowan joked: “Has she done it yet?”
The Premier said he “didn’t feel a thing”.
He later told reporters it “wasn’t a difficult experience” and urged people to get the jab.

People can get the jab at the state-run community vaccination clinics or wait until May 17 to get it at their GP clinic.
The state-run metropolitan community clinics are located at the Claremont Showgrounds, Kwinana Supa Centre and near Perth Airport at 2 George Wiencke Drive.
A fourth community vaccination clinic is scheduled to open later this month in Joondalup.
In regional Western Australia, hospital-based vaccination clinics are offering vaccinations in the Goldfields, Great Southern, Kimberley, Mid West, Pilbara, South West and Wheatbelt regions in addition to some local GP clinics.

Almost a third of the country is now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine – but the availability will depend on where you live.
Eight million Australians are now eligible to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine as the federal government ramps up the rollout of national immunisation against COVID-19.
Australians aged over 50 have been brought forward in the government’s vaccine timeline as part of phase 2a.
From Monday, over 50s can get the jab at commonwealth-run respiratory clinics and state and territory-run vaccination centres, which are the first to offer AstraZeneca vaccines under phase 2a.
From May 17, over 50s will be able to receive the AstraZeneca at participating general practitioners (GPs).
Phase 2a includes adults over 50, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults aged between 18-49 and “other critical and high-risk workers”.
Australia’s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said concerns over rare blood clotting from the AstraZeneca jab for under 50s had freed up a large number of doses for over 50s.
That led to national cabinet’s April 22 decision to move forward phase 2a.
“Clearly, we have to encourage Australians to get vaccinated; we have to make sure that we have a program that is credible,” he said last month.
“The AstraZeneca vaccine is the vaccine for people 50 years and over. Because the states and territories will be no longer providing AstraZeneca to under 50s in their clinics, that will free up more AstraZeneca to go to primary care sites.”
While approximately eight million Australians over 50 are eligible, receiving the AstraZeneca jab may depend on what state you live in.
Victorians can book an appointment at one of the state-run centres or walk into one but that will require a wait. They can also phone 1800 675 398 to make an appointment.
However, New South Wales health officials have said they will focus on priority groups at state-run centres from May 3.
NSW’s capacity will rise significantly once its mass vaccination centre opens at Sydney Olympic Park in mid-May.
Only those at risk will be offered an appointment, and the vaccine will not be available to all residents aged over 50 in the state-run centres.
To find out if and when you can receive a vaccine, use the federal government’s eligibility tracker.
Also beginning on Monday, state-run facilities whose refrigeration capacity qualifies to store the Pfizer vaccine will be able to offer it to Australians aged under 50 who are eligible in phases 1a and 1b.
The changes from Monday leaves the remainder of phases 2a, 2b and 3 waiting to receive the Pfizer jab.
Phase 2b includes the rest of the population aged between 16-49.

The state’s top doctor has called for a major overhaul of the hotel quarantine system and labelled the India ban as ‘un-Australian’.
Western Australia’s top doctor has taken aim at the state’s “hopeless” quarantine system after a security guard contracted COVID-19 and inadvertently infected two of his housemates, including a delivery driver.
Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller said he did not have confidence in the system and has also labelled the federal government’s move to deny stranded Australians the right to return home from India as “absolutely unacceptable”.
Contact tracers are yet to reveal how the worker contracted the virus, but so far Perth has avoided another snap lockdown. Dr Miller said it was time for an overhaul of the state’s system.
“We have shown it travels down hallways a lot further than 1.5m, and surgical masks are inadequate for workers and guests who might be near people who are COVID positive,” he told the Today show.
“We have to be thinking about the future and how we can prevent airborne disease spreading around as easily as it does now.
“We only have 30 positive cases in our system out of 2100, and that has been enough to cause the whole thing to shut down, and we can’t have people coming back from India which is a complete disgrace.
It is not a quarantine system. It is a hopeless system.”
When asked whether he agreed with Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the system was “overworked” and needed a rest, Dr Miller said a true quarantine system “should be able to have thousands of people with the disease (in it) and it not be a problem”.
“If you can’t run a system where less than 2 per cent of your people have COVID and still keep it out of the community, it is not quarantine,” he said.
Dr Miller said the system was also failing Australians stranded in India after the federal government introduced new legislation on the weekend that could fine or jail people should they come back within the next two weeks.
“I think once people see beyond their own fear of the disease, they will understand that these are the people who are suffering because we haven’t got our act together on quarantine or vaccine in this country,” he said.
“They are the ones paying the price for us now … our fellow Australians who have been trapped overseas for quite some time.
“We have to look after our own. It is not Australian to trap people overseas. It is absolutely unacceptable and outrageous.”
Dr Miller said he wanted to apologise to Indian-Australians that “those of us who have a voice in this were not able to stop that particular decision from happening”.
“I’m really sorry,” he added.

Coronavirus restrictions have been tightened in Perth as Premier Mark McGowan seeks to avoid another lockdown.

No new COVID-19 infections have been recorded and all high-risk close contacts of the three positive cases announced on Saturday have tested negative.

Perth nightclubs have been ordered to close immediately and spectators were banned from yesterday's AFL local derby.

Mr McGowan said he did not want to impose another lockdown but warned he would if the health advice suggested it was the best way forward.

Meanwhile, the travel bubble between New Zealand and Western Australia has been reinstated after it was paused due to the three positive cases in WA.

A COVID-19 test almost kept gun forward Harry McKay out of Carlton’s win over Essendon at the MCG on Sunday afternoon.
After waking up with a “24-hour bug” on Sunday, Harry McKay had to pass a COVID-19 test in time to play a key role in Carlton’s impressive comeback victory over Essendon at the MCG.
The young key forward had a quiet first half, but finished with a wet sail as he banged home four goals in the second to help the Blues execute a 37-point turnaround.
“I think it’s just a bit of gastro, nothing too bad,” Carlton coach David Teague said.
“He just woke up and he wasn’t feeling great and we had the conversation and he said, ‘Nah, I think I can get the job done for the team to a level we need’, and obviously he’s been in great form.
“He hit the scoreboard, gave us a contest and he’s a very hard man to defend because of his speed and height.
“I was super proud of Harry’s game … didn’t complain, didn’t tell any of his teammates, just went out there and kept competing.”
But the Blues didn’t escape the match unscathed with Mitch McGovern injuring his hamstring late and Paddy Dow having to be subbed out due to an eye injury which severely impaired his vision.
“I went up to him and he just shook his head, so he’s pretty disappointed,” Teague said of McGovern, who will likely miss multiple weeks.
It’s unclear as to whether Dow will be fit to face the Western Bulldogs next week, but Zac Williams (soreness) and Marc Murphy (neck) are good chances to return.
Carlton dasher Adam Saad was roundly booed all game by Essendon supporters in his first game against his old side, and the sound was music to Teague’s ears.
“I loved the boos because they were quite regular so it meant he was getting the ball a bit,” Teague said of Saad, who was one of Carlton’s best players.
Blues captain Patrick Cripps wasn’t overly influential in the first three quarters, but saved his best for last with a superb final term.
“At three-quarter time … he looked at me and said, ‘I’ve got this’, and when your leader does that, the way he played the last quarter (was great) and he’s a very important player to us,” Teague said.
After being jumped by the Bombers in the first 45 minutes to trail by 21 points, Teague said the Blues were able to change things up simply by defending better and subsequently becoming more potent in their attacking half.
Carlton won’t have to wait long to test their wares against the AFL’s best teams again. After being beaten by Richmond, Port Adelaide and the Brisbane Lions already in the first six weeks, they have the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne to look forward to over the next fortnight.
“We love those games and we want to play in those games,” Teague said.
“I think we’ve played three of the top four from last year and we haven’t got the job done so that’s our next step as a group.
“From a defensive point of view to beat these teams you can’t give them too many looks and we’ve got to get better.
“But I’m really confident if we play near our best … we can beat the Bulldogs or beat Melbourne.
“Our best is good enough to beat anyone, the challenge is going out there and executing under pressure.”
The son of a premiership Crow and a new member of the Crows’ SANFL side are among Adelaide’s possible mid-season draft targets.
The AFL has unveiled the fixture for rounds 13-15 of the 2021 season, which is set to include three Thursday night blockbusters.

Western Australia’s recent outbreaks were “all preventable” but Premier Mark McGowan was “dodging some of the responsibility,” according to Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid.

Three new cases of COVID-19 confirmed over the weekend were hotel quarantine workers who had spent time in the community following their infection.

It came after the premier plunged the Perth and Peel regions into a snap three-day lockdown over one case confirmed over the Anzac Day weekend.

Dr Khorshid said what was already known about the virus and how to run hotel quarantine meant the outbreaks were all preventable.

“WA seems to think when things go wrong, they don’t need to make changes; that’s a very disappointing attitude,” he said.

Dr Khorshid said the recent outbreaks coming out of hotel quarantine clearly showed there needed to be a national conversation about the future of quarantine.

“We’re going to need it for years, and now is the time to start building the appropriate facilities around the country,” he said.

“The federal government doesn’t seem interested at this stage. I hope the Western Australian government doesn’t feel it’s off the hook just by pointing the finger at the federal government.

“There is no doubt that there is only one government responsible for the lockdown we just had in Perth and the ongoing restrictions.”

A Coles store and a cinema are among several new venues added to a growing list of COVID-19 exposure sites after another outbreak in Perth.
﻿Western Australia health officials have flagged a Coles and Event Cinemas among new public exposure sites after a Perth security guard contracted COVID-19 in hotel quarantine and spread the virus to two of his friends.
The man, aged in his 20s, tested positive to COVID-19, with two of seven people sharing the man’s house also returning positive results.
The guard had worked in the Pan Pacific Hotel on April 24, 25 and 26, on the same floor as two hotel quarantine residents who had tested positive to coronavirus.
Since then, WA Health have announced a number of new sites the Perth security guard and the two others visited while infectious.
Anyone who was at following locations during the specified times must get a COVID test and isolate at home until you receive a negative result.
It's believed the security guard was infectious in the community for four days.
The man’s household included two guests from Canberra, Mr McGowan said.
Other exposure sites announced on Saturday:

WA Premier Mark McGowan has made a call on whether the state will go back into lockdown after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive to COVID-19.
A security guard working in hotel quarantine in Perth has tested positive to COVID-19, with two of seven people sharing the man‘s house also returning positive results.
But the state will not go into lockdown “at this point”, Premier Mark McGowan said in a press conference on Saturday.
“But it’s possible this could change by tomorrow or the day after,” he said.
The security guard, a man in his twenties who lives in Nollamara, had already had his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, Mr McGowan said.
He had worked in the Pan Pacific Hotel on April 24, 25 and 26, during which time new arrivals were admitted to the hotel.
He worked on the same floor as two hotel quarantine residents who had tested positive to COVID-19.
“CCTV vision is being reviewed, however there is no clear explanation at this point as to how the security guard could have been infected,” Mr McGowan said.
“It is possible transmission could have occurred while the international arrivals were admitted into hotel quarantine and possibly were transferred to their rooms.
“This is being investigated further.”
The man’s household included two guests from Canberra, Mr McGowan said.
He said the man visited several locations in the community while likely to have been infectious, including a Northlands shopping centre, a Coles, a cafe and a mosque.
The full list of locations will be uploaded to the WA government website.
They currently include:

Queensland Health has confirmed a cafe and toilets at the airport have been identified as potential exposure sites linked to a transiting passenger who tested positive to COVID-19. Here is all the latest information.
New information has recently surfaced from Queensland Health regarding the COVID-19-19 breach at Brisbane International Airport involving two people from PNG, one of which has tested positive for the virus.Queensland Health has confirmed a cafe and toilets at the airport have been identified as potential exposure sites linked to a transiting passenger who tested positive to COVID-19.
Queensland Health said people need to isolate and get tested if they had been to the following locations:
Hudson’s Coffee stand and the adjacent seating area between the coffee stand and the white barriers between 9.53am and 11.20am on Thursday, April 29 or the male toilets adjacent to Gate 79 between 11.23am and 11.15pm on Thursday, April 29.
These areas were visited by a man who tested positive after he and his travel partner were mistakenly directed to the international terminal’s green zone after arriving from Papua New Guinea, a high-risk country.
They were transiting to Doha.
Deputy chief health officer Dr Sonya Bennett said anyone who had been in these areas at the times specified needed to quarantine and get tested on Tuesday, May 4, five days after their exposure.
“It is likely that all of these contacts will be in New Zealand and NZ’s public health authorities are providing similar advice to people,” she said.
“However, we need to make sure we capture any contacts who remain in Australia. Having viewed CCTV footage, we believe people who have been to these locations during the times of exposure face a potential risk.
“We need them to quarantine and get tested five days after visiting these locations. That is the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 so if they are negative, they will be safe to leave quarantine.
“This is precautionary but we are taking no chances.”
Serology tests revealed the man likely to have been at a late stage of his infection, meaning he posed a low risk to other passengers at the airport. He and his travel partner were appropriately masked and socially distanced while in the green zone, outside of visiting the exposure sites.
The three flights affected are Air New Zealand NZ202 from Brisbane to Christchurch, Air New Zealand NZ146 from Brisbane to Auckland, and Qantas QF135 from Brisbane to Christchurch.

A high-profile doctor who endorsed controversial treatments for coronavirus has died in hospital after contracting the virus.
A doctor in Kenya who advised citizens against getting vaccinated has died from coronavirus.
Stephen Karanja, who served as the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association chairman, advised mask-wearing and mass testing as the most effective ways to stamp out the pandemic, clashing with local bishops who have been urging Kenyans to get inoculated.
The Catholic Health Comission reported the controversial doctor — whose age is not publicly known — was admitted to hospital last week before succumbing to the respiratory disease on April 29.
Dr Karanja remained staunch the current global rollout of the fast-tracked vaccine was “totally unnecessary, making the motivation suspect”.
He instead endorsed alternative treatments for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine and the hotly-debated Ivermectin.
“There are drugs that have been repurposed and used effectively to treat Covid-19,” he said in a March statement.
“We advise that a COVID-19 vaccine is unnecessary and should not be given. We appeal to all the people of Kenya to avoid taking it.”
Kenyan Roman Catholic Bishop Philip Anyolo openly opposed the doctor’s claim, insisting the rollout is being carried out in a “objective and well-co-ordinated manner” in Kenya.

“It should be noted that those doctors cannot and should not purport to speak in the name of the Catholic Church. We, the Catholic bishops in Kenya, avail our vast network of healthcare facilities to be utilised to ensure the vaccination is rolled out in an objective and well-co-ordinated manner,” Mr Anyolo said via Kenyan news outlet Tuko.
WHO attempted to dispel concerns raised by Dr Karanja in March, stressing to the public the vaccine had been rigorously reviewed and deemed safe by “stringent regulatory authorities”.
Dr Karanja had a history of controversy over his opinions on public health issues and vaccination campaigns, publicly opposing the vaccination of schoolgirls against cervical cancer in 2019.
Dr Karanja said the jab against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) was unnecessary because it affected those “whose lifestyle involves irresponsible sexual behaviours”.
He was also a strong anti-abortion campaigner, appearing in court to testify against the government changing of abortion guidelines in 2018.
In 2014, he gained attention after declaring a nationwide rollout of a tetanus vaccination, claiming it was a sterilising campaign against women.

Debate rages in Africa over Ivermectin
Ivermectin is a medication used to treat many types of parasite infestations including head lice and scabies.
Its effectiveness in treating coronavirus is currently under hot debate between medical professionals and politicians globally.
In April 2020, Australian researchers published results from a laboratory experiment suggesting Ivermectin could stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from multiplying in animal cells under a microscope.
“This discovery was exciting, however even the researchers themselves have cautioned that this one study is not enough to prove the medicine will work against COVID-19 in humans,” NPS MedicineWise said in an article detailing new information on ivermectin.
Independent MP Craig Kelly attracted attention online this month over his endorsement of the treatment before having his Facebook account banned for “repeated spreading of misinformation”.
WHO officials believe results on Ivermectin’s effectiveness are still inconclusive after conducting 16 randomised trials with a panel of independent clinical experts.
“They determined that the evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of “very low certainty,” the WHO’s official statement read.
The debate over ivermectin is currently roaring in South Africa, where demand for the drug -- which is only registered to treat parasites in animals -- has inflated the price fifteen fold after a number doctors began prescribing it in mid-2020.
Professor Nathi Mdladla, head of the intensive care unit at Durban‘s George Mukhari Academic Hospital, said the demand for medical practitioners to try alternative treatments grew incredibly quickly with bodies piling up during the peak of the pandemic.
“The fight is about the quality of the studies that have been done so far. What we‘re saying is that in a pandemic, you can never be in a position to actually generate these high-level, long studies, because it means in the meantime, you watch people die,” Dr Mdladla said.
But South African critical care specialist Rietze Rodseth says the evidence is simply too weak for high-ranking public health officials to endorse.
“I‘m quite surprised by everybody’s petitioning and going on about the wonders of this drug. The evidence base and quality of the studies done so far are pretty weak. We simply do not have enough evidence to say: ’Yes this works.’” he told the BBC.
In Australia, ivermectin is an approved treatment for scabies, the tropical diseases onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis, and a skin condition called rosacea.

Additional pallets of oxygen cylinders were packaged to leave Travis Air Force Base in California on April 28, headed for India, where a second wave of coronavirus has seen hospitals struggle. The White House said the US would supply India with more than $100 million worth of “urgent relief.” Officials said aid flights would begin arriving in India on April 29, carrying, besides oxygen, personal protective equipment (PPE), vaccine manufacturing supplies, and rapid diagnostic tests. The US Department of Defense shared footage of the “brand-new, high-quality supplies” in the 60th Aerial Port Squadron Warehouse at the base in Solano County, California. Officials said the donation of 440 oxygen cylinders and regulators, one million N-95 masks, and one million COVID-19 rapid diagnostic kits would be transported to India aboard a US Air Force C-5M Super Galaxy.

The accused, Mantu and Rocky, were arrested a day after the alleged gang rape and are behind bars in the Malsalami police station.
“They have been booked under 376D and the investigation is on,” a police source said.
“We would also see whether they have been involved before in any case or not.”

The duo allegedly took the girl to a deserted house and took turns raping her for an hour before fleeing from the spot.
The alleged victim (name withheld) said: “I begged before them to set me free, but they behaved like beasts and started touching my private parts. Before I could show some resistance they slapped me repeatedly.
“They took me to a house and started grabbing me.
“Before I could try to run away from the spot they tied my legs and hands to cover my mouth with a hanky.”

The frightened girl managed to free herself and reached home where she told her parents about the horrific incident. They then called the police.
The duo confirmed persuading the girl with the promise of a COVID vaccine at one of Patna’s health facilities.
Police were working to verify the teen’s age, with a possibility of adding more charges against the two men from Jamunapur village.
“If she happens to be below 18, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act will also take place in the charge sheet against the criminals,” the investigation officer maintained.
Bihar has recorded a total number of 441,000 cases since the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2021.
On April 28 the registration for the second phase of the mega vaccination drive kicked off — and citizens above the age of 18 will get a jab from May 1.
So far, 2391 deaths were reported in the state which has also witnessed a surge in the death rate since the double mutant virus was identified in India.
Health industry experts have also warned India is going to face a vaccine shortage from May 1, given the demand of the tens of thousands of beneficiaries.
As of now, the country has access to 70 million doses of Covishield monthly, apart from 20 million doses of Covaxin.

Queensland has introduced an extremely strict new coronavirus rule that could have huge implications for people who have left the state.
Anyone in Queensland who has visited an exposure site in another state must go into quarantine for 14 days, the state’s chief health officer Jeannette Young announced on Friday.
The extreme move was made “to protect the health and safety of Queensland residents, and interstate travellers that come into Queensland”, she said.
The new directive means:
All people are encouraged to monitor the Queensland Health interstate exposure venue lists for 14 days after they arrive in the state to ensure no new venues have been added. This includes venues in New Zealand.
Interstate exposure sites are listed on each state health website and include several restaurants in Western Australia, Terminal 1 of Melbourne Airport, Bunnings and a food court in Auckland.
Dr Young said anyone with symptoms, no matter how mild, should come forward and get tested straight away.
“Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, and loss of taste or smell,” she said.
“As we’ve seen over the past couple of weeks, we’re still in this pandemic and we can’t be complacent.
“It is critical we detect any cases that we may not be aware of as quickly as possible through our testing system.”

A 60-year-old returned traveller who tested positive to the virus has been put in ICU and is requiring oxygen in South Australia.
A returned traveller who tested positive for COVID-19 has been transferred to an Adelaide hospital intensive care unit.
SA Health confirmed the man, in his 60s, was transferred from the Toms Court medi-hotel to The Royal Adelaide Hospital overnight.
It comes as the state records two new positive cases of the virus in hotel quarantine, including a male in his 30s and a second male in his 40s.
SA Health deputy chief medical officer Emily Kirkpatrick said the man was in a stable condition.
“He is requiring some oxygen and I understand he’ll be moved to the ward later,” Dr Kirkpatrick said.
“Our thoughts are with him and we hope he makes a speedy recovery.”
It’s the second COVID-infected person in the state to have been admitted to intensive care.

Australians could get the COVID-19 jab earlier, as a critical stage of the vaccine rollout is pushed forward.
Australians above the age of 50 will be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has revealed.
Phase 2a of the vaccine rollout will be brought forward to next week for people aged 50 and over, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders adults, and any critical or high risk workers who have not already been vaccinated.
“Already over 400 (GP practices) will be opening next week, so we will have 136 general practice respiratory clinics, commonwealth clinics opening next week,” Mr Hunt told reporters on Friday afternoon.
“They are bringing forward the phase 2a … it’s more opportunity for Australians to be vaccinated earlier.”
It follows a national cabinet meeting where the state premiers discussed the coronavirus vaccine as well as border concerns with India.
The subcontinent is plagued with coronavirus infections, posting a daily rise in cases of 386,452 on Friday, while deaths from the virus jumped by 3498 in the past 24 hours.
“The briefing I have had is very clear that the focus of that (national cabinet) is to make sure that we are keeping Australians safe at a time of an expanded global pandemic,” Mr Hunt said.
“The figures we know are reaching extraordinary levels, and so we have put the pause on the flights from India, but in particular, the Prime Minister and national cabinet were focused on making sure we have a pathway for repatriation flights from India to begin as soon as possible, after May 15, once we have seen a reduction in the number of cases.”

Heartbreaking photos captured the moment an Indian woman desperately tried to save her COVID-19 infected husband after being refused entry to a hospital.
Helpless bystanders witnessed a heartbreaking scene in India as a woman desperately tried to save her COVID-19 infected husband’s life.
Renu Singhal, 45, a resident of Awas Vikas Sector 7 in Agra of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, desperately gave her husband Ravi Singhal, 47, CPR in an auto-rickshaw just metres from a packed medical centre
As Renu knew her husband could die any moment and, with no oxygen cylinder available, she took it upon herself to try and save her husband’s life.
The rickshaw was parked outside a government health facility that Renu had hoped would have oxygen when Ravi’s condition rapidly deteriorated.

RELATED: COVID victim’s terrifying final words
Upon seeing this Renu screamed for help but with the nearby facility already overflowing with COVID-19 patients it turned out to be a futile exercise, leaving her with no option but to try mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
“I looked for help but there was no one around who could have wheeled in my husband as he was unable to move,” Renu said.
The grief-stricken Renu tried everything possible to keep her husband alive. At one moment she would give her CPR before clutching a bottle and sprinkling water over Ravi, pleading with him to hold on.
“I’ve no one else Ravi, please do not leave me alone,” a panicked Renu told her husband who was gasping for breath.
Renu’s desperate attempts went in vain as Ravi passed away in her arms. Later, Renu also got confirmation from Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC) where doctors pronounced Ravi as dead.

Renu was distraught and held her husband in her lap while hoping against hope that Ravi would open his eyes, but her efforts couldn’t revive him.
“My husband was in home isolation and was suffering from high-grade fever and he complained of breathing problems. I walked out of the home to get him treated in the hospital. I tried helpline numbers but unfortunately, they failed to respond and I took help from an auto-rickshaw driver to take him to different hospitals in the city,” Renu said.
Before turning to the last resort, Renu single-handedly took her husband to at least four different hospitals. And on reaching SN Medical College, she found the hospital was already at capacity, which forced Renu to breathe into the mouth of her unconscious husband.
“However, I was told bring an oxygen cylinder and he would be admitted as visibly they had no oxygen left,” Renu said.
Despite failing to revive her husband, Renu has set an example of courage in unprecedented times.
RELATED: India’s COVID crisis threatens ‘whole world’
Across India, the refusal from hospitals to admit patients has witnessed a surge due to the unavailability of beds. Subsequently, it has forced people to take desperate measures, with many putting out pleas on social media for help.
Crematoriums across the country have also been overwhelmed by the new wave of illness, with facilities forced to spill out into parking lots in order to keep up with the growing number of coronavirus victims.
Haunting photographs have captured families carrying the bodies of their loved ones through the mass cremation sites, with pyres burning around them.
Over past three days, India has reported more than a million COVID-19 infections, which have subsequently overburdened its underdeveloped healthcare institutions.
The second wave of infections has seen most hospitals have run out of oxygen, leading to the deaths of thousands of patients.
On Thursday, India’s daily numbers of COVID-19 cases reached a grim new record, with 379,257 fresh infections and 3645 deaths.
The total number infections across the country has topped 18 million, with more than 204,000 deaths since the pandemic began. However, there are concerns the true figured could be much higher that what is being reported.
The World Health Organisation has announced India is dealing with a “double mutant” strain of the virus called B. 1.617.
WHO recently listed the B. 1.617 mutation as a “variant of interest” but stopped short of declaring it a “variant of concern”, which would label it as more transmissible or deadly than the original.
There is also concern this variant may be combining with other easily spread variants, which could be playing a roll in the record number of cases across India.
“Indeed, studies have highlighted that the spread of the second wave has been much faster than the first,” the WHO said.

A year ago, a cemetery operator in COVID-ravaged Brazil described his “nightmare”. But 12 months later it is worse than he ever imagined.
In April last year, a cemetery operator in COVID-ravaged Brazil described his “nightmare”. Fast forward 12 months and it is much worse.
Last year, at the start of the pandemic, Manual Viana, who looks after the burials of Brazilians at the Nossa Senhora Aparecida cemetery in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, described what it was like to have to dig mass graves for those who did not survive the first wave of coronavirus.
“I just wish a helicopter would come and fly me away from here,” he told Washington-based non-profit media company NPR at the time. “We are living through a nightmare.”
He said the use of heavy machinery to dig mass graves capable of holding multiple coffins was “the only option” because it was “humanly impossible” to stay on top of the rising death toll by hand.
Now, 12 months on, pictures from Mr Viana’s cemetery show graves are being dug in streets because there are no remaining plots to bury the dead.

It is just one sign of Brazil’s ongoing struggle to cope with the pandemic as the country’s death toll surpassed 400,000 on Thursday. It is just the second country to reach the grim milestone after the United States.
Surge in cases pushes health care system to brink of collapse
The country’s health ministry reported 3001 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing Brazil’s overall toll to 401,186.
With a population of 212 million, the South American nation also has one of the highest mortality rates in the pandemic, at 189 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants – the worst in the Americas and one of the top 15 worldwide.
Brazil has been devastated by a surge in cases since the start of the year that pushed hospitals to the brink of collapse in many areas.
Although it appears to have passed the peak of the new wave, the number of daily deaths remains staggeringly high, at an average of 2526 a day over the past week, behind only India.
Experts blame the latest surge partly on the “Brazil variant” of the virus, a mutation that emerged in or around the city of Manaus in December.
The pandemic has now claimed 400,000 lives in Brazil. About one in every 500 Brazilians has died of covid-19.
RELATED: Horror images show Brazil on its knees
Known as P1, the variant can reinfect people who have had the original strain of the virus, and may be more contagious.
“P1 has had a very big impact. Nothing was done to contain the variant when there was a spike in January in Manaus. It was only a matter of time before it swept across Brazil,” said epidemiologist Ethel Maciel of Espirito Santo Federal University.
P1 is now circulating in 54 countries, according to the World Health Organisation, which labels it a “variant of concern,” along with the British and South African strains.
Vaccine shortages impact an already struggling nation
The country is meanwhile struggling with vaccine shortages.
Around 28 million people in Brazil have received a first COVID-19 vaccine dose, just over 13 per cent of the population. About 12.7 million have received their second dose.
But cities in 14 of Brazil’s 27 states have had to suspend second doses because of shortages.
In a small piece of good news, the first million doses of the Pfizer vaccine were due to arrive Thursday evening, adding to Brazil’s two current options, the AstraZeneca vaccine and Chinese-developed CoronaVac.
Bolsonaro investigated over handling of health crisis
On Tuesday, the Senate opened an investigation into whether there was criminal neglect in President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic.
The far-right president has controversially downplayed the virus, fought stay-at-home measures to contain it and rejected offers of various vaccines – including, initially, Pfizer’s.
But Mr Bolsonaro refused to accept any blame over the country’s health crisis, telling supporters: “I was wrong about nothing.”
The President argues the economic damage of measures such as a national lockdown would cause more suffering than the virus itself.
But the commission’s rapporteur vowed to hold officials accountable for mishandling the crisis.
Senators will be investigating, among other things, horrific scenes such as those that unfolded earlier this year in Manaus, where dozens of COVID-19 patients suffocated to death due to oxygen shortages.
“The country has the right to know who contributed to these thousands of deaths, and they must be punished immediately,” said the rapporteur, Senator Renan Calheiros.
“There is no statute of limitations on crimes against humanity … We will wage a crusade against this agenda of death.”

Health authorities have revealed how an airport mishap allowed passengers into the wrong zone, potentially exposing almost 400 people to coronavirus.
An employee at Brisbane International Airport mistakenly directed a returned traveller, who later tested positive to COVID-19, into the wrong area where they mingled with passengers bound for New Zealand.
The airport was dubbed a “venue of concern” after it was revealed the passenger, who had travelled from Papua New Guinea, potentially exposed to the virus to 390 passengers who flew to New Zealand from Brisbane on three separate flights.
The infected man travelled from a “red zone” or high risk country but was inadvertently allowed to cross into the safe “green zone” area at Brisbane Airport, where passengers were waiting to travel to New Zealand.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young revealed the employee mistakenly directed the two travellers into the “green side” path at the airport instead of keeping them in the “red side”.
The infected man and a companion unintentionally spent two hours in the green zone on Thursday morning before they were escorted to their rightful area.
“It was just an error in terms of that staff member, which the Brisbane Airport Corporation has apologised,” Dr Young told reporters on Friday afternoon.
“Errors happen. We know they happen, which is why we have all of those other mitigating factors in place, and they all worked so it was picked up.”
Dr Young said the incident had not led to “any significant risk” and authorities had thoroughly investigated to ensure there were no problems.
The pair dined at Hudson Cafe for about 90 minutes before using the toilets and visiting a second retail outlet.
Staff at the cafe have been asked to isolate for two weeks, but Dr Young said other customers in the cafe did not need to because of the cafe’s open space.
Earlier on Friday, she declared the international terminal a venue of concern.
“Anyone who was in the terminal between 9.45am and midday on Thursday, 29 April 2021, should monitor their symptoms and get tested immediately if they feel unwell.
“Once the mistake was identified, the two passengers were tested for COVID-19.
“One man’s initial test was equivocal, meaning it was neither positive nor negative. Further testing revealed he is positive. The other passenger is negative.”
Dr Young said New Zealand authorities had been alerted to the error and the risk of Queenslanders becoming infected was low.
The three flights affected are Air New Zealand NZ202 from Brisbane to Christchurch, Air New Zealand NZ146 from Brisbane to Auckland, and Qantas QF135 from Brisbane to Christchurch.
“Staff who came into contact with this case have been placed into quarantine,” she said.
“We have advised the NZ Ministry of Health of the latest results, and they are taking their own protection measures.”
Two of todayâs new cases were detected in hotel quarantine. One case was detected in Brisbane Airportâs International Terminal. #covid19au
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk took to social media on Friday morning to confirm one of the passengers had tested positive to COVID-19.
The two passengers who arrived on Thursday morning into the red zone were let into the area designated for New Zealand arrivals due to “human error”, Brisbane Airport Corporation confirmed.
They were eventually found by airport staff and returned to the red zone. Three “green” flights departed within the two-hour period to New Zealand, potentially exposing 390 passengers to COVID-19.
The pair had returned negative results before leaving Port Moresby, but a second test on Thursday returned a “weak positive” for one of the travellers.
Dr Young earlier said the two passengers posed a low risk to others.
“While at the airport, they wore masks and socially distanced and neither has reported symptoms,” she said.
“They were in the wrong zone through no fault of their own, and we appreciate their patience and co-operation while we rule them out as cases.
“We’re also grateful for the prompt action by Brisbane Airport staff once the mistake was identified.”
On Thursday night the New Zealand Ministry of Health urged passengers who arrived on flights NZ202 (Brisbane to Christchurch), NZ146 (Brisbane to Auckland) and QF135 (Brisbane to Christchurch) to monitor their health for the next two weeks.
Queensland recorded two cases in hotel quarantine on Friday.

A record day of COVID019 cases has pushed India’s infections to 18 million. But many fear this number is hiding something much worse.
Days of record COVID-19 infections and deaths have seen India reach a grim milestone, with the country topping 18 million cases, but experts believe this figure is hiding a much worse crisis.
In the past three days India recorded one million infections, with the nation experiencing a new single-day record on Thursday after confirming 379,257 cases and 3645 deaths.
The country’s official COVID-19 figures stand at almost 18.4 million cases and 204,832 fatalities, though researchers and health workers have warned the true numbers are much higher.
Some experts have estimated the cases and deaths are likely between five and 10 times higher than what is being reported, while others believe it could be up to 30 times higher.
Scientists have been using serology surveys to get a more accurate measure of infection rates, with a previous national survey showing the number of cases in India is likely “20 to 30 times higher than what had been reported.
RELATED: COVID victim’s terrifying final words
RELATED: Unfolding virus crisis we’re overlooking
Applying this to India’s latest figures raises the estimated total infections for the country to 540 million cases, more than half a billion infections.
Director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi, Ramanan Laxminarayan, told CNN it was “widely known” the case numbers and death toll were being under-reported.
“Last year we estimated that only one in about 30 infections were being caught by testing, so the reported cases are a serious underestimate of true infections,” he said.
“This time, the mortality figures are probably serious underestimates, and what we’re seeing on the ground is many more deaths than what has been officially reported.”
Crematoriums and hospitals overflowing
The situation in crematoriums across the country is also pointing to a much higher death toll than what is being officially reported.
Mass cremations are taking place in multiple cities, with the facilities being forced to spill out into parking lots and on roads in order to keep up with the constant stream of COVID-19 victims.
There have been multiple reports of discrepancies in the numbers being reported by crematoriums and the number of cremations actually taking place.
On April 17, the state of Gujarat claimed 78 COVID-19 deaths but newspapers reported 689 cremations linked to the virus took place across seven of the state’s cities that same day.
Similar complaints have also surfaced in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Indian journalist Rana Ayyub described the country’s situation as “apocalyptic”.

Suresh Bhai, a worker at one of the large cremation grounds in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, told The New York Times he had been instructed by his bosses to write “sickness” instead of COVID-19 on the documentation handed over to families of victims.
The situation India’s hospitals is just as grim, with patients gasping for breath due to the serious undersupply of oxygen.
Families are being forced to put out plea for help on social media, begging for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders in an attempt to save their loved ones.
More than 40 countries have committed to sending vital medical aid to the country, however, the oxygen crisis is still expected to continue into mid-May.
India’s crisis a warning to the rest of the world
As the situation in India worsens, the World Health Organisation has issued a stark warning to countries thinking of easing COVID-19 restrictions.
Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin announced plans to lift lockdown restrictions starting May 10, including “vaccine bonus” perks for those who have had both jabs.
“Hope is returning,” Martin said.
Portugal said it would reopen its land border with Spain on Saturday.
In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city hopes to “fully reopen” on July 1.
And in France, cafes, cultural venues and business will reopen in several phases from next month, President Emmanuel Macron said.
WHO has warned relaxing restrictions too quickly could spark a “perfect storm” for a new wave of infections across the US and Europe.
“When personal protective measures are being relaxed, when there are mass gatherings, when there are more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low this can create a perfect storm in any country,” head of WHO Europe, Hans Kluge, told reporters Thursday.
“It is very important to realise that the situation in India can happen anywhere.”
‘Double mutant’ variant blamed as vaccines ramp up
India’s second wave has been blamed on a new “double mutant” COVID-19 variant called B. 1.617, with officials suggesting continued mass gatherings across the country are partly to blame for allowing the variant to spread so quickly.
WHO recently listed the B. 1.617 mutation as a “variant of interest” but stopped short of declaring it a “variant of concern”, which would label it as more transmissible or deadly than the original.
There is also concern this variant may be combining with other easily spread variants, which could be playing a roll in the record number of cases across India.
“Indeed, studies have highlighted that the spread of the second wave has been much faster than the first,” the WHO said.
The Indian government is planning to tackle this crisis by ramping up its vaccination program, announcing vaccinations will be open to all adults from Saturday. It had previously limited shots to the over-45s and certain other groups.
However, despite the country being home to the world’s largest vaccine producer, the Serum Institute of India, many states believe they won’t have enough stock to expand the rollout.
About 140 million of India’s 1.4 billion population has received a COVID-19 vaccine, with under two per cent of those receiving both doses.

A father’s harrowing last words before he died from COVID are revealed as death predictions in India worsen. WARNING: Distressing images
WARNING: Distressing images
A woman has shared the harrowing last words of her father as he died from coronavirus in India.
The country has been setting global record daily case numbers as devastating stories and images emerge from the epicentre and its surrounds. New Delhi is now reporting one death every four minutes.
Today is the eight-straight day of record figures and experts say that’s not likely to stop, as medical supplies dwindle and delayed safety measures have caused strife for containing the spread.
Figures are expected to continue to peak for the next few weeks as cases spiral.
Almost 400,000 new cases were confirmed yesterday, more than 30,000 above the 7-day average. At least 3600 people died in the last 24 hours, taking India’s total COVID-19 cases pass 18 million.
“India is still on an upward trajectory where the rate of infection is still moving at very fast and very horrifying rates at the moment,” ABC’s South Asia correspondent James Oaten said from New Delhi.

Barkha Dutt’s father was among the dead yesterday, with the Washington Post columnist telling CNN he died after the oxygen tank in the ambulance that was rushing him to hospital ran out.
“My father’s last words to me were: ‘I’m choking, please give me treatment’,” she said.
“I have nobody left, I feel alone.”
Ms Dutt said that despite being an “upper-middle class Indian who can pay for the best private medical treatment”, the shortage of supplies knew no bounds.
“By the time we reached hospital, he had to be taken into ICU. He never made it back.”
She said when the family went to cremate his body, “there was no space” and a there was a “physical fight that erupted between families”.
The spiking body count has overwhelmed crematoriums and graveyards, and caused a shortage of wood for funeral pyres.
Ms Dutt said she met families at cremation grounds where “bodies were lying on the floor”.
Horror prediction, gravediggers work
Experts suggest current data predicts deaths in India could peak at up to 14,000 a day.
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle has predicted that the death toll will continue to rise, peaking at almost 14,000 on May 16.
Director Dr Christopher Murray warned “there’s a lot of bad times ahead” for India as infections are close to their peak next week.
The Indian government has been criticised for its lacklustre handling of the spread of the virus, with political rallies and religious festivals allowed across the country.
It’s a blow for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who just months ago claimed the country had defeated the virus and concerns grow of the government’s level of transparency over official figures.
Dr Murray told CNN the appearance of new COVID-19 variants have increased transmission and meant that people could be reinfected with a new strain.
Meanwhile, gravediggers are “working around the clock”, doing 24-hour shifts in Mumbai to bury victims while hundreds more were being cremated in parks and car parks in New Delhi that have been converted to crematoriums.
‘Unprecedented situation’
A number of flights carrying medical supplies worth almost $130 million are en route to India after more than 40 countries, including Australia, committed to sending vital medical aid to the country, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said overnight.
|But many countries have come forward on their own to offer us assistance,” Mr Shringla said.
The supplies include almost 550 oxygen-generating plants, more than 4000 oxygen concentrators, 10,000 oxygen cylinders as well as 17 cryogenic tankers.
Hundreds of thousands of doses of COVID-19 treatment drugs remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, as well as raw materials to produce vaccines and remdesivir, were also being sent.
“It is an unprecedented situation … we are sourcing many of these items from many countries,” Mr Shringla said.
Oxygen supplies are among the most sought after supplies amid a severe shortage, but the equipment, sent from the United States, Europe and Singapore to name a few, is “really more a trickle than a flood compared to India’s huge population,” Mr Oaten said.
“This is a collapsed health care system and people just can’t get into hospitals,” he said.
Despite this, the Indian government will open vaccinations to all adults from Saturday. It had previously limited shots to the over-45s and certain other groups.
Several states have warned, however, that they do not have sufficient vaccine stocks and the expanded rollout is threatened by administrative bickering, confusion over prices and technical glitches on the government’s digital vaccine platform.
“The queues here are so colossal,” Jayanti Vasant told AFP as he waited at a busy vaccination centre in Bangalore.
“The people are just fighting amongst themselves.”

Footage from the doorstep of a hospital in India represents a new low for a nation ravaged by the coronavirus.
Video from King George Hospital in the southeastern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh shows a 16-month-old baby girl dying in the back of a van while her father desperately pumps oxygen into her lungs by hand.
Her mother screams and cries for help but no help comes. The little girl, who local reporters say tested positive for COVID-19, died 90 minutes after the video was recorded.
Filmmaker Uma Sudhim from Indian news media company New Delhi Television Ltd shared the distressing moments on Twitter.
“A mother wailing/pleading in front of King George Hospital asking for admission & treatment for her 16-month old baby girl who reportedly tested (positive for COVID-19); she says ‘we don’t want bed, just treat my baby’; baby died after 90 minutes at doorstep of (hospital),” she wrote.
“Father constantly pressing (ambulance) bag to keep his baby alive as he says baby first tested negative in rapid antigen test, then tested positive, she was denied treatment in hospitals & brought to biggest & govt hospital but died without treatment.”

The baby girl is one of a countless number of victims who have died outside hospitals while waiting for emergency care and oxygen as India’s healthcare system collapses under the weight of an unprecedented second wave.
India on Thursday recorded a new record rise in coronavirus cases with 379,257 and 3645 deaths, taking the country’s overall cases to 18 million.
India’s death toll also rose above 200,000 according to health ministry data, however, experts fear the actual death toll could be much higher.
Help is on its way in the form of $100 million in supplies from the US, including nearly one million instant tests.
The White House said the first lot would arrive on Thursday in New Delhi via a military plane, days after President Joe Biden promised to step up assistance to the emerging US ally.
The first shipment includes 960,000 rapid tests, which can detect COVID-19 in 15 minutes, and 100,000 N95 masks for frontline health workers.

The US is also sending 1000 refillable oxygen cylinders and 1700 concentrators that produce oxygen for patients from the air.
Nations have rushed supplies to India as it contends with one of the world’s most catastrophic surges of COVID-19 since the pandemic began, overwhelming hospitals and pushing crematoriums past capacity.
In the last week, India has recorded more than 300,000 new cases every day.
The problem with oxygen is very real, even though experts say the vast nation of 1.3 billion people is producing enough oxygen — just over 7000 tonnes a day. Most is for industrial use, but can be diverted for medical purposes.
The bottlenecks are in transport and storage.
Liquid oxygen at very low temperatures has to be transported in cryogenic tankers to distributors, which then convert it into gas for filling cylinders. But India is short of cryogenic tankers.
The government is importing mobile oxygen generation plants and tankers, building more than 500 new plants and buying portable oxygen concentrators.

An alarming statistic has shown how heavily the hotel sector has been hammered by COVID-19, and the industry is begging for help.
Hotel and accommodation operators have begged for help, claiming COVID-19 has slashed occupancy rates in CBDs by half.
Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Thursday also heard “anecdotal evidence” of significant job losses in the sector following the end of JobKeeper.
Tourism Accommodation Australia chief executive Michael Johnson said the industry had no federal or state safety net to help it cope with the impact of snap lockdowns.
“This has a devastating financial, emotional, and mental cost to businesses and workers,” he said.
“Many workers have found alternative employment in other industries less exposed to the impacts of COVID-19.”
Australia has enjoyed a strong economic recovery from COVID-19, and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday noted that 200,000 more people than initial estimates had found work.
But Mr Johnson said 15 per cent of workers in the hotel sector in NSW had been laid off since March, adding to the 25 per cent let go at the beginning of the pandemic.
Cuts had come mainly from administrative roles that operators could no longer justify, but the sector faced “dire” shortages in kitchen and frontline food skills, he said.
“So we’ve got this huge need for people. On the other side of it, we’ve had some highly skilled people that have left and gone to other industries,” he said.
Mr Johnson said in Sydney and Melbourne’s CBDs, which were heavily reliant on corporate travel, occupancy rates were around 50 per cent.
“The concern is that if (people) do travel and there is a shutdown, they then get restricted or placed into a quarantine environment,” he said.
“We’re still seeing a very, very slow recovery of corporate travel, and the corporate market makes up a huge proportion of our domestic travel.”
Australian Hotels Association ACT general manager Anthony Brierley said unemployment was at “virtually 100 per cent” in the sector at the beginning of the pandemic.
Mr Brierley said the federal government’s $80bn JobKeeper scheme had eased that pain but agreed there would be “significant job losses” after it ended last month.
“That’s the anecdotal evidence. I think the ABS data will bear that out in time,” he said.
He predicted unemployment would remain at roughly 11 per cent, equating to around 100,000 jobs.
Mr Brierley also warned that hotel operators’ fixed costs, including rent and mortgages, had returned to or exceeded their pre-pandemic levels.
Coupled with capacity limits, he said the situation for operators had become “unsustainable”.
“Our industry is being asked to do these things with only 50 per cent of its patrons. That’s not fair. It’s not sustainable in a financial sense,” he said.
Mr Brierley said targeted assistance from the federal government had previously worked to plug holes caused by snap lockdowns, but was that was no longer the case.
“There’s a breakdown there and our industry is caught in the middle of it, and people seem to be oblivious to the financial plight that comes with that,” he said.

India is struggling to provide oxygen vital for the treatment of seriously ill Covid-19 patients
A devastating surge in coronavirus infections has exposed India's dilapidated health infrastructure and a deep shortage of oxygen -- a key treatment for seriously ill Covid-19 patients.
AFP looks at the reasons behind the shortage:
Oxygen therapy is crucial for severe Covid-19 patients with hypoxaemia -- when oxygen levels in the blood are too low.
"This is why it is imperative to fix oxygen supply systems in hospital settings as this is a disease that affects lungs primarily."
But the government has for years failed to invest enough money into such infrastructure, experts say.
The short answer: yes.
The bottlenecks are in transport and storage.
But India is short of cryogenic tankers.
Most oxygen producers are in India's east, while the soaring demand has been in cities including financial hub Mumbai in the west and the capital Delhi in the north.
Meanwhile, many hospitals do not have on-site oxygen plants, often because of poor infrastructure, a lack of expertise and high costs.
- What's being done? -
Industries have been ordered by the government not to use liquid oxygen.
The military has also been mobilised to transport tankers and other supplies domestically and from international sources.
- What's happening on the ground? -

Meanwhile, there is a growing black market for cylinders and concentrators sold far above their usual retail prices.

Australia is ignoring a crucial issue around its hotel quarantine system that may be putting people at unnecessary risk, one expert says.
Australia’s hotel quarantine program is under scrutiny as further COVID-19 leaks have led to more lockdowns amid claims of “negligence” in the country’s approach to airborne transmission.
Professor Michael Toole, an epidemiologist at the Burnet Institute who worked at the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) for 10 years, believes authorities are not taking the risk of airborne spread seriously enough.
He has blamed the Infection Control Expert Group (ICEG), which issues advice on infection prevention and control issues, for not producing stricter guidelines.
Concerns were again raised this week after returned travellers managed to spread COVID-19 to others in hotel quarantine in Western Australia, sparking a three-day lockdown.
It was the second time this year the state has gone into lockdown after a quarantine leak.
NSW also confirmed a leak in a Sydney hotel after two families in adjacent rooms were found to have the virus last week. It follows an earlier leak in March when a security guard and another guest became infected.
The leaks saw WA Premier Mark McGowan request the number of returning travellers entering the state be halved, a move that he may want to make permanent, and Australia has now suspended flights from India.
While some on Twitter have defended Australia’s quarantine as being hugely successful despite the small number of leaks, Prof Toole doesn’t agree.
“14 leaks in 5 cities in 5 months is not just a few,” Prof Toole wrote on Twitter in response to a post from Dr Nick Coatsworth, who is advising the Morrison government on its COVID-19 response.
“It’s negligence and ICEG is responsible.”
In explaining his post, Prof Toole told news.com.au he was concerned ICEG had not recommended the use of N95 masks instead of surgical masks, and a national standard for ventilation in hotels had not been set.
“We are still denying at a federal level that this form of transmission even occurs, we don’t even say that it occurs rarely,” he said.
“This is at the heart of the fragmented approach of protecting guests.”
RELATED: Victoria to build quarantine facility at Mickleham
The approach to hotel ventilation among states can vary widely. Victoria has analysed every hotel room in its system to ensure they have “negative pressure”, which means air flows into hotel rooms when the door is opened, rather than outwards.
South Australia has also assessed its medi-hotel where COVID-positive patients stay, although other hotels haven’t been assessed. Western Australia did a ventilation audit but did not implement changes in time to prevent the latest leak.
It’s unclear whether other states have done ventilation audits.
Prof Toole said a national standard needed to be set between state, territory and federal governments about hotel quarantine.
“Our international borders are no longer airstrips, they are the hotel corridors,” he said.
“All nine governments should be pouring resources into this issue, this is our number one defence and we are spending billions on vaccines but not spending much on making sure our borders are safe.
“Don’t penny pinch, N95 masks are not exactly made of gold. There’s no shortage of them because we hardly have any patients in hospital so we just need to do it.”
However, infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collignon, who is a member of ICEG, disagrees, and said airborne spread was not as significant as some people feared.
“If aerosol is the predominate way the virus is spread then surgical and cloth masks won’t work and it could spread really long distances, like 20 metres,” he said.
“This is not happening, the majority of the spread is happening among close contacts and masks seem to give protection.”
An ICEG statement issued in January about the emergence of more easily spread variants, acknowledged that contaminated air currents could have contributed to transmission of the virus associated with leaks in hotel quarantine.
It said airborne transmission was believed to mainly occur because of specific actions such as singing or heavy breathing during exercising, especially in poorly ventilated, crowded indoor settings.
ICEG recommended the use of face and eye protection but stopped short of specifying N95 masks.
RELATED: How did India’s COVID crisis get so bad?
Prof Collignon acknowledges there could be airborne spread but it is not a significant source of infection.
“Where is the evidence that if you are wearing a surgical mask and eye protection, that there has been any significant transmission to staff?,” he said.
Prof Collignon said no studies had shown N95 masks gave more protection than surgical masks in a real-world situation.
“If surgical masks are used correctly they are very effective,” he said.
“I agree good ventilation is a good idea and not having rooms with ‘positive pressure’ but most of the time when there have been infections, it’s because basic infection control hasn’t been followed.”
He said it was impossible to bring the risk of infection down to zero.
“I think NSW Health has shown you can make the risk very, very low if you follow the appropriate procedures.”
However, Prof Toole said authorities should be aiming for an 100 per cent effective strategy.
“Particularly as it’s a fragile time, an increasing number of travellers are infectious, there are new variants and we have low numbers of people vaccinated,” he said.
“We’ve had a bit of luck so far but what if the next person who is infected has a very high viral load and goes to a bar? You can get a superspreading event almost overnight.
“You can’t presume that every time there are a few cases, that that’s okay – that’s too high a risk in my opinion.”

A new facility to be used in a revamped quarantine system that will change the way COVID-19 cases are handled has been unveiled.
The Victorian government will build a dedicated COVID-19 quarantine facility at Mickleham in Melbourne’s north.
Acting Premier James Merlino made the announcement on Thursday morning just two months after Premier Daniel Andrews revealed the state would embark on the mission following several leaks of the virus from hotel quarantine.
The alternative quarantine model is expected to include cabin-style purpose-built accommodation outside of Melbourne’s CBD, similar to Howard Springs near Darwin.
The 500-bed facility will be built on Donnybrook Road and construction is expected to cost about $200m.
It will also cost $15m to get the project ready to construction.
Mr Merlino said it would take four months to build and could be open by the end of the year if the proposal was given the tick of approval in September.
Mr Merlino said the Victorian government had asked the commonwealth to fund the construction and take ultimate ownership of the site.
He said the preferred site was on commonwealth land next to an existing animal quarantine facility.
The facility is expected to address “the changing threat of new hyper-infectious, fast-moving strains of coronavirus”, Mr Andrews said in February when he revealed the government planned to go at it alone to build the facility.
Criticism of COVID-19 quarantine hotels has ramped up in recent days after the virus escaped the Mercure Hotel in Perth and sent the city into a snap three-day lockdown.
The virus also escaped from the Melbourne Airport Holiday Inn quarantine hotel in February after a returning traveller infected other guests and staff.
Victoria’s deadly second wave – that resulted in an eight-week stage 4 lockdown last year – also jumped from returned travellers to staff at a city hotel before spreading throughout the community.
Mr Merlino said about 10 sites were identified as potential locations for the facility, and one of the tasks of the business case was to narrow that down to a single preferred site.
One of the sites considered, and initially believed to be the frontrunner, was Avalon Airport.
As part of the business case, a team of senior Victorian officials investigated parcels of land close to Melbourne and Avalon airports that could be used to construct the bespoke, stand-alone accommodation hubs.
The sites were evaluated against a set of criteria that included proximity to a public hospital, international airport, transport and other services, as well as land area and site-specific considerations.
A Melbourne Airport spokeswoman confirmed to NCA NewsWire on Tuesday that they decided not to bid for the facility due to a “commercial decision”.
The government also sent a delegation to Howard Springs, which is yet to have any issues with the virus jumping from returned travellers into the community, to examine the quarantine facility as part of the business case.
Mr Merlino said the facility would be built subject to the federal government’s agreement but the state government would push on with the planning work while the commonwealth considers the proposal to not lose time.
The Victorian Government has provided a detailed summary of the business case to the commonwealth.
“This is a commonwealth responsibility and just like Howard Springs it should be owned by the commonwealth,” Mr Merlino said.
“The proposal is it would be operated by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria.
“The best time to start work on a stand-alone quarantine hub would have been 12 months ago – the second-best time is now.”
A final decision on whether to proceed with construction will be made in September, pending support from the commonwealth and future insights on a range of matters, including the progress of the nation’s vaccine rollout, the efficacy of vaccines in preventing transmission, and commonwealth decisions on rules governing travel into and out of Australia.
“The virus is going to continue to be with us for some time,” Mr Merlino said.
“We’ve got a delayed rollout of the commonwealth’s vaccine program, we have a dire situation in other parts of the world.
“We simply do not know what our situation will be in September. This is about giving us options, options to make our community even safer.”
The master plan for the new hub includes dedicated onsite services, including catering, that will support strong infection control and prevention measures.
It is also designed with the ability to be increased up to 3000 beds – at a cost of $700m – if a larger facility is determined to be required at any point.
The Victorian government plans to use the new facility, designed with relocatable cabins, for future emergency accommodation needs, including ongoing quarantine arrangements, crisis accommodation or bushfire emergency accommodation.

Sky News contributor Stephen Conroy says the Australian government has been “caught short” amid India’s COVID-19 situation.

“And it should have been doing more to prepare quarantine facilities that could have been easily upgraded to take a great influx. 

“Now we’ve been caught short. We have apparently between 8,000 and 9,000 Australian citizens who are now in harm's way because we will not do what is the fundamental first obligation of a government.”

Sky News contributor Graham Richardson says the increase of COVID-19 cases in India is "hardly a big deal" and "we're trying to make it a big one" for reasons he doesn't quite understand.

"The numbers have never added up to hysteria and yet that's all we seem to get about it," he said.

With astronomical infection rates and people “dropping like flies”, this particularly confusing image out of India has attracted heavy criticism.
Fresh images of political rallies taking place in India have attracted strong criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has come under fire in recent weeks for his government’s handling of the devastating second wave.
A whopping 360,900 cases recorded on Wednesday — the most by a single country in a 24-hour period since the beginning of the pandemic — has scattered the nation’s healthcare system, which is now dealing with over 3,000 deaths per day with dwindling oxygen supplies and waitlists for ICU beds.
The nature of India’s tightly-packed population has spelled disaster for social distancing as the latest mutated wave wreaks havoc through the country. New statistics out of Kolkata in the region of West Bengal revealed 45 per cent of civilians turning up for tests are returning positive results.

Despite the urgent need to stem the recent “tsunami” of infections, members of Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have continued to publicly campaign for the under-fire leader, holding political rallies to build support ahead of municipal elections.
The BJP tweeted pictures of thousands attending a rally at Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation last week. The close-up shots of rallygoers packed shoulder to shoulder — with some even forgoing masks — unsurprisingly struck a sour note with critics around the country.

Kapil Komireddi, author of the book Malevolent Republic: A Short History of the New India, condemned the ruling party, describing the political push as “murderously reckless” given the current climate.
“Only a few hundred kilometres from this event, a local journalist told me people are dropping like flies,” Komireddi said in a tweet on Tuesday.

Aam Aadmi Party politician Vinay Mishra also shared photos of the BJP election rally in the state of Telangana, writing: “Just in case if you thought your Prime Minister has become sensitive and sympathetic for COVID deaths.”
He noted that the last BJP campaign was in West Bengal, which is seeing an up to 600 per cent surge in COVID cases.
Believe it or not, this is all happening in the country that recorded record cases of over 3,60,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths in 24 hours. #indiacovidsecondwave#secondwave#covidappropriatebehaviour#BJPRally#centralvistaproject#indiacovicrisis#taleoftwoindiaspic.twitter.com/Tysk7Ku5Uy
“I’ve never seen such huge crowds,” Mr Modi said in West Bengal on April 17 — even as India set a world record of 230,000 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours.
The BJP has since deleted its post advertising the rally.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said limited vaccine coverage and a false sense of confidence after stamping out the first wave in 2020 have helped create the “perfect storm” gripping the subcontinent nation this month.
The WHO has pulled out all stops for the 1.4 billion strong population, diverting 2,600 health experts from other programs to help stem the latest wave, which has seen an incredible six million new cases emerge in April alone.

“As is true in any country, WHO has said the combination of relaxing of personal protective measures, mass gatherings and more contagious variants while vaccine coverage is still low can create a perfect storm,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jašarević told CNN on Wednesday.
Mr Jašarević said the healthcare system was overrun partly because of panicked patients needlessly rushing to hospitals after testing positive. The WHO representative said up to 85 per cent of positive cases could be managed safely from home in isolation.
“Currently, part of the problem is that many people rush to the hospital (also because they do not have access to information/advice), even though home-based care monitoring can be managed very safely,“ he said. “Less than 15 per cent of people who have the infection actually need hospital care and even fewer will need oxygen.”
US officials: ‘This hasn’t peaked yet’
US President Joe Biden has pledged support for India, telling Mr Modi in a phone call on Monday: “You let me know what you need, and we will do it.”
Kurt Campbell, the White House’s National Security Council coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, said the dire situation in the subcontinent will take time to settle as world powers organise international aid.
“We all have to realise that this is not a challenge that is going to resolve in the next several days,” he told a virtual press conference this week, via Reuters.
Gayle Smith, head of the US State Department’s COVID-19 response, said India needs to brace itself with the worst likely yet to come. “We all need to understand that we are still at the front end of this. This hasn’t peaked yet,” she said.
“So this is going to require determination … We’re going to work really hard for some time, but we’re confident we can do it.
“We anticipate that at the height of this kind of complex emergency, it’s going to be very fluid for a while as things fall into place. We are collectively going to have to be very agile and very nimble.”
Critics condemn PM Modi’s social media crackdown
Mr Modi’s BJP has copped consistent criticism in 2021 after reports of the Indian government censoring anti-Modi tweets began filtering through the press. The recent push to stamp out online dissidents was made possible by new social media laws forcing companies to hand over the name of the original sender of any message deemed “mischievous”.
The recent outrage over coordinating rallies and censorship has irked public figures like former Twitter India boss Raheel Khursheed, who believes the government has its priorities backwards in the middle of a crisis.
Mr Khursheed said the government shouldn’t be preoccupied with controlling public discourse as history unfolds before their eyes, calling for increased support for hospitals at capacity.
“In a pandemic the Indian government should be concerning itself with diffusing the situation rather than diffusing the news of the situation,” he told BBC Newsnight this week.
“If there are people lining up outside crematoriums waiting for their turns for over 48 to 72 hours, what you should be busy figuring out is how to diffuse that situation.
“What you should be basically figuring out is how to get oxygen to hospitals.”
Huge earthquake caps off India’s month from hell
It really feels like we’re witnessing a particularly cruel episode of Black Mirror at this point.
Just as everyone thought April couldn’t get worse for India, a massive 6.2 magnitude earthquake tore through the Assam region of the country on Wednesday. Shocking footage of the earthquake’s destruction has been shared on social media by witnesses, with a locals describing it as one of the strongest they’ve experienced.
“This earthquake was the biggest I can remember, there was first a big jolt and then a smaller one,” a police official in the town told Reuters.
India’s National Disaster Management Agency is in the process of assessing damage and casualties. There have been no immediate reports of deaths.
“Our entire multi-storeyed apartment has witnessed massive damage with roofs and walls caving in,” Subham Hazarika, a businessman who lives in an up-market apartment in Guwahati, told Reuters.
“Luckily no one got injured.”

The pandemic transformed shopping, creating some positive habits that can help us manage our money – and lives – for years to come.
The coronavirus pandemic transformed shopping, creating positive habits among consumers that should help them better manage their money – and their lives – for years to come.
New spending trends highlight some new-found appreciation and beliefs “that we should try to keep up”, says Jethro Marks, CEO of e-commerce platform The Nile Group.
Marks says during the pandemic demand for parenting advice books more than trebled, and baby products are also surging.
“Old school board games and puzzles have also made a really strong comeback and remain high, as a refreshing way to spend some good quality time with family, minus the screen time,” he says.
How many colds have you had in the past year?
For many Australians the answer is zero or close to zero, after they spent much more money on hand sanitisers and other home hygiene products.
“This new focus on illness prevention – instead of just being resigned to regularly coughing and sneezing – is one we should all continue moving forward,” Marks says.
Queensland Consumers Association spokesman Ian Jarratt says many Australians experienced reduced incomes or job losses, or know friends and family who suffered financially.
“Quite a few people have become more conscious about how much they spend and the benefits of getting value for money,” he says.
There is also a rapid reduction in credit card debt and greater focus on budgeting, which are both “very positive”, Jarratt says.
As online spending surged, the days of buying goods in a shop without checking competitors’ prices almost disappeared.
“I think online has encouraged people to shop around,” Jarratt says.
However, the rapid shift to online shopping has removed some opportunities to haggle in-store for extras such as free delivery, extended warranties or better products, he says.
Marks says DIY kits, books and instruction manuals have surged in popularity in areas including gardening, carpentry, needlework, flower arranging and even witchcraft.
“Cookbooks overall shot up by 616 per cent when we were all stuck at home, and continue to dominate now,” he says.
Making time to continue embracing hobbies and passions will help create more fulfilling and creative lives, Marks says.

A new report has revealed that a new pill is being developed by Pfizer as a potential cure for COVID-19.
A pill that’s being developed by Pfizer as a potential cure for COVID-19 could be ready later this year if the trials are successful, a report said.
The antiviral drug, PF-07321332, is designed to attack the “spine” of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to prevent it from replicating in the nose, throat and lungs, the Telegraph reported.
“We have designed PF-07321332 as a potential oral therapy that could be prescribed at the first sign of infection, without requiring that patients are hospitalised or in critical care,” Mikael Dolsten, who leads the company’s worldwide research, development and medical division, said in a statement.
Trials are already underway with volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60 in the US and Brussels, the newspaper reported.
“If they have moved to this stage, they will be quietly optimistic,” Dr Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, told the Telegraph.
The drug company said the first phase of the trial is designed to look at how the drug is tolerated, in addition “significant side effects, and how people feel after taking it,” according to documents obtained by the newspaper.
The second phase will study how participants react to multiple doses, while the third will look at the impact of eating while on the drug, the outlet reported.
More trials would be needed to determine how the drug works with people infected with COVID-19, the newspaper reported.
If the results of the trials are promising, the oral medication could be available later this year, the outlet reported.
Pfizer, along with its partner BioNTech, has already developed a COVID-19 vaccine that has been shown to be more than 95 per cent effective.

India’s coronavirus death toll has officially surpassed 200,000, but experts and health workers warn the true scale of devastation is much worse.

More than 360,000 new cases were reported in the past 24-hours; the seventh consecutive day where global records were beaten.

Health workers and scientists have warned the official death figures are being under-reported as dears the true extent of India’s COVID-19 catastrophe is much worse.

Official figures have only been taking into account fatalities which occur in hospitals, but many hospitals and medical facilities have been forced to turn away thousands of patients due to over capacity.

India’s debilitating second wave has broken a grim new record after shocking numbers from the troubled nation were released on Wednesday.
India has recorded its worst day on record as it reels from its latest debilitating coronavirus crisis, recording a whopping 360,960 new infections and 3293 deaths in last 24-hour period.
The new figures mark an incredible jump after the nation recorded 220,000 fresh cases on Tuesday.
India has now reported a total of 18 million infections, with the latest daily spike the highest a single country has ever recorded in a 24-hour period.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world was doing everything it can to help the struggling country, which has spent the last week breaking global infection records.
“WHO is doing everything we can, providing critical equipment and supplies, including thousands of oxygen concentrators, prefabricated mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies,” he said.
RELATED: India hit with massive earthquake
This month alone, the country has added almost six million new cases.
The explosion in infections, blamed in part on a new virus variant as well as mass political and religious events, has overwhelmed hospitals and caused a dire shortage of beds, drugs and oxygen.
The crisis is particularly severe in New Delhi, with people dying outside packed hospitals where three people are often forced to share beds. Clinics have been running out of oxygen.India has so far administered 150 million vaccine shots and from Saturday, the program will be expanded to include all adults, meaning 600 million more people will be eligible.
However, many states are warning that they have insufficient vaccine stocks and experts are calling on the government to prioritise vulnerable groups and badly-hit areas.

However, no deaths have been recorded so far.
Australia has begun to see the effects of the ongoing crisis in India as people attempt to leave the country in droves. WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state was preparing for more cases after a flight touched down in Perth on Tuesday carrying 78 passengers who had recently been in India.
Mr McGowan said two of the four new WA cases in hotel quarantine likely brought the virus from the subcontinent.

A diplomat returning from overseas drove from Sydney to Canberra to quarantine at home before testing positive to coronavirus.
A diplomat returning from overseas tested positive for COVID-19 after entering Canberra, officials said on Wednesday.
The man in his 50s flew to Sydney International Airport and travelled to the nation’s capital via private vehicle on the same day, Australian Capital Territory health authorities said in a statement.
“While in quarantine, the diplomat experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms and was tested for COVID-19, returning a positive result,” the statement read.
It said the man did not stop on his way to Canberra and has been quarantined at home since he returned.
“The individual has followed all quarantine measures for returning overseas travellers and is being supported by ACT Health,” the statement said.
Health officials will perform genome sequencing to see what strain of the coronavirus the man was infected with.
Three close contacts have been identified via contact tracing and have also been put in quarantine.
“There is no risk to the public,” the health department said.
The department said that returning diplomats and government officials enter the capital “on a regular basis” and that reports of positive cases in the territory’s quarantine system are not uncommon.
“This is exactly why the ACT has a quarantine system,” the statement said.
“The circumstances of this new case demonstrates that our quarantine system here in the ACT is working well to protect the Canberra community from COVID-19.”
The ACT has had the lowest COVID-19 numbers in the country since the pandemic started last year.
There have only been 123 total cases in Canberra, including overseas infections.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health/premier-hints-at-double-digit-covid19-surge-in-hotel-quarantine/news-story/c67ff71e1ba82be6bf949ab8aea84a08
NSW residents have been told to prepare for another spike in hotel quarantine infections, as the alarming trend continues across multiple states.
The alarming rise in hotel quarantine infections across multiple Australian states is expected to worsen, with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian warning of a “double digit” spike.
NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have all experienced a surge in returned travellers testing positive to COVID-19 in recent days, with many cases linked to people coming back from coronavirus ravaged India.
So far today there have been 24 COVID-19 cases in hotel quarantine across Australia. However, not all states have released their daily figures so that number could grow.
On Wednesday, NSW recorded nine new hotel quarantine infections, with Ms Berejiklian warning tomorrow’s figures are expected to exceed this number.
“I was just advised that overnight we have already had double digit new cases in our hotel quarantine system, which we will report on tomorrow,” she said during Wednesday’s press conference.
“The increasing incidents of disease in some parts of the world is very substantial, it is impacting us in our quarantine system.”
RELATED: ‘Half a billion cases’: Fears of virus cover-up
Authorities are still working to determine the source of origin for the new hotel quarantine cases but chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed there has been a rise in infections coming from India.
“As you would expect we are seeing a higher rate of positivity in returning travellers from India,” she said.
It follows multiple days of high quarantine infections rates, with NSW recording 49 new quarantine cases since Friday.
Queensland, which had previously been recording low levels of daily infections in returned travellers, experienced a sharp rise with nine hotel cases confirmed overnight.
South Australia has also seen an increase in hotel quarantine infections, recording 14 new cases on Monday, up from the nine recorded on Friday.

Likewise, the Northern Territory has been battling a wave of international cases, recording four new infections on Monday, 10 on Saturday and 13 on Friday.
Of those quarantine cases, 24 had arrived on flights from India.
In the past two days, Western Australia has recorded eight new hotel quarantine cases, the majority of which have been linked to returned travellers from India.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan claimed more than half of Australia’s active COVID-19 cases were now from people who had returned from India.
“These days the rate is now over half of our cases are out of India,” Mr McGowan told reporters on Wednesday, labelling the situation “terribly tragic”.
Questions over who is allowed to leave and re-enter Australia
It follows revelations that Perth’s recent three-day lockdown was sparked by a man who was allowed to travel to India for his wedding before returning to Australia.
In response to the growing COVID-19 crisis in India, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has suspended flights to and from the country until May 15.
Epidemiologist Professor at the University of Sydney, Alexandra Martiniuk, told news.com.au that cases of people being allowed to leave the country for seemingly non-essential reasons have sparked a discussion about what should and shouldn’t be allowed.
“Australian citizens have voiced that the decision-making regarding who is allowed to travel overseas and then return, is opaque and this could be made more clear,” she said.
“For instance there is concern about this travel is for weddings, athletes, movie stars, etc. Then these ‘travellers’ return (with) an increasing number carrying COVID.”
RELATED: Stupid reasons people are allowed into Oz
Professor Martiniuk said it appears the public is in agreeance that travel for compassionate reasons should be allowed, such as to assist a family member dying overseas or to attend a funeral, but there is concern about how broad the reasons for leaving the country have become.
With multiple states seeing transmission events in hotel quarantine settings in recent weeks, this spike of infected travellers also serves to heighten fears the virus could leak back into the community.
Is our current hotel quarantine system the best option?
Professor Martiniuk said the government needs to consider if its current hotel quarantine system is the best option for Australians.
“The variants (overseas) are more transmissible, and we need to consider if the hotels are best equipped to deal with airborne spread,” she said.
“We do need to consider if quarantine in hotel facilities in major cities is the best approach. Having this approach justified for the public would be useful.”
Many health professionals have been urging the government to further consider the seriousness that airborne transmission can pose, particularly in hotel quarantine settings.
UNSW’s head of biosecurity research, Professor Raina MacIntyre, told news.com.au that more needs to be done to stop ongoing leakages from hotels, adding there is more at stake now more mutant strains of the virus are emerging.
“The next issue is addressing airborne transmission – sadly, this is denied by the national committee, ICEG, which advises AHPPC,” she said.
“As long as we deny airborne transmission, we cannot stop continual breaches in hotel quarantine. We need to address ventilation, use portable air cleaners, provide hotel quarantine staff with N95 respirators, and select quarantine venues based on the adequacy of ventilation.”
The increase in hotel quarantine cases across Australia reflects the “global situation” with respect to COVID-19, Professor Martiniuk said, pointing out it is a grim reminder of why our international borders have remained closed for so long
“Sadly it has reminded us in Australia that the reopening of borders may not come as soon as hoped,” she said.
“Watching the world grapple with COVID however, has given further support to the approaches being taken by Australia which have protected our residents’ health and our economy.”

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/technology/gaming/outofprint-conspiracy-card-game-from-1994-that-predicted-911-sees-renewed-popularity-amid-covid19/news-story/aa7a7e43202fbd12de70f39af14269b9
An out-of-print card game released more than 25 years ago appears to have eerily foreshadowed COVID-19 and Donald Trump’s election.
An out-of-print conspiracy theory collectable card game released more than 25 years ago appears to have eerily foreshadowed current events including the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest in Washington DC and the rise of political correctness.
Sealed decks of Illuminati: New World Order (INWO) cards currently fetch up to $1300 on sites like Amazon and eBay.
Some sought-after individual cards – such as “Terrorist Nuke”, which depicts a scene uncannily similar to the 9/11 attacks – go for more than $50 apiece.
A long-time favourite of collectors, INWO, released in 1994 by Steve Jackson Games, is a Magic: The Gathering-style spin-off of the company’s Illuminati board game, which itself was based on the 1975 Illuminatis! Trilogy novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
Internet users and conspiracy theorists have drawn attention to the cards over the years for the apparent prescience of the irreverent, apocalyptic artwork – notably after September 11, 2001, due to an image resembling the explosion as the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and another depicting flames coming out of the Pentagon.
Other cards – there are 330 in total – have been highlighted on social media more recently for their apparent relevance to current events.
They include Donald Trump’s presidency – a blond-haired “Charismatic Leader” depicted speaking to a large crowd – the COVID-19 pandemic, violent riots and protests in the US, and images of a militarised White House surrounded by wire fencing.
One card, “Epidemic”, depicts a pile of body-bags, a face mask, gloves, disinfectant and the word “quarantine”.
“Disaster! This is an Attack to Destroy any Place,” the text reads. “If the attack succeeds, the target is Devastated. This attack cannot actually destroy the target.”
Another card, “Center for Disease Control”, reads, “As its action, the CDC can supply Relief to one Devastated location each turn. If the CDC makes a direct attack to destroy a Place, it can use biological warfare to get a +15 (!!) to its attack.”
A card dubbed “Political Correctness” depicts two men hanging by nooses with signs reading “used insensitive pronoun” and “ate flesh of dead animals”. “Good thoughts are now required,” the card says. “Increase the Power of all Liberal groups by 3. All Conservative groups with a Power of 0 or 1 become Criminal as well.”
Several cards relate to unrest in the streets, including “Upheaval!”, which depicts a protester punching riot police, and “Law and Order”, which features a cop swinging a baton at a cowering person.
Other cards include “Market Manipulation”, “Sweeping Reforms”, “Rewriting History”, “Gun Control”, “March on Washington”, “Combined Disasters”, “Media Blitz”, “Urban Gangs” and “World War Three”.
One supernatural-themed card appropriately features a “Plague of Demons” swarming around the US Congress building, while the “Watermelons” card reads, “One-time Communists, looking for a new cause, drift into Green movements. All Green groups are considered Communist and vice versa.”
Game designer Steve Jackson, writing in Dragon Magazine, has previously described the origins of the Illuminati games and that he wanted the tone to be “tongue-in-cheek rather than serious”.
“It’s possible to get deadly serious about the idea of conspiracies and assassinations,” he said. “I didn’t want that. Among all the material I’d read, the articles with the really wacky theories – even if they were presented totally seriously – were the most fun to read. Logically, then, a wacky game should be more fun to play.”
He added that “as much as possible, I wanted to retain the ‘flavour’ of the conspiracy material I’d been reading”.
“That’s why groups like the South American Nazis, the Cattle Mutilators, the Fluoridators, the Communists, the Oil Companies, and the United Nations, are in there,” he said.
“You can’t have a good conspiracy theory without stringing together all these elements and a dozen more – so here they are.”
John Grigni, one of the illustrators who worked on the cards, spoke to Vice News in 2012 about some of the seemingly prophetic imagery.
“The Twin Towers card is actually titled ‘Terrorist Nuke’, which I recall from that time was a concern relating to the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he said.
“Terrorism was heating up as a ‘headline seller’ without the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation, but we were still looking at Hamas and Palestine as likely culprits for such acts. Art direction-wise, frankly a nuke wouldn’t just blow up one building, even a ‘tactical’ nuke would do damage on a much larger scale. It does seem oddly prescient, given the ‘twin towers’ shown.”

There are situations where people can go overseas to attend a wedding and come home despite tens of thousands unable to return to Australia.
The government has been accused of leaving stranded Aussies “in the lurch (and) confused” after revelations people can still travel overseas for weddings and take a quarantine place on return.
The government has barred Australian travel to India for weddings and funerals, as the country grapples with the world’s worst COVID-19 outbreak.
But Immigration Minister Alex Hawke confirmed on Wednesday that measure would not be extended to other countries.
Labor home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally said the government had left the 34,500 Australians wanting to return home “in the lurch, confused and left behind”.
“Seriously, this tired old Liberal government doesn’t know if it’s coming or going. What a mess,” she said.

“Let’s remember, if Scott Morrison kept his promises – like bringing all of the stranded Aussies home by Christmas last year or rolling out a vaccine this year – we wouldn’t be in this mess right now.”
Earlier, Mr Hawke told Sky News that Australians could still be granted exemptions for “urgent reasons”, which could include attending a wedding.
“So next week someone could still go overseas, go to a wedding and come back through quarantine?” asked host Tom Connell.
“Yes. There can be situations, but maybe not to India at this moment,” Mr Hawke replied.
Exemptions allowing overseas travel for weddings are contentious, particularly after it was revealed the source of a COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia had been allowed to travel to India for a ceremony.
The Australian Border Force’s operational directive for outbound exemptions does not mention weddings but exemptions were “generally” approved for a family member’s funeral overseas.
WA Premier Mark McGowan last week said it was “just nuts” to allow guests to potentially bring the virus home.
Every returning traveller also takes up a limited space in hotel quarantine, adding to the 34,500 Australians registered with DFAT wanting to return home.
“Why (can) that person go off to a wedding when someone else is wanting to get home, because they need to get home, because they can’t earn money anymore?” Connell asked.
Mr Hawke rejected suggestions it was a “zero sum game” despite a cap on hotel quarantine places.
“It’s never about exactly one place versus another. It’s flight availability. Affordability has changed several times during the pandemic,” he said.
Mr Hawke said the government had ramped up charter flights, but many Australians overseas had “changed their minds” about returning home.
A DFAT spokesperson confirmed 512,000 Australians have returned home since the government recommended people reconsider their need to travel abroad.
The government on Tuesday suspended all flights from India until mid-May at the earliest after the country recorded over 350,000 COVID-19 cases on Sunday.
The moved left roughly 9000 Australians stranded in India, including between 600 and 650 listed as vulnerable.
A group of Australian cricketers, including superstar Steve Smith, are also stuck having travelled to compete in the lucrative Indian Premier League.
But Mr Hawke said the government would not expedite their return.
“That’s a difficult situation, everyone’s in difficult situation,” he said.
“(But) the government’s put a priority on vulnerable Australians … I think Australians would expect us to have that priority.”

There are concerns coronavirus could be spread through one of the most routine things humans do, with calls for more research.
There are concerns toilets could spread COVID-19 because flushing could generate aerosols that linger in the air.
A report published in the Medical Journal of Australia highlighted several examples of how coronavirus was spreading via airborne transmission including by “faecal aerosols produced by toilet flushing”.
The article refers to an outbreak in an apartment building in China where the virus appeared to spread between a person on the 15th floor to “vertically aligned flats” on the 25th and 27th floors “by means of dried-out floor or bath drains”.
“An environmental sample in an unoccupied flat on the 16th floor was also positive. Faecal aerosols produced by toilet flushing were thought to be responsible,” the report said.
Speaking to NCA NewsWire Deakin University Chair of Epidemiology, professor Catherine Bennett, said there was no evidence COVID-19 had spread via toilets in hotel quarantine but anything that increased the risk of aerosolization should be examined.
“There’s going to be contaminated discharge (after flushing) but that depends on how the toilets work – that’s an engineering question,” she said.
“Anyway that you can actually increase your risk of aerosolization (increases risk of transmission).
“Do we need to worry about the bathroom systems in hotels? It’s something they should look at.”
She highlighted how the majority of instances where the virus had spread between returned travellers in hotel quarantine had occurred between adjacent rooms.
Professor Bennett said rooms above and below had bathrooms which could feed into the same sewage pipe, meaning there would be more examples of transmission between rooms on various floors, which wasn’t the case.
“We’re not seeing vertical transmission, we’re only seeing transmission occur on the same floor,” she said.
“While we have to be aware of every possible flaw, particularly in hotel quarantine, we’re not seeing anything to suggest the plumbing side of it is an issue, but we’ve definitely seen enough to prove local aerosolized spread is the most important thing to focus on from here.”
The report called for more research into how toilets could spread infectious diseases.
“Additional research in multiple areas is warranted to assess the risks posed by toilet plume, especially within health care facilities,” the report stated.
University of South Australia epidemiologist Professor Adrian Esterman said transmission via aerosols was one of the reasons he always closed the lid before flushing.
“Another way of generating aerosols is the use of hand blow dryers,” he said.
Though studies have found traces of COVID-19 in the gastrointestinal tract, and sewage surveillance programs have detected traces in wastewater, there’s no evidence of infection taking place through faeces, the World Health Organisation said last year.
The Department of Health said there wasn’t a big risk of COVID-19 spreading through toilet use in Australia because the country’s plumbing is different than in some other countries.
A spokesperson said that there were early fears that COVID-19 would spread in the same way as SARS did in 2003, when high-rise apartment toilets were found to generate aerosols that contributed to transmission.
“To date there has not been convincing evidence that COVID-19 mimics SARS completely, and for SARS this potential transmission pathway was not seen extensively in other regions indicating other factors including building codes are important to consider,” the spokesperson said.
“It is generally important that anyone who has been to the bathroom maintains good hand hygiene and washes their hands. People should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
“The department monitors emerging evidence on transmission pathways, and notes that differences in plumbing and building codes exist between countries which may reduce the relevance of this issue in the Australian context.”

Marine iguanas bask in the sun at the Galapagos National Park on Santa Cruz Island, in the Galapagos Islands west of Ecuador
When the coronavirus pandemic reached South America human activity on the Galapagos Islands, in the Pacific west of Ecuador, ground almost to a halt, leaving giant tortoises, iguanas and other endemic species to themselves.
A four-month lockdown starting in February 2020 after Covid-19 was first detected in the region resulted in a total halt of tourism and near complete shutdown of scientific research.
"We had no time to prepare ourselves."
Moncayo's business hasn't recovered. Sometimes his boat sets out to sea with just two customers -- each paying a minimum $160 -- when he needs five to make a profit.
"Out of 12, there are just six left in business," said Moncayo.
Many businesses have kept their shutters down. Hotels and restaurants are deserted.
Some 85 percent of the local economy is dependent on tourism.
One lesson she's learnt is the need for tourism that is "based more on durability ... as a natural heritage site for humanity, that's a responsibility we have to the whole world."
Scientists, too, found themselves twiddling their thumbs, particularly during the lockdown.
Only 30,000 people live on these volcanic islands located around 1,000-kilometers west of Ecuador.
"For a biologist, the Galapagos Islands are Disneyland," added Salinas.
British naturalist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution following a long trip that took in the archipelago of 21 volcanoes, including 13 active ones, the tallest of which is the Wolf at 1,707-meters.
There was "a direct impact on the scientific program: 60 percent of research activities planned for 2020 were suspended," said Danny Rueda, the director of the Galapagos National Park (PNG), responsible for 97 percent of the Galapagos land area and a vast marine reserve of almost 800,000 hectares.
But "movement from one island to another was not allowed."
- 'Time to breathe' -
The government plans to vaccinate all adults on the islands by the end of May, making it "the first archipelago in Latin America" free of Covid-19.
"It's given us a chance to breathe, to organize and analyze the data we've compiled," said Paola Lahuatte, 30, another biologist from the Charles Darwin Foundation, who is studying an invasive species of fly threatening 18 bird species.

Ricky Ponting says the Aussies in India are well aware of the COVID crisis and hopes the IPL can provide some positivity at a bleak time.
Australian cricket great Ricky Ponting concedes it’s a “really strange” feeling being in India amid a COVID-19 crisis but hopes continuing the Indian Premier League proves a positive distraction for the struggling locals.
Ponting is coach of the Delhi Capitals, with fellow Aussies Steve Smith and Marcus Stoinis in his squad. All are likely to be stuck in India until the end of the tournament after a travel ban was put in place by the federal government.
The travel ban is in place until May 15. The group stage of the IPL is due to finish on May 23 with the final on May 30, and the Australians involved in the tournament could be forced to stick it out.
After his team lost a one-run thriller to Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday night, Ponting said his heart went out to all Indians and said the ban on travel for Aussies was only a “small part” of concerns.
“It’s a really strange feeling among our team right now,” Ponting said.
“We’re very aware of what’s happening outside and through greater India at the moment, and our hearts go out to every person in India that is struggling.
“We’ve had one of our players leave. Ravi Ashwin left to be with his family, so it has probably been affecting us, and we are talking about it more than most teams are.
“There have been some other revelations … with things our government have made as far as Australians returning.
“There’s no doubt there have been a few distractions along the way but the travel side of it for us Australians that are here is only a very small part of what we are talking about and what we are thinking about.
“We understand how blessed we are to be able to turn up and do what we did. Hopefully, there are a number of people around India that got some enjoyment out of watching a great game of IPL cricket.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison made it clear, when announcing the travel ban, that cricketers would not get special treatment.
“This wasn‘t part of an Australian tour,” he said.
“They’re under their own resources. And they’ll be using those resources to, I’m sure, to see them return to Australia in accordance with their own arrangements.”
Andrew Tye became the first Australian to leave the IPL last weekend, and both Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa are also trying to get home.
The pair gave up their six-figure contracts with the Royal Challengers Bangalore, but their plans to return home were derailed by Tuesday’s announcement.
While mystery surrounded the pair’s location earlier on Tuesday, it has been revealed both players are in Mumbai – away from their teammates – and are facing an uncertain future.
On Tuesday Tye said the bubble players were “safe”, but he wanted to get home.
“The bubble is very safe and very contained, so we didn’t really have too much idea what was going on other than what we were seeing on the TV or on social media really,” Tye told Network Ten’s The Project.
“I think it was the fact that things were happening in Australia, with hotel quarantine cases being so rough with cases from India. And then governments, state governments, sort of saying they want to back out of having flights from India land or cut down the number of people coming in from India.
“Obviously, some are trying to get out and others are quite happy and content to stay there and see the IPL out.
“I respect each and every one’s individual decisions and that’s their prerogative, and I did what was best for me.”
Australia’s highest-profile cricketers have been stuck in limbo since the Indian travel ban but could be among the first citizens to return home.

Disturbing accusations claim India is lying about its COVID-19 cases, with new surveys and crematorium figures pointing to a much bigger crisis.
Health professionals have accused India of hiding the true number of COVID-19 deaths across the country, as it deals with a “tsunami” of new infections.
On Sunday, India recorded the highest daily increase in COVID-19 cases in the world with 352,991 new infections. And its second wave is showing no signs of stopping with 323,023 cases and 2771 deaths officially recorded on Tuesday.
However, there are fears these disturbing figures could be even higher than what is being officially reported.
Scientists have been using serology surveys to get a more accurate measure of infection rates, with a previous national survey showing the number of cases in India is likely “20 to 30 times higher than what had been reported”, according to CNN.

RELATED: Australia stops all flights from hotspot
Applying this to India’s latest figures raises the estimated total infections for the country to 529 million cases, more than half a billion infections.
Director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi, Ramanan Laxminarayan, told the publication it was “widely known” the case numbers and death toll were being under-reported.
“Last year we estimated that only one in about 30 infections were being caught by testing, so the reported cases are a serious underestimate of true infections,” he said.
“This time, the mortality figures are probably serious underestimates, and what we’re seeing on the ground is many more deaths than what has been officially reported.”
Crematoriums overflowing with COVID victims
University of Michigan epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee labelled the COVID-19 figures coming out of India as a “complete massacre of data”.
She told The New York Times the modelling she and her colleagues have gathered suggest the number of deaths are at least double what officials are currently saying.
“From all the modelling we’ve done, we believe the true number of deaths is two to five times what is being reported,” Professor Mukherjee said.
Crematoriums across the country are overflowing, with some forced to build makeshift facilities in car parks.

There have been multiple reports of discrepancies in the numbers being reported by crematoriums and the number of cremations actually taking place.
On April 17, the state of Gujarat claimed 78 COVID-19 deaths but newspapers reported 689 cremations linked to the virus took place across seven of the state’s cities that same day.
Similar complaints have also surfaced in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Suresh Bhai, a worker at one of the large cremation grounds in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, told The New York Times he had been instructed by his bosses to write “sickness” instead of COVID-19 on the documentation handed over to families of victims.
Doctors beg for help as hospitals overwhelmed
Hospitals are also being crushed under the new wave of infections, with limited supplies leaving doctors begging for help.
Over the past week, multiple Indian states have reported running out of medical oxygen, with patients dying as a result.
New Delhi medic, Dr Gautam Singh, posted a desperate video to social media on Sunday begging for critical medical supplies to keep his patients alive.
“Please send oxygen to us,” he said through a choked voice.
“My patients are dying.”
Trains carrying nearly 150 tonnes of liquid oxygen have been sent out to the worst-affected areas of the country.
Multiple countries have pledged aid to India, with the US and Britain rushing ventilators and vaccine materials to the country.
Crates of ventilators and other oxygen devices from Britain were unloaded at a Delhi airport Tuesday, the first emergency medical supplies to arrive in the country.

The wealthy are paying tens of thousands of dollars to fly out of India in a mass exodus as the virus crisis worsens and countries ban flights.
Wealthy people in India have been escaping the country on private jets and commercial airfares are skyrocketing as the country’s COVID-19 crisis worsens and international borders snap shut.
Indian tycoons and rich families have reportedly fled India for boltholes across Europe, the Middle East and Indian Ocean destinations such as the Maldives, which will ban flights from India on Tuesday, sparking a last-minute rush.
Australia will suspend passenger flights from India until May 15, the federal government announced on Tuesday, and Canada, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the UK have already done the same.

Ranbir Kapoor - Bollywood’s sixth highest paid actor - has been slammed after brazenly sharing pictures on Instagram with his girlfriend Alia Bhatt as they arrived at Mumbai airport on April 19, with the caption “Maldives calling”, The Sun reports.
Both had reportedly only just recovered from coronavirus themselves before hopping on a plane.
They joined fellow Bollywood stars Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff, who jetted off to the Maldives the day before as India continued to battle with devastating infection rates.
While Ranbir, Alia, 28, and Tiger kept a low profile on social media during their trip, Disha, 28, splashed bikini-clad pictures and selfies on her Instagram.

Wealthy Indians are paying as much as 1.5 million rupees, or more than $A25,800, for a one way flight out of India, which includes ground handling and other fees, said Rajan Mehra, the chief executive officer of the New Delhi-based private jet firm Club One Air.
“It’s not only the ultra rich,” he told Bloomberg.
“Whoever can afford to take a private jet are taking private jets.”
Mr Mehra said in some cases, travellers would have to pay extra if the plane needed to be sent back to India empty.
UAE authorities imposed a 10-day ban on flights from India on Sunday. Previously, the Delhi-Dubai route was one of the busiest in the world.
A spokesman for Air Charter Service India told AFP the demand for private jets was “absolutely crazy” before the ban came into effect.
Another provider, Enthral Aviation, got close to 80 inquiries for flights to Dubai in a single day.
“We have requested more aircraft from abroad to meet the demand,” a spokesman for Enthral Aviation told AFP.
“It costs $US38,000 ($A49,000) to hire a 13-seater jet from Mumbai to Dubai, and $US31,000 ($A40,000) to hire a six-seater aircraft.
“People are making groups and arranging to share our jets just to get a seat … We’ve had some queries for Thailand but mostly the demand is for Dubai.”
Commercial airline prices are soaring as seats on flights out of India become harder to come by. In the final days before the UAE’s flight ban came into effect, a one-way flight in economy class from Mumbai to Dubai cost as much as $1600 — more than ten times the regular price.
But as the country continues to set new records for infections and the hospital system threatens to crumble, it’s a price many of the wealthy have been willing to pay.
“That shows how desperately people are trying to get away,” Mr Mehra said.
On Tuesday India recorded a massive rise in virus cases, with 323,144 new infections and 2771 deaths, bringing the caseload to more than 17.6 million.

Speaking about the latest change to US coronavirus guidelines, Joe Biden was asked a curly question. His answer didn’t take long.
The US government has officially relaxed its guidance on mask-wearing, telling Americans they no longer need to use face coverings in most situations outdoors as long as they have been fully vaccinated.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now says it is safe for people vaccinated against COVID-19 to go maskless unless they are attending a crowded outdoor event, like a concert or a game of sport.
“If you are fully vaccinated and want to attend a small, outdoor gathering with people who are vaccinated or unvaccinated, or dine at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households, you can do so safely unmasked,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said today, describing it as a “step back to the normalcy of before”.
“If you are fully vaccinated, things are much safer for you than those who are not yet fully vaccinated.”
According to the latest figures, 96 million Americans have been fully vaccinated so far, more than half of the nation’s adults have received at least one shot, and an average of three million doses are being administered each day.
Nationwide, anyone aged 16 or over is currently eligible to receive the vaccines.

If you are fully vaccinated against #COVID19, you can start doing many things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. If you havenât been vaccinated yet, get a vaccine as soon as you can. See full details: https://t.co/s5kXwg65fBpic.twitter.com/fvhehUiiCi
Speaking to reporters from the sunny North Lawn of the White House this afternoon, President Joe Biden framed the updated guidance as another reason for Americans to get fully vaccinated as quickly as possible.
“Earlier today, the CDC made an important announcement,” Mr Biden said.
“If you’re fully vaccinated and outdoors, and not in a big crowd, you no longer need to wear a mask. If you’re in a crowd, like a stadium or concert, you still need to wear a mask, even if you’re outside.
“Beginning today, gathering with a group in the park, going for a picnic, as long as you are vaccinated and outdoors, you do not need to wear a mask.
“The odds of giving the virus to others is very, very low if you’ve been fully vaccinated and are outdoors.
“If you’re vaccinated, you can do more things, more safely, both outdoors and indoors.
“If you haven’t got it yet, or think you don’t need it, this is another reason to go and get vaccinated, now. Yes, the vaccines are about saving our life and the lives of people around you, but they’re also about getting us back to a more normal way of living.
“So go get the shot. It’s never been easier. And once you’re fully vaccinated, you can go without a mask when you’re outside and away from big crowds.
“Don’t let up now. Keep following the guidance. Go get your vaccination now.”
Vaccine hesitancy remains an issue for the US, with public polling consistently showing at least a fifth of adults do not intend to get the shots.
Mr Biden himself has been fully vaccinated. A reporter asked why he had worn a mask while walking outside to the lectern, implying inconsistency in his messaging about the new guidelines.
“Sir, you chose to wear a mask as you walked out here. What message were you sending by wearing a mask outside, alone?” said NBC correspondent Peter Alexander.
Mr Biden replied with a single sentence, and a grin.
“By watching me take it off, and not put it back on until I get back inside,” he said.
He did remain maskless as he walked back into the building.

While optimistic, the President did also urge Americans to remain cautious.
“We still have a long way to go in this fight,” he said.
“(But) we’ve made stunning progress because of all of you, the American people. Cases and deaths are down dramatically from where they were when I took office, and are continuing to fall.
“When I took office in January, we were losing literally tens of thousands of our seniors each week. At that time, less than 1 per cent of seniors were fully vaccinated. Today, in less than 100 days, more than 67 per cent of our seniors are fully vaccinated, and more than 80 per cent have had one shot.
“Instead of losing thousands of seniors each day, we’re saving thousands of lives, and more and more as each day goes by.”

Millionaires are fleeing on private jets with the rest of India’s population in a COVID crisis. So, what can we Aussies do to help?
India’s second wave has officially reached breaking point with the country’s healthcare system overrun by a whopping 350,000 new cases per day.
Images of bodies piling up -— up to 2,800 daily — have flooded the world press in recent weeks. Indian tycoons and rich families are now reportedly fleeing the nation for boltholes across Europe, the Middle East and Indian Ocean destinations. Unfortunately for the rest of the nation’s 1.4 billion population who don’t own private jets, the situation remains dire.
The pseudo-apocalyptic scene begs the question: What can we Aussies do to help?
Australia’s federal government met this week to discuss sending excess ventilators to the struggling nation, but there are things the average citizen can do, too.
Aussie cricketer Pat Cummins turned heads on Tuesday after donating $50,000 to Indian hospitals. Vowing to see out the Indian Premier league as other Aussies flee home, Cummins said he was “touched by India’s passion and generosity”, contributing some of his Knight Riders pay packet to purchasing oxygen supplies for the country’s hardest hit areas.
While most Aussies don’t have a spare 50 grand to throw around, there are still ways we can help our mates in the subcontinent going through the worst coronavirus wave on record.

As pandemic travel restrictions drag on, people who live far away from ageing parents are struggling with feelings of guilt and helplessness.
The world has shrunk in recent years as international travel became cheaper and faster — but COVID-19 has raised the barriers all over again.
As pandemic travel restrictions drag on, people who live long distances from ageing parents are feeling increasingly helpless and worried about them.
Katie Raleigh, who is originally from Ireland and has been living in Sydney for a decade, was due to visit her relatives in March 2020 but her flights were cancelled.
“I haven’t seen my family for three years now,” she told news.com.au. “Living on the other side of the world was never something I thought about until I literally couldn’t get back to Ireland. As lockdown over there has gone on, I’ve felt guilty that supporting my parents is falling to my siblings, and there’s not much I can do.”
The 37-year-old’s parents both have ongoing health issues, and she’s been speaking to them more than ever. “It was important to me that my family knows I can be called on for help,” she said.
RELATED: How to protect the elderly from COVID-19
Not only are older people more at risk of severe effects of COVID-19, they also face added challenges in terms of isolation and mental health.
The World Health Organisation has warned that older people across the world continue to be “challenged” by requirements to stay at home, lack of physical contact with friends and family, a cessation of their usual activities, and anxiety over illness and death.
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for “improved social support and smarter efforts to reach older people”.
Jessica Silver is the co-founder of ElWell, a UK-based online hub for caregivers that has begun offering specific support to expats across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s always a tricky dynamic when the tables turn and children need to start ‘parenting their parents’ — and distance can make it harder,” she tells news.com.au. “It’s so personal when it’s your family and hard to see the wood for the trees, especially when you live abroad.”
Ms Silver, who lived in Sydney before moving home to the UK, says she “understands the difficulty that comes with seeing your parents get older from afar”, and has found that these feelings have intensified for expats during the pandemic.
RELATED: Australia’s vaccine rollout leaves us vulnerable
Some are only children who need to take control from the other side of the world, while others want to support siblings and other family members in a useful way, helping to make crucial decisions.
Ms Silver and ElWell co-founder Nancy Farmer, a physiotherapist, have created a checklist to help the “sandwich generation” care for elderly parents — even if they live thousands of kilometres away.
Here are their top tips on how expats can support ageing parents:
1. Look for signs: Use your time on the phone or video calls to pick up on any cues that your parents are starting to struggle. Are they acting forgetful? Or does it look like their home is messier than normal? If there’s anything that’s cause for concern, start a Notes section on your phone and monitor it.
2. Speak with your siblings: If you’re lucky enough to have family support on the ground, then speak with them about what you’re thinking. See if they agree (or have other things to add) and remind them that although you live overseas, you want to be as involved as you can be.
3. The talk: It may be time for you and your siblings to talk with your parents about how they really are. Arrange a time that works for all time zones, and tell mum and dad why you want the chat. The overriding sentiment to communicate is that you’re here for them and looking for solutions. Use conversation starters and try to let them lead the chat. What you want is to all raise the noted areas of concern, see if they agree (or if they have other pressing worries) and then collectively agree on next steps.
4. Divide and conquer: While siblings may be able to help your parents on the ground, you can still research and send useful products, look into local resources and find external help. Ask what would make life easier for them — can you sort food delivery or agree a time to consistently ring your parents so some of the pressure is taken off your siblings? You could even do things for a brother or sister if they have to suddenly spend more time helping mum and dad.
5. Plan ahead: Conversations about the future are confronting, but important to have. If the worst happens, think about what you would need to sort out. From their utility providers to all their digital passwords, knowing this information will make your life easier down the track. Start a spreadsheet in Google Drive — you can easily share it with the family.
6. Help them get power of attorney: This legal document is one of the most important things anyone can set up that may never be used but is there if someone can’t make their own decisions (e.g. with dementia). If your parent becomes unwell, you can’t just access their bank accounts to pay for their care, or make health-related decisions for them. Only their attorney can. Even if you live abroad, you can still be named your parent’s POA (although it may help to share this with a sibling).

Australia’s response to the pandemic has allowed the vast majority of loan holders to return to normal repayments, the nation’s peak banking body says.
The majority of loans placed in deep freeze as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have resumed normal repayments, Australia’s peak banking body says.
As at March 31, only 0.5 per cent of the almost 1 million loans that had been deferred due to COVID-19 hardship remained that way, the Australian Banking Association has revealed.
According to the ABA, just 3170 home loans and 508 small business loans are still on hold after industry-wide measures were brought in to assist households and firms at the peak of the economic downturn.
ABA chief executive Anna Bligh said the numbers were a positive reminder of how well Australia had shielded itself from the worst of the financial onslaught caused by the global pandemic.
“These figures reflect the impressive recovery Australia’s economy is experiencing after facing a one-in-100-year pandemic,” Ms Bligh said.
“The fact that unemployment is lower than expected and the economy has rebounded faster than we anticipated is great news for the vast majority of homeowners and small businesses.”
At the height of the pandemic, Australia’s banking industry installed deferral periods of up to six months for mortgage and small business loan customers who had experienced financial hardship as a result of the nation’s first recession in 30 years.
The deferral period has ended, but banks are offering further support to customers and businesses still battling from the effects of the virus.
“Banks will continue to support those households and businesses still doing it tough this year, taking a fair and compassionate approach to get people through the pandemic,” Ms Bligh said.
Loan deferrals peaked last year in June with 854,606 loans paused across the four major banks and Suncorp.
According to the ABA, Victoria has the highest proportion of small business and mortgages still on deferral.

Additional pyres were being built in a park near a Delhi crematorium on April 26, The Hindu reported, as COVID deaths in India mounted. Families have had to wait up to six hours to cremate loved ones at Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan Crematorium, according to The Hindu. A staff member at the crematorium told The Hindu that it was “operating from 6 am to midnight” to accommodate “the surge in COVID-related deaths.” India had recorded 17,636,307 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 197,894 deaths as of April 26, according to government officials. This footage was filmed by local journalist Sohil Sehran.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/breaking-news/victorian-government-bungled-approvals-process-for-10000-covid19-business-grants-report-finds/news-story/510c6e20eca5ea70835fa71fad13ef79
A damning investigation has slammed the Victorian government’s handling of an important coronavirus recovery initiative - initially only staffed with 5 people.
Thousands of Victorian businesses struggling to pay bills have missed out on millions of dollars in COVID-19 entitlements after the Victorian government bungled the approvals process, an investigation has found.
About 12,000 businesses were denied up to $120 million because their applications remained in draft awaiting further information when the deadline expired, with others unfairly denied a grant on other grounds such as application typos or information being provided through an incorrect link.
The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions’ call centre, initially staffed with only five people, could not handle the volume of requests, and was later not given access to the Department’s case management fund.
The shocking findings were published following a Victorian Ombudsman investigation into the Business Support fund, which received more than 1000 complaints.
The government set up the fund in nine days, aimed at providing critical financial support to struggling businesses during the state’s first and second lockdowns.
Premier Daniel Andrews announced the “massive new support package” in September.
“For our state to recover, we need our businesses to recover too. As we take our first safe and steady steps towards COVID Normal, this support will help make sure we get through this together,” Mr Andrews said at the time.
“We’ll continue meeting with and listening to businesses, so we can do everything we can to support them and their workers.”
But Ombudsman Deborah Glass said the execution of the fund left much to be desired.
“The COVID-19 lockdowns fell like a hammer blow on small businesses,” Ms Glass said.
“There was desperation in people’s voices, they were counting on a grant to pay bills, rent, wages - to survive.
“Despite the stress and anxiety caused by COVID-19, in an environment where their businesses were being destroyed, people were being penalised for their honest mistakes.”
Ms Glass has made several key recommendations including inviting almost 12,000 businesses whose applications were rejected to reapply for the fund.
She said the Department unreasonably refused some applications, refusing to reassess them even after the Ombudsman highlighted the harshness of its decisions.
“The aim of the fund was laudable, to support a hugely vulnerable cohort affected by lockdown. But administering it inflexibly undermined its very purpose,” Ms Glass said.
“The people were forgotten in the process.”
The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions said it would reopen the fund for eligible businesses that were denied the $10,000 grant.
Deputy Premier James Merlino said the department accepted all of the recommendations and would contact businesses over this week.
“To those businesses, I know this has been an inconvenience… rest assured, your applications are being reassessed right now,” he told reporters.
“There was some issues, but importantly the department has accepted the recommendations and those businesses will be contacted.
“This was a critical part of our response to the pandemic.”

In Victoria 12,000 businesses missed out on vital COVID-19 support packages during last year’s second wave due to technical issues in the state government’s business support fund.

The $10,000 business grants were meant to provide relief to small businesses impacted by the extended lockdown but some business owners were refused payment over typing errors and IT issues.

The Victorian ombudsman says people were let down when they were most vulnerable.

The chief public health officer has revealed there are currently just 12 available rooms for COVID-positive patients
South Australia’s top public health official has revealed the state currently has just 12 COVID-19 rooms available for positive patients.
Speaking on ABC Radio on Tuesday morning, Nicola Spurrier’s comments came as the state recorded 14 new coronavirus infections on Monday; all returned travellers from overseas in medi hotels.
Professor Spurrier said that large number was not “unexpected” because there was a flight from Malaysia scheduled to land in SA on Saturday.
She said hotel workers at Tom’s Court, including nursing staff, worked on Friday to “reshuffle” guests to make additional room.
Professor Spurrier added there were “a few flights” scheduled to land in SA in recent days but they would be diverted to other states.
“I’m pleased to say we’ve been able to accommodate these additional cases,” she said.
“Obviously, if you keep on getting 14 cases a day you’re not going to be able to manage that, but we’ve been given a reprieve with flights.
“It gives us a chance for some people in Tom’s Court to be discharged and takes a little bit of pressure off us for that period of time.”
When asked the total number of active cases that could be safely managed with current resources, Professor Spurrier explained it was dependent on how sick people were and the family grouping.
She said there were 12 available rooms left in the state’s dedicated COVID-positive facility, what she described as “a reasonable amount of capacity”.
“We try and have the guests at either end of the hotel,” she said.
“That reduces the viral load that can concentrate the passageway but if we had to increase our capacity then we have to shift our guests around which is what we did on Friday.
“We don’t have people squished and about to burst at the seams.
“The nurses are comfortable with how things are going at the moment and we’re expecting some discharges over coming days as well.”
There are currently 32 active cases in the state, with two infected people residing in the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

Alaska Airlines banned US Senator Lora Reinbold from its flights after she repeatedly refused to follow mask requirements at Juneau International Airport on Thursday, April 22, according to local media reports. Anchorage Daily News reported a Juneau Police Department officer arrived at the scene and no enforcement action was taken, citing a department spokesperson. Over the weekend, Reinbold drove more than 700 miles from her home in Eagle River to board a five-hour ferry ride to Juneau and arrived at the state Capitol on Monday in time for legislative duty, local media reported. “I am keenly aware of the monopoly in air transport to Juneau that needs [to be] reviewed!” Reinbold wrote in a Facebook caption on April 25.

Pictures of a mass cremation site in India have emerged, with doctors begging for help as the country is crushed by a new COVID-19 wave.
India has been forced to create a makeshift mass cremation site as the country’s latest wave of COVID-19 infections sees hospitals and crematoriums overflow.
On Monday, India recorded another day of record coronavirus figures, with 352,991 new infections and 2812 deaths.
The spike in deaths has seen crematoriums across the country unable to keep up with the continual stream of COVID-19 victims.
In order to keep up with demand, Ghazipur crematorium in New Delhi was forced to set up a makeshift crematorium site in the car park.

“There are so many bodies that we have added space for 20 more pyres at the Ghazipur crematorium. There is usually a waiting time of three to four hours,” a senior official from the East civic body told The Indian Express.
“On Friday, the GTB mortuary alone had 47 bodies due to this. But we have now managed to cremate them, and more on Saturday. A body takes five to six hours to burn.”
Doctors beg for help as hospitals struggle under infections
Hospitals are also being crushed under the new wave of infections, with limited supplies leaving doctors begging for help.
Over the past week, multiple Indian states have reported running out of medical oxygen, with patients dying as a result.
New Delhi medic, Dr Gautam Singh, posted a desperate video to social media on Sunday begging for critical medical supplies to keep his patients alive.
“Please send oxygen to us,” he said through a choked voice.
“My patients are dying.”
RELATED: How infected man’s India wedding was allowed
Trains carrying nearly 150 tonnes of liquid oxygen have been sent out to the worst-affected areas of the country.
Numbers may be much higher than those being reported
Many experts are predicting the current wave will not peak for at least three weeks and that the real death toll and case count are much higher than what is being reported.
There are fears infections could soon hit 500,000 per day, and the nation’s fatality rate means that there could be 5700 deaths per day at the peak.
Based on the current rates of infections and deaths, health researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predict there will be almost one million COVID deaths in India by August.
As the situation in India continues to deteriorate, the Australian government is reportedly considering locking down the borders with India.
It comes amid revelations the Perth lockdown was sparked by a man was allowed to travel to India to attend his own wedding.
Countries rally to help send supplies to India
Scott Morrison is set to consider further restricting flights from the country today, with the Prime Minister already announcing last week that flights from the country would be scaled back by 30 per cent.
The Australian government is also considering sending oxygen and ventilators to help with the crisis.
“India is literally gasping for oxygen,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday.
Multiple countries have pledged aid to India, with the US and Britain rushing ventilators and vaccine materials to the country.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country would do “all it can” to help India, with nine airline containers of medical supplies set to arrive in the country on Tuesday.
In the US, the White House said it was making vaccine-production material, therapeutics, tests, ventilators and protective equipment immediately available to India.
France, Germany and Canada have similarly also pledged support.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described the situation in Indian as “beyond heartbreaking”.
“WHO is doing everything we can, providing critical equipment and supplies,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.
He said the UN health agency was among other things sending “thousands of oxygen concentrators, prefabricated mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies”.
The WHO also said it had transferred more than 2600 of its experts from various programs, including polio and tuberculosis, to work with Indian health authorities to help respond to the pandemic.

A raft of interim rules will come into place when the Perth and Peel lockdown lifts tonight. These are all the restrictions in place until Saturday.
Perth and the Peel region will come out of lockdown as planned tonight, but some COVID-19 restrictions will remain in place until at least the end of the week, including the use of masks.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt beat West Australian Premier Mark McGowan to the announcement that there were no new cases of local transmission overnight.
“Australia has recorded zero community cases in the last 24 hours,” Mr Hunt told reporters on Monday.
Mr McGowan fronted the media almost an hour later to announce the Perth and Peel regions would come out of the snap three-day lockdown as planned at midnight.
“The short three-day lockdown has done the job it was designed to do. It was a circuit breaker we needed to limit community spread and keep our community healthy,” he told reporters on Monday.
“At midnight tonight, the lockdown will end as planned. Interim restrictions will come into force from midnight tonight, allowing us to take a stepped-down approach after the three-day lockdown.
“We need to be cautious as we come out of lockdown as the virus could still be out there.
“This step down approach will give us confidence to begin to get back to normal while we wait for further testing and the incubation period of the virus to come to an end.”
Interim restrictions will be in place until midnight on Friday, with the Premier to announce the next steps forward that day.
From tomorrow, people in the Perth and Peel regions will be free to leave their homes, but masks will remain mandatory.
Masks are not required for primary school children, for vigorous outdoor exercise and for people who are exempt.
“For the next four days, people can return to work unless they can work from home or they are in a vulnerable category,” Mr McGowan said.
Schools will resume and staff are permitted to remove their masks while teaching.
Tafes can also open but universities are only open for online learning.
People can travel outside of the Perth and Peel regions, but they must wear a mask.
“If you currently are in another region, and have been in Perth and Peel since April 17, you will need to continue to wear a mask from tomorrow onwards,” Mr McGowan said.
There will be a 20-person limit in all homes, and at private indoor and outdoor gatherings.
Hospitality and entertainment venues, as well as retail outlets, can reopen, except for the casino, nightclubs and indoor fitness venues.
The 4 sqm capacity rule will be in place, with a limit of 20 patrons, not including staff.
Seated service will only be allowed for the next four days at hospitality venues, like pubs and restaurants.
“I know this makes it tough for many businesses,” Mr McGowan said.
“But it’s important we remain cautious and ease off restrictions in line with health advice so we can get back to normal as soon as possible.”
Weddings and funerals can apply for an exemption to have 100 people, as they have done during the lockdown.
Community sport and training can proceed with players and officials, but no spectators.
Visitors to hospitals, as well as aged care and disability aged care facilities, are restricted to compassionate grounds only.
Health Minister Roger Cook further announced there would be some changes to elective surgery.
“The focus will be on category one and urgent category two elective surgeries for the next four days,” he said.
“Non-urgent category two’s and all category three’s will be rescheduled.”
All non-urgent outpatients and community health visits will also be conducted via Telehealth if possible or rescheduled.
Mr Cook said impacted patients would be contacted.
The lockdown was sparked by a Victorian man who was released from hotel quarantine then unwittingly spread the virus to his friend in Kardinya.
It was later discovered a fellow restaurant diner also contracted the virus from the man.
The Victorian man caught the virus from another man quarantining in an opposite room at the Mercure Hotel.
That man had been to India to attend his own wedding and he also passed on the virus to his wife, as well as a pregnant woman and her daughter who were staying in another opposite room.
Mr McGowan last week said the Mercure Hotel would no longer be used to quarantine returned travellers because it was not the most suitable facility.
Since Friday, there have been almost 30,000 tests conducted in Western Australia.
Of the 354 close contacts, 222 have returned a negative test result so far, with other results pending.
From the close contacts, 50 people were linked to the Kitchen Inn restaurant in Kardinya and all 50 had returned negative test results.
Mr McGowan said there were 748 casual contacts and 329 had returned a negative result so far.
On Sunday, 259 people, including children, were tested at a Lansdale childcare centre that was exposed to the virus and so far 212 people had returned a negative result.
Chief health officer Andy Robertson said if the last time the infected man was in the community was April 23, then the state could get cases for up to 14 days after that.
“We will have to take that into consideration when we are making a decision about what the next steps are and whether there will be any continuing restrictions,” he said.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid told Sky News the snap lockdown was “preventable” given a report had found the Mercure Hotel was a weak link in the quarantine system.
Dr Khorshid said it was a “very similar event” to the one that occurred in February in Perth as it related to a likely “airborne transmission” of the virus between rooms in the hotel.
He said the hotel was found by the government’s own report, which was available in early April, to be “not suitable for hotel quarantine” due to ventilation problems.
“It’s unfortunately a little like Groundhog Day,” he said on Monday.
“It is frustratingly slow and, I think, really that is the main criticism of the WA government here — that they have not done everything that they could have done to make hotel quarantine as safe as possible.”
Dr Robertson said the report he saw on April 8 said all of the quarantine hotels could continue to be used “with mitigations”.
“That’s what the report actually says. It doesn’t say that they couldn’t be used,” he said.
Dr Khorshid said more could be done to improve the quarantine system across Australia.
“We’re going to be needing quarantine for many months and potentially years into the future — who knows when the next pandemic is coming?” he said.
“It does make sense to be now investing in Commonwealth run and funded quarantine facilities in each state and territory so that we’re not relying on these hotels that were really never built for this purpose for too much longer.”
But Dr Khorshid said Mr McGowan’s repeated calls to use current Commonwealth facilities was not very realistic.
“There’s major downsides to all of the potential Commonwealth facilities that are available,” Dr Khorshid said.
“What we need to do is create new ones.”

Days after millions of Perth residents were forced into lockdown, just one new case has been found, so are snap shutdowns worth the pain?
Short lockdowns to address COVID-19 outbreaks may not be worth the economic pain they inflict, with just one new locally acquired case identified in Western Australia since a three-day shutdown was introduced.
About two million residents in the Perth and Peel regions have been in lockdown since Friday, with the decision to introduce restrictions ahead of the Anzac Day long weekend meaning businesses lost up to $25 million in revenue, according to Restaurant and Catering Australia chief executive officer Wes Lambert.
Mr Lambert told ABC the timing meant businesses had to donate or throw away $7 million in produce and stock.
“Because it was Friday afternoon … they would’ve already been prepping for the weekend, they would’ve been making their stocks and soups and they would’ve already been grazing things,” Mr Lambert said.
It’s the second lockdown residents have endured this year, with a five-day lockdown of Perth and Peel in January lifted without any further cases being detected after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive.
WA Premier Mark McGowan confirmed the lockdown would be lifted on Monday night and told reporters the lockdown had “delivered the results that we needed”.
“The short three day lockdown has done the job it was designed to do. It was a circuit breaker we needed to limit community spread and keep our community healthy,” he said.
However, infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collignon told news.com.au he was not convinced short lockdowns had made much difference in controlling cases in WA or other states.
He said there had been several short lockdowns related to hotel quarantine breaches, including two in Perth, one in Adelaide, one in Melbourne and two in Auckland, New Zealand.
“As far as I can see, there have been no COVID cases found that were not close contacts of a known case, or someone who had been to a (exposure site) venue, and these contacts would normally already be asked to quarantine” he said.
RELATED: No new local cases in Western Australia
Prof Collignon acknowledged there were circumstances where a wider lockdown was necessary, for example, if there were a number of cases in the community for which there was no known source, but this hadn’t been the case so far.
“If Perth had had five or six cases where we didn’t know where they came from, (a lockdown may be necessary) but it didn’t have that,” Prof Collignon said.
Short lockdowns have been touted as a “circuit-breaker” to limit the contact people have with each other, which helps stop the spread of the virus, and give authorities time to get on top of the situation.
Prof Collignon said the contact tracers seemed to be the only ones helped by lockdowns, as it gave them more time to do their job: contacting everyone who may have been exposed to the disease and asking them to isolate before they could spread the virus.
“I don’t see that (short) lockdowns are making any difference to finding cases but there is a huge social and economic cost,” he said.
Prof Collignon said the WA lockdown had seen two million forced to stay home compared to just tens of thousands in NSW during an outbreak beginning in December last year.
In NSW only those in Sydney’s northern beaches were told to isolate as the state did not introduce a snap lockdown of the entire city.
Its approach focused on contact tracing and asked only those who had been in close contact with positive cases, or who had visited certain venues, to isolate.
“I think short lockdowns are very disruptive for almost no extra benefit in controlling the infection,” Prof Collignon said.
However, even the NSW approach has significant economic consequences, with KPMG modelling estimating the outbreak cost the state’s economy $3.2 billion in lost working hours in December.
RELATED: Border fury as new restrictions expected
Western Australia’s most recent lockdown was introduced after a man aged in his 50s was infected with COVID-19 while in hotel quarantine, although he was not diagnosed for many days after leaving.
He visited several locations in Perth over five days and gave the virus to a female friend who he stayed with, as well as someone who went to the same restaurant.
The man later tested positive after arriving in Melbourne on April 21.
The case has also raised questions about hotel quarantine practices, although WA Premier Mark McGowan has focused debate on whether the Commonwealth should take more responsibility for quarantining returned travellers.
“We’ve been shouldering, and the States have been shouldering, all the load in hotels that were never built for this purpose now for 14 months,” Mr McGowan said on Sunday.
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has hit back at his comments saying Mr McGowan agreed to the existing quarantine system last March, The West Australian reported.
She said the Federal Government’s detention facilities and Australian Defence Force bases were not fit for quarantine and that Mr McGowan was “very much aware of that”.
Ms Andrews also noted that NSW was “doing extremely well with a significant number of returned travellers coming through” and that “maybe it’s time to make the call to Gladys Berejiklian to see what can be learnt by other Premiers and first Ministers”.

A paramedic has been forced into quarantine after possibly being exposed to COVID-19 while transporting a sick patient.
A St John Ambulance paramedic has been forced into self-quarantine after possibly being exposed to COVID-19 while transporting a patient in Perth.
The incident happened last Friday during a hospital transfer from hotel quarantine, St John Ambulance has confirmed.
All ambulances can safely transfer coronavirus-affected patients, but two vehicles have specialised isolation, meaning they are fitted with additional infection control measures.
A St John Ambulance spokeswoman said there had been an issue relating to air flow, which had since been repaired.
“Both (SIA) vehicles have been inspected and are fully operational,” she said in a statement on Monday.
“As a precautionary measure, one paramedic who had worked in the SIA vehicle is in home quarantine. That person is fully vaccinated.”
The Perth and Peel regions in Western Australia are on the final day of a three-day lockdown, sparked by a Victorian man who was released from hotel quarantine and unwittingly spread the virus to a friend and a fellow restaurant diner.
Premier Mark McGowan will hold a press conference later on Monday to announce whether the lockdown will be extended.

Several Australian cricketers have withdrawn from India’s glamorous T20 tournament as the country’s COVID-19 crisis escalates.

According to Health Ministry data, India has registered more than one million infections over the past four days, taking the country’s total number of cases beyond 17 million.
News.com.au confirmed Australia is considering even tougher restrictions on flights from India in the next 24 hours amid revelations the Perth lockdown was sparked by a man’s overseas holiday to attend his own wedding.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison will convene a meeting of the national security committee of cabinet on Tuesday to consider a further reduction in flights.
Several Australian cricketers — including Steve Smith, David Warner, Pat Cummins and Glenn Maxwell — are currently competing in the Indian Premier League, not scheduled to fly home for several weeks.
The Rajasthan Royals released a statement on Twitter on Sunday evening, revealing Tye had returned to Australia “due to personal reasons”.
AJ Tye flew back to Australia earlier today due to personal reasons. We will continue to offer any support he may need.#RoyalsFamily
Speaking to SEN Breakfast with Gilly & Goss on Monday morning, the 34-year-old said the decision was made because he feared being locked out of Australia, also citing bubble fatigue.
“I just thought to try and get on the front foot and get home before I get locked out of the country. It’s been a long time in a hub – I was doing the calculations earlier and I think I’ve had 11 days at home out of bubbles and hubs since August,” Tye said.
“There’s definitely concerns, a lot of guys have been in touch. Some other guys are very interested in what route I took home and how I approached it. Other guys are happy to know I’m OK and make sure I’m in a good space.
“There is some concern and I’m not sure if I’ll be the only one, but that’s too early for me to say.
“You can look at it from different points of view … an Indian point of view is; how are these companies and franchises spending so much money on the game and able to spend so much money on the IPL when there’s people not being able to be accepted into hospital?”
Later on Monday, the Royal Challengers Bangalore revealed Zampa and Richardson were also returning to Australia for “personal reasons”.

Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association released a joint statement on Monday afternoon: “CA and the ACA remain in regular contact with Australian players, coaches and commentators taking part in the Indian Premier League, which is being conducted under strict biosecurity protocols.
“We will continue to listen to feedback from those on the ground in India and the advice of the Australian Government.
“Our thoughts are with the people of India at this difficult time.”
The IPL’s players and staff are confined in strict hotel biosecurity bubbles, flying between cities on chartered jets.
Delhi & Districts Cricket Association president Rohan Jaitley told ESPNcricinfo this week: “The bubble is absolutely intact … if I am not part of the bubble, I can’t meet anybody (inside it). It is absolutely safe.”
Despite the setbacks, the BCCI has opted not to postpone or abandon any matches. The financial losses would be monumental.
The Age’s Daniel Cherny reported that several Australian cricketers were seeking to leave the glamorous T20 tournament early, fearing they will be locked out of the country.
According to the report, the cricket stars are having difficulty finding a connecting flight.
It appears that Andrew Tye will be just the first of a number of Australians seeking to leave the IPL early, the biggest issue for them being whether the Aus Govt may tighten travel restrictions from India to the point where they aren't allowed to return home
“Everyone’s sort of a bit nervous about whether they can get back into Australia. I dare say there’ll be a few other Australians a bit nervous about getting back into Australia,” former Victorian batsman David Hussey told the publication from India.
“It’s on the news every minute of the day. You see people in hospital beds. It puts a lot of things in perspective. We actually discussed after the game last night, how lucky we are to play the game and try to entertain people around the world.
“Everyone’s pretty nervous about what’s going on over here, but they’re also pragmatic.
“From a Kolkata point of view, we’re desperate for the tournament to keep going, purely because everyone’s in lockdown, there’s not much else to do.”
Meanwhile, Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin announced he would also be leaving the Indian Premier League to be with his family.
I would be taking a break from this years IPL from tomorrow. My family and extended family are putting up a fight against #COVID19 and I want to support them during these tough times. I expect to return to play if things go in the right direction. Thank you @DelhiCapitals ðð
Earlier this month, Australian all-rounder Daniel Sams tested positive to COVID-19 while serving hotel quarantine, along with Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate Devdutt Padikkal.
Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting spoke openly about the “grim” situation on Saturday: “This IPL, probably more than any other, has become more about what’s happening outside than what’s happening here.
“We right now are probably the safest people in the country being in the bubbles that we are in. Continually I’m asking the boys at breakfast every day how’s everything going on the outside.
“It is really important, we are thinking about the extended family, not just us, but we’ve got to be talking about what’s happening outside because it is quite grim.”

Last week, the United Kingdom added India to a “red list” of countries from which most travel is banned, over fears of a new COVID variant.
According to the BBC, England’s IPL stars will be allowed to return home but must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.
The decision could prove a logistic nightmare for English and Kiwi Test cricketers taking part in the T20 tournament.
The IPL Final is scheduled for Sunday, May 30, while the first Test between England and New Zealand commences in London three days later on Wednesday, June 3.
Cricket broadcaster Raunak Kapoor says the silence from the IPL about the situation unfolding outside of their bio-secure bubbles is deafening.
“If they tweet on the situation, they acknowledge the crisis. If they acknowledge the crisis, they acknowledge the government’s failure. If they acknowledge the government’s failure, they think they’ll get into trouble,” Kapoor tweeted.
“The problem is not the IPL. It’s just the lack of acknowledgment.
“I don’t blame the IPL. If anything the tournament got lucky with everything being in place before things got alarmingly worse. And cancelling it does nothing. Just acknowledge & empathise with the people. They’re people. Not just a target audience.
“Sport is a platform. One that reaches people. If the people are suffering, or in pain, reach out to them. Show them you care. Show the people of India that the sport & its icons care about them. Of course you can do more, but this is the very least.”
Honestly, the IPL is what's keeping me sane right now. Another death today (4th in 10 days) among people I knew. I'd have lost it if not for the IPL.
Australia’s highest-profile cricketers have been stuck in limbo since the Indian travel ban but could be among the first citizens to return home.

A Subway, chemist and green grocer are among new COVID-19 exposure sites in Perth, as the city braces for a decision on lockdown.
As millions of Perth and Peel residents await a decision on whether the snap lockdown will end on Tuesday, Western Australia Health has added a Subway, grocer and chemist to their extensive contact tracing list.
WA Orchard Fruit and Veg shop in Perth was visited by a COVID-positive case on April 19 between 5.25pm – 6.25pm.
Health authorities said further information had been provided and more CCTV footage analysed, resulting in them also adding Bentley Subway, visited on April 22 between 11.45am -12.30pm; and Chemist Warehouse Joondalup, visited on April 22 between 8pm – 9pm.
Affected customers have been ordered to get tested and quarantine for 14 days regardless of the test result from the time of potential exposure.
WA Health has also amended the exposure times at a number of restaurants, based on further advice from COVID-positive cases.
Anyone who visited Kung Fu Kitchen in Morley between 6pm – 8pm on April 21, Fortune Five Dim Sim in Northbridge between 8pm – 9.30pm on April 18, and Thai Thymes Joondalup between 6.30pm-8pm on April 22 must also get tested and self-quarantine for 14 days from exposure time.
Two Bentley locations visited on April 20 – Jumbo BBQ Roast Duck House (between 12pm-12.30pm) and Woolworths Bentley Plaza (between 11.15am-12.15pm)– have been removed.
The update comes hours before WA Premier Mark McGowan is set to announce whether the state will be released from its snap lockdown from Friday.
On Sunday, Mr McGowan pleaded for anyone who had visited the exposure sites to be tested.
“Please, keep doing the right thing,” he said.
“We all work together, it gives us the best chance to come out of lockdown and safely get back to normal.”
The Premier refused to confirm on Sunday afternoon if he would end the lockdown on time as planned, saying it was “too early to predict” what would happen and suggesting some measures would stay in place.
As of Sunday, Mr McGowan said 359 close and causal contacts of the confirmed cases had been identified.

WA Premier Mark McGowan has refused to say whether the snap three-day lockdown will end on Tuesday as planned, despite no new locally-acquired cases.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has stayed mum on when the Perth and Peel region lockdown will end, despite no new locally-acquired cases emerging overnight.
Excluding the security guard who became infected working at the Four Points quarantine hotel in January, WA broke its more than 12 month dream run of no community transmission last week when a Victorian man unwittingly contracted the virus while in quarantine at the Mercure Hotel.
He stayed in a room opposite an ill couple who had arrived from India, then spent five days in the community, where he infected a friend.
The pair went to the Kitchen Inn restaurant in her home suburb of Kardinya, where a man in his 40s then contracted the virus.
“Right now it’s too early to predict what will happen come Tuesday,” Mr McGowan told reporters on Sunday.
“We need to see more testing completed. Most importantly we need close contacts and casual contacts - that is anyone who has visited the exposure locations during the specific times - to be tested.
“So please keep doing the right thing.
“We all work together, it gives us the best chance to come out of lockdown and safely get back to normal.”
Mr McGowan said health authorities would “expect there to be more cases” recorded in the community and apologised for the “debilitating” situation.
The Premier said there would be “further measures” that continued beyond the lockdown period, but would not be making any announcement on the details until Monday.
“I’m sure there will be some further measures that continue. What they are, we won’t know until tomorrow morning,” he said.
“We’ll get health advice ... and I think people should get used to the prospect that there will be some further measures continue beyond Monday.
“What they are exactly at this point in time we don’t have but we’ll work them out over the coming 24 hours.”
Mr McGowan said health authorities had identified 359 close and casual contacts of the confirmed cases.
Of 303 close contacts, 72 had returned a negative result, as had 13 of 56 casual contacts.

A young child has tested positive to COVID-19 after flying home from India.
A young child has tested positive for COVID-19 after returning to Australia from coronavirus-ravaged India.
The Northern Territory Government announced in a statement on Sunday the boy, 2, has returned a positive result for the virus after flying in from New Delhi earlier this month.
He is currently in the territory’s quarantine facility at Howard Springs, and has been since his arrival in the country.

India was last week declared a “high-risk” location as the Australian government slashed arrivals from the subcontinental country in the grips of a devastating outbreak.
India recorded 346,786 new infections on Saturday, setting a world record for the third consecutive day.
It is not yet known if the outbreak is being fuelled by a strain first identified in the country in October known officially as B. 1.616 – but referred to as the “double mutant” strain.
Flights from India to Australia have been slashed by 30 per cent.
Last week Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared Australians will only be permitted to travel to a high-risk country under “very urgent circumstances”.
“An arrangement where if you have been in a high-risk country in the previous 14 days, before getting on your last point of embarkation to Australia, then you would need to have had a PCR test 72 hours before leaving that last point of embarkation,” he said.
“This would apply to India.”
A man who returned to Western Australia from India has been identified as the source of an outbreak in Perth, which saw the capital city and Peel region placed into a snap three-day lockdown.
The total number of cases diagnosed in the Northern Territory now stands at 161.
All cases have been linked to international or interstate travel, with no community transmission.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/us-family-charged-for-selling-bleach-as-miracle-remedy-for-covid19-out-of-florida-church/news-story/557e1e318f202f647b9938ca423510d9
A sickening family operation netted millions of dollars selling “miracle” remedies to fight coronavirus. This is what they were really selling.
A US family selling bleach disguised as a “miracle” remedy for a wide range of medical afflictions has been busted in Florida.
A federal grand jury in Miami returned an indictment charging 62-year-old Mark Grenon and his three sons Jonathan Grenon, 34, Jordan Grenon, 26, and Joseph Grenon, 32 with fraud after their extensive operation allowed the dodgy cure to land in the hands of thousands of vulnerable people searching for remedies.
The indictment found the family manufactured a product called the “Miracle Mineral Solution”, which was revealed to be a chemical solution containing sodium chlorite and water. If ingested orally, the solution becomes chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach “typically used for industrial water treatment or bleaching textiles, pulp, and paper”.
The family allegedly used the current hysteria over COVID-19 as a springboard for their business, claiming the toxic product could “treat, prevent, and cure” the virus.
The US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) had not approved MMS for treatment of COVID-19, rather sending out a public health warning against taking the misleading remedy, which can cause severe vomiting, diarrhoea, and life-threatening low blood pressure.
The indictment alleged the family sold their bleach solution under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, which claims the product was first invented in 1996 by a man named Jim Humble as a cure for malaria.
The Genesis II Church — which family senior and defendant Mark Grenon claims “has nothing to do with religion” — has been accused as being a front for the family to traverse loopholes in the legal system to distribute their product.
The church claims over 20 million people have taken the Miracle Mineral Solution, providing a long list of supposed testimonials from people suffering everything between abscesses, scabies and gangrene.
“MMS has proven to restore partial or full health to hundreds of thousands of people suffering from a wide range of diseases. MMS is a weak oxidiser that when used properly can run through the human body destroying disease pathogens and the poisons that they create, while doing no harm to the body,” the church’s website said.
Twenty-three testimonials on the church’s website claim MMS was an effective treatment against their case of coronavirus, while a further 42 posts claim the solution was an effective remedy for autism.
“Please do not pay attention to this video most of (sic) This YouTubers are been paying by big pharmaceutical industries to lie about Clorine dioxide calling this wonderful mineral a bleach,” read a testimonial posted by an account named Claudia Holistic Healing in November 2020.
“I wan (sic) to share my testimony bout (sic) how this mineral heal (sic) my mom from diabetes and myself from COVID-19.”
David Gorski of Science-Based Medicine said the fact the bleach solution had conned so many buyers was “quackery”.
“There are some forms of quackery that I’ve never been able to understand, quackery that is so bizarre, so without a reasonable scientific rationale, and so potentially harmful that it boggles my mind that anyone would ever think it is a good idea,” he said.
“Feeding autistic children bleach or, even worse, subjecting them to bleach enemas, is horrifying—and, yes, this is really a thing.”
But the circus surrounding the Grenon family doesn’t stop there. The United States previously filed a civil case against the defendants and the Genesis II Church for criminal contempt, following a dispute over the distribution of MMS in 2020.
The Grenon family allegedly threatened the federal judge presiding over the case and warned they would “pick up guns” should the government continue to get in the way of their remedy hustle.
Officers carrying out a warrant for Jonathan Grenon’s home found “dozens of blue chemical drums containing nearly 10,000 pounds of sodium chlorite powder” and thousands of bottles of MMS ready for distribution, federal prosecutors told a Miami court.
Strewn among the clandestine operation were multiple loaded firearms, including a pump-action shotgun concealed in a violin case.
Each of the Grenons has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and two counts of criminal contempt. They face life imprisonment if found guilty.
Jordan and Jonathan have been detained since the arrest, but officers are still on the hunt for Mark and his middle son Joseph, who are now believed to have left the country for Columbia.

Some 225,000 residents in one state have been told to monitor for symptoms after a worrying discovery by health officials.
More than 225,000 people in the Newcastle area have been urged to monitor for potential symptoms of COVID-19 after fragments of the virus were found in a wastewater treatment plant.
A sample taken on April 21 showed fragments of the virus that causes COVID-19 in the sewage system at Burwood Beach Sewage Treatment Plant.
The Burwood Beach catchment services about 225,000 people and takes in the Newcastle City area.
It also services Dudley, Charlestown, Jesmond, Lambton, New Lambton, Mayfield, Elermore Vale, Wallsend, Kotara, Garden Suburb, Adamstown Heights, Kahibah, Highfields, Merewether, Waratah West, Georgetown and Carrington.
NSW Health officials are concerned because it is not clear whether there are cases in the community or whether the fragments are from historical cases.
“These positive sewage results may indicate the presence of people who have recently recovered from COVID-19, as they can continue to shed fragments of the virus for several weeks after recovery,” NSW Health said in a release.
Residents in greater Newcastle should monitor for symptoms and get tested if any develop.
It comes after news on Saturday that COVID-19 was detected in sewage systems at Allambie Heights (sampled April 22), on Sydney’s northern beaches, as well as Merimbula (April 21) on the state’s far south coast.
The Allambie Heights sewage network serves about 83,400 people in the Northern Head catchment and the Merimbula sewage treatment plant serves about 15,000 residents.
NSW recorded no new locally acquired cases overnight while one new case was recorded by an overseas traveller.
Meanwhile, residents in Perth and the Peel region are on their second day of a three-day snap lockdown as the city deals with a COVID-19 outbreak.
People who have arrived in Sydney from Western Australia since 12.01am on Saturday must complete a declaration which confirms they have not attended a venue of concern.
If you have attended any of the close or casual contact venues and you are already in NSW, you should immediately self-isolate and call NSW Health on 1800 943 553.

Eerie scenes unfolded at Optus Stadium on Saturday night as the Dockers hosted the Kangaroos for the first match without a crowd this season.
Fremantle did what it needed to do at Optus Stadium on Saturday night. The Dockers beat bottom side North Melbourne by 51 points in front of empty stands.
Led by experienced pair David Mundy and Nat Fyfe and rising stars Caleb Serong and Andrew Brayshaw, the Dockers got out to a good start and finished well to win strongly, 14.15 (99) to 6.12 (48).
But the Kangaroos were able to do something they haven’t done in five previous rounds this season – they got their hands on the footy.
Generally, the Dockers controlled the game, but for the first time this season, the Kangaroos had more disposals than their opposition – 397-390.
At times they tried to move the ball too fast and they turned it over a lot; but they showed on occasion a willingness to deliberately slow the play and keep hold of the ball.
They amassed 265 uncontested possessions; their best return for the season.
Fremantle did enough to comfortably win their third consecutive game.
JACK IN THE BACK
Regardless of the possession count, again the Roos looked out of sorts as they went forward.
Most of the good work they did was in defence and Jack Ziebell, with 37 touches, led the way.
Those who say he just pushed up his stats though are underplaying the way he is putting his body on the line for his team.
Ziebell took 14 marks, a heap of those intercepting forward pushes that could easily have ended in Dockers goals. The margin would have been much greater without him.
DOCKERS’ KICKING WOES
Fremantle is doing itself no favours in front of goal either and wasting an opportunity to significantly improve its percentage.
For the sixth consecutive week, they kicked more behinds than points, adding to the 53.71 they had on the board going into Round 6.
Their skipper and dual Brownlow medallist is one of the main culprits. His tally of 0.4 added to the 1.8 he’d kicked in his previous four outings in 2021.
James Aish (0.2), Serong (0.2) and Michael Fredrick (0.2) were also repeat offenders, missing shots they should have made.
INTO THE UNKNOWN
North Melbourne flew into Perth just as the WA government announced a three-day lockdown due to two positive community-spread COVID-19 cases.
But the Roos officials said the impact on the side was minimal; although not everyone, including runner Brent Harvey, were unable to attend the game.
It took the Roos 10 minutes to settle into the game, played without any spectators.
Fremantle brought the effort to the contest early and led the contested possessions count 1608 after just 10 minutes.
Fortunately for North, the Dockers couldn’t put the scoreboard pressure on that they had earned.
It was almost 10 minutes into the game that the Roos had their first possessions inside their forward line.
Cameron Zurhaar missed the shot on goal, but it triggered something in his team.
Fremantle led by just eight points at the first break, after Matt Taberner kicked a goal from a mark that, without a crowd in attendance, the umpire was able to judge he marked just before the siren sounded.
The disruptions look certain to continue to North Melbourne, however. As the side ran out on to the ground on Saturday night, they had not heard when they would be able to fly out of Perth, or whether their Round 7 clash against Melbourne could still go ahead in Tasmania.
THE YOUNG AND THE OLD
Fremantle dominated the second term and opened a 28-point lead at halftime. The lead had been as high as 35-points as the home side took control.
North were using Ben Cunnington and Kayne Turner in stopping roles, but the Dockers midfield was too difficult to stop.
Veteran Mundy was in everything, as he has been throughout the early stages of this season.
Surely there are no questions lingering as to whether the 35-year old will play on in 2022.
Mundy had 20 touches, six clearances and kicked two goals in the first half.
And he wasn’t the only Docker who seemed the have a ball on a string in that first half.
Serong, the 2020 AFL Rising Star, had collected 18 possessions, 10 of them contested and had helped the Dockers take advantage in clearances, with five.

Mr McGowan also mentioned the cases recorded in quarantine.

“This includes the one local case of a woman in her 40s who was the close contact of the Victorian man that we reported yesterday. The other relates to a woman in her 50s who was a returned traveller from India, in hotel quarantine. This means there are no new local cases of COVID-19 other than those ones we reported yesterday.

“In total to date, we have identified 337 contacts, including 71 close contacts. They have all been tested or will be today. They will remain in quarantine. So far 27 close contacts have tested negative. 

“There are currently 109 casual contacts with 60 of those returning a negative result so far. In addition, there are currently 157 other contacts, which are pending classification by our public health team.”

WA has recorded one new cases of COVID-19 as the Premier demanded the Morrison government ‘step up and help’ following a quarantine blunder.
Western Australia has recorded one new local case of COVID-19 overnight, as the Premier renewed his push for Commonwealth facilities to be used instead of hotels, saying he was “getting to the end” of his tether.
The state is on day one of a three-day lockdown, sparked after a 54-year-old Victorian man unwittingly contracted COVID-19 in quarantine at the Mercure Hotel in Perth then spread the virus in the community.
At his press conference on Saturday, Premier Mark McGowan said there had been no new cases overnight, but the Health Department later issued a statement saying there had been one.
“The WA Health Department has this afternoon confirmed a positive test result has been returned from a person within the community,” the statement read.
“The person presented for a COVID-19 test yesterday as they had attended one of the locations visited by the confirmed COVID-19 Victorian case, and the related local case.
“The person is now working closely with the department’s contact tracing team to determine public exposure sites.”
A Health Department spokeswoman confirmed a man aged in his 40s picked up the virus at the Kitchen Inn in Kardinya where the Victorian man dined last weekend.
Breaking, bad news: 1 new locally acquired Covid case CONFIRMED. A diner at the Kitchen Inn in Kardinya @7NewsPerth ð· pic.twitter.com/zG3kAZCrQF
Health authorities said all restaurants where cases had dined-in were of higher risk.
Anyone who has been to the following restaurants must isolate immediately:
“You must get tested and complete the full 14 days of self-quarantine regardless of your test result,” the Health Department said.
If you have not yet been contacted by Public Health Operations, you can call 13 COVID (13 26843).
Public Health Operations will provide guidance on testing and quarantine.
Mr McGowan said CBD hotels were not fit for purpose quarantine facilities, adding quarantine was the responsibility of the Commonwealth government.
“There are a number of Commonwealth facilities that would be more suitable for quarantine purposes,” he told reporters on Saturday.
“The pandemic will be here for at least the rest of this year. It is time for the Commonwealth to step up and help.
“My government stands ready to work with them and help establish Commonwealth quarantine facilities.
“They have a range of facilities available. It’s the only way to help reduce the risk further.
“We cannot continue down this path for another year or beyond.”
Mr McGowan suggested facilities like Christmas Island and Curtin Airbase should be used because they were purpose-built to quarantine people and were isolated.
“I’m getting to the end of my tether with the Commonwealth handing responsibility to the states and not helping,” he said.
Mr McGowan also expressed disappointment that some people were competing in sport or attending funerals overseas, then returning to Australia with the virus and putting others at risk, saying “it has to stop”.
Earlier in the week, the Premier requested the state halve its intake of arrivals.
The only other new case that was reported overnight was a woman aged in her 50s, who is a returned overseas traveller from India in hotel quarantine.
Mr McGowan thanked the community for co-operating during the lockdown and described it as a “serious situation”.
“This has been a rapidly evolving situation. I know it has been difficult and I know it has been frustrating,” he said.
“But if we can all work together and do the right thing over the next few days we will increase our chances of stopping the virus in its tracks — just like we’ve done before.
“The early signs have been encouraging. People have largely listened to the instructions and done the right thing.”
More than 4000 tests were conducted at public and private COVID clinics on Friday.
So far, 337 contacts have been identified for the Victorian man and Perth woman, including 71 close contacts.
Mr McGowan said 27 close contacts had so far tested negative.
There are currently 109 casual contacts, with 60 of those returning a negative result so far.
In addition, there are currently 157 other contacts, which are pending classification by health officials.
“These are encouraging signs but it is still early days,” Mr McGowan said.
Mr McGowan said a total of 24 guests were on the affected floor at the Mercure Hotel during the specific period and five had left Australia.
Eighteen had tested negative and the only positive case was the Victorian man.
Various hotel quarantine staff worked on the floor during the same period, with 57 returning a negative result. Two results are pending.
“Hotel quarantine is an imperfect system but it is the best system we have and largely it has worked well, with around 45,000 returning Australians being processed through the West Australian system,” Mr McGowan said.
Police set up eight vehicle checkpoints overnight and up until 8am on Saturday officers had turned back 60 vehicles who did not have a valid reason to be travelling outside of the Perth and Peel regions.
Commissioner Chris Dawson said a woman was fined for not wearing a mask at a rugby match on Friday night.
“I would characterise it as having failed the attitude test, so she has been issued with a $1000 infringement. We have had no other infringements to date,” he said.
Health Minister Roger Cook urged people to use the Safe WA app.
“What you saw yesterday was a well-drilled operation to establish where the two infected people moved around Perth,” he said.
“It was very helpful that the woman had been using the safe Western Australian app and I commend her for doing so.”
A dental clinic employee was earlier revealed as Western Australia’s first case of COVID-19 involving community transmission in more than a year.
The Victorian man stayed at the woman’s Kardinya home for one night before moving to Saint Catherine’s College at the University of Western Australia.
Her workplace, DB Dental on Canning Highway in Applecross, has been added to the list of public exposure sites visited by the pair since he was released from quarantine on April 17.
The woman, aged in her 40s, unwittingly worked at the clinic from 8am to 6pm on Thursday while infectious.
Her two children have so far tested negative for coronavirus.
Other exposure sites include Leisurefit Aquatic Centre in Booragoon, restaurants in Northbridge, Fortune Acupuncture Chinese Medical Clinic in Subiaco and Southlands Shopping Centre in Willetton.
Authorities believe the man contracted the virus while staying in a room opposite an ill couple who arrived from India.
Pregnant mother and nurse Alison Rose, along with her four-year-old daughter, also contracted the virus from the couple.
Mr McGowan on Thursday conceded the Mercure was “not one of the best” hotels for quarantining and would no longer be used for returned travellers.
It will instead be used to house low-risk seasonal workers from Tonga and Vanuatu.
The state Opposition has criticised the government for not dumping the hotel from its list of quarantine locations for returned travellers given a report earlier this month identified it as a risk.
“The government knew in early April that the Mercure Hotel needed work to continue to be used for quarantine,” Opposition leader Mia Davies said.
“They ignored this report, continued to use an unsafe facility, and that decision has led to community transmission and a snap lockdown for millions of West Australians.”
Opposition health spokeswoman Libby Mettam said the Labor government had “continued to ignore the holes in the hotel quarantine system and the warnings” from the chief health officer, adding the situation was “completely avoidable”.
New Zealand and some Australian jurisdictions have effectively shut their borders to Western Australia or enforced tough restrictions on travellers following the outbreak.
The Perth and Peel regions entered day one of a snap three-day lockdown at midnight.
The lockdown is due to end at midnight on Monday but that could change if authorities discover the virus has spread further.
Some people were seen panic buying at supermarkets on Friday, with toilet paper, rice and pasta among the items snapped up.
Meanwhile, popular night-life spots like Northbridge looked like ghost towns on Friday night.
Long lines have been forming at testing clinics since the lockdown was announced, as people scramble to get tested for the virus.
Anzac Day services have been cancelled and people have been urged to pay their respects at dawn from their driveways like they did last year.
Places that are closed during the lockdown:
No visitors are allowed at hospitals, residential aged care or disability facilities unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Weddings and funerals are permitted with a 100-person capacity, but masks must be worn.

Residents in 18 suburbs have been told to monitor for symptoms after a worrying discovery by NSW health authorities.
Coronavirus fragments have been detected in two sewer systems in NSW, health authorities have revealed.
In its daily update on COVID-19 cases, NSW Health flagged the detection of the virus fragments in the Allambie Heights and Merimbula sewer systems, which collectively service about 100,000 people.
No new locally acquired cases of coronavirus were recorded within the state of NSW overnight to 8pm, while one new case was detected in hotel quarantine.
The total number of COVID-19 cases in NSW stands at 5230 since the start of the pandemic.
“NSW Health has been notified that fragments of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been detected in the sewage systems at Allambie Heights and Merimbula,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“These positive sewage results may indicate the presence of people who have recently recovered from COVID-19, as they can continue to shed fragments of the virus for several weeks after recovery.”
Residents in either catchments should monitor for symptoms and get tested if they develop.
The Merimbula treatment plant services roughly 15,000 people on the south coast.
The Allambie Heights treatment plant is located in Sydney’s north, servicing about
83,400 in the Northern Head catchment.
The alert to monitor for symptoms applies for the suburbs of Allambie Heights, Balgowlah, Curl Curl, North Curl Curl, North Manly, Freshwater, Collaroy, Collaroy Plateau, Narrabeen, Wheeler Heights, Oxford Falls, Dee Why, Cromer, Beacon Hill, Narraweena, Brookvale and Frenchs Forest.
NSW Health also said it had administered 2933 vaccine doses in the 24 hours to 8pm, bringing the total number of jabs to 553,275.
The detection of COVID-19 particles comes after the state health department implemented mandatory declaration forms and self-isolation mandates for West Australians arriving in NSW.
From 12.01am on Saturday, people who have been in Perth or Peel must stay at home or self-isolate regardless of their location.
Inbound Western Australia travellers must declare if they have been at any of the exposure sites in Perth and Peel.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/india-reaches-world-record-of-315000-daily-covid19-cases-as-oxygen-supply-runs-out/news-story/cf24fa2c822528e6e1c95d6e696b8750
One of the world’s biggest countries just recorded the world’s worst ever COVID-19 daily rate as oxygen and hospital beds run out and cases soar.
On streets outside hospitals, elderly men and women struggling to breathe are either lucky enough to be strapped to an oxygen tank or dying while waiting for one.
Hospitals across India — a country that just posted a global record of 315,000 new cases in a single day — are so full that ambulances are lined up outside with nowhere to go.
Inside, beds are at 99 per cent capacity and fresh oxygen supplies are not forthcoming.
The country’s long-underfunded healthcare system is being stretched to the limit by a devastating second wave of the pandemic blamed on a “double mutant” variant and “superspreader” mass gatherings.
It is 3:35 a.m in India and I just counted 72 people on my timeline desperately either searching for a bed in a hospital or an oxygen cylinder. These are Indians having access to social media, what is happening in countryside we donât know & with those who donât use Twitter.
This is so painful, India recorded 314000 cases in last 24Hours. Horrible situation in India as country just ran out of Oxygen May Allah have mercy on our neighbours , India ð®ð³ #IndiaNeedsOxygenpic.twitter.com/V6KXAYzC7h
Heartbreaking images from the subcontinent are flooding social media as the hashtag #IndiaNeedsOxygen continues to trend.
One image that went viral shows a mother sitting in an electric rickshaw with the lifeless body of her son at her feet.
Other pictures show bodies waiting to be burned in long queues at crematoriums that continue to burn day and night with no sign of slowing down.
According to Health Ministry data from Thursday, there were 314,835 new infections in just 24 hours. That figure is far greater than any country has recorded since the pandemic began and takes the country’s total cases to almost 16 million.
On the same day, there were 2074 deaths associated with COVID-19, bringing the total death toll to almost 185,000.

The numbers are considerably lower on a per capita basis than in many other countries, raising fears the situation could get a lot worse. There are also accusations the death toll is not being accurately reported.
At several crematoriums, workers are reporting five times the number of bodies being burned compared to the official death toll.
The health system is stretched beyond all comprehension.
A nurse described the situation as “like hell” to Time reporter Rana Ayyub.
“This is hell, you tell me, is this not?” the nurse said, who is recovering from COVID-19 and asked not to be named.
“They talk of worshipping the medical fraternity but they have left us to die.”
Major private and government-run hospitals in New Delhi are so overwhelmed that they’ve sent out urgent appeals to the central government, calling for more oxygen supplies for hundreds of patients on ventilator support.
Videos show trucks carrying oxygen under police escort.
On Wednesday, nearly 500 tonnes of oxygen was supplied to Delhi but this fell short of the required 700 tonnes per day.
The megacity’s government, run by a different party to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s national administration, has accused neighbouring states governed by Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of holding up supplies.
Court orders government to ‘beg, borrow, steal’ oxygen
Late Wednesday, the Delhi High Court ordered the government to ensure safe passage of oxygen supplies from factories to hospitals across India.
“You beg, borrow and steal but have to provide,” the judges said, asking why the government is “not waking up to the gravity of the situation”.
“In the last few days there has been a mad scramble for oxygen. One hospital or the other is running short,” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday.
“Now oxygen supply is coming … we are trying to ensure every truck carrying oxygen reaches the hospitals,” he said, adding that he had requested oxygen be flown from the eastern state of Odisha.
Recent months have seen mass gatherings in India, including millions attending the Kumbh Mela religious festival, political rallies, lavish weddings and cricket matches with spectators.
Now, states across India have imposed restrictions, with Delhi in a week-long lockdown, all non-essential shops shut in Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh set for a weekend shutdown.
However, on Thursday, Mr Modi still urged voters in West Bengal “to exercise their franchise” as parts of the eastern state voted.
Distraught relatives are now being forced to pay exorbitant rates on the black market for medicines and oxygen, while WhatsApp groups are full of desperate pleas for help.
The United States now advises against travel to India, even for those fully vaccinated, while Britain has put India on its “red list” and Hong Kong and New Zealand have banned flights.
Australia on Thursday also tightened restrictions on arrivals from India, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying returnees from there now made up about 40 per cent of COVID cases detected in quarantine.
Is new COVID-19 variant responsible?
Questions are being asked about whether new mutations, specifically B. 1.617, is behind what is currently the world’s fastest-growing outbreak.
The B. 1.617 variant has already appeared elsewhere, including in the United States, Australia, Israel and Singapore. Concern about it has led some countries, including the UK, to slap travel restrictions on India.
India first reported the B. 1.617 genome to the global database (GISAID) in October.
India’s health ministry flagged the variant in late March, saying it appeared in 15-20 per cent of samples analysed from the worst-hit state Maharashtra. More recently, the figure was 60 per cent.
B. 1.617 has been categorised by the World Health Organisation as a “variant of interest”.
Other variants detected in Brazil, South Africa and the UK have been categorised as “of concern”, because they are more transmissible, virulent or might reduce antibody efficacy.
B. 1.617 has several mutations, including two notable ones (E484Q and L452R), leading to it sometimes being called the “double mutant”.
Rakesh Mishra, director of the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, is one of the scientists currently analysing the B. 1.617 variant.
So far, he says, it has been “better in terms of spreading compared to other variants”.
“Slowly it will become the more common one and it will replace the other variants,” he told AFP.
It is not yet known, however, if India’s current wave is linked to this variant, or if it is being driven by human behaviour or something else.
Health experts have raised “super spreader” concerns over recent huge religious festivals and political rallies with mostly maskless crowds.

Shoppers have begun panic buying in the final hours before Perth plunges into a three-day lockdown.
Concerned shoppers have begun panic buying products before parts of Western Australia are plunged into a three-day coronavirus lockdown.
The Perth and Peel regions will go into lockdown from midnight tonight until midnight on Monday when the long weekend ends.
One of the four reasons people are allowed to leave their homes during the lockdown is to go shopping for essentials like groceries, medicine and necessary supplies.
But that has not stopped many people from panic buying.
In fact, the commotion began before Premier Mark McGowan made the announcement after rumours began to swirl on social media that a lockdown was looming.
There were chaotic scenes as shoppers swarmed supermarkets across Perth, with some running into stores wearing masks and gloves.
Among the items people were loading into their trolleys was toilet paper, rice and pasta.
Police officers were even called in to monitor the situation at some places.

Meanwhile, some people on social media expressed confusion about the panic buying.
“Really don’t understand people panic buying coz shopping gives you a legitimate reason to go out of home during lockdown, right?” one person wrote.
Another person wrote: “The funniest thing about panic buying is the people who are at the shops panic buying complaining about the other panic buyers panic buying.”
The lockdown comes after a 54-year-old Victorian man, who was in quarantine at the Mercure Hotel, unwittingly contracted the virus.
He had tested negative before he was released from quarantine, but on Friday he tested positive upon his return to Melbourne.
The man had been out in the community for five days and visited several places in Perth.
He became the third person to contract the virus on that floor of the hotel.
“I know this three-day short lockdown is very, very difficult but I hope we can keep it to three days only,” Mr McGowan said.
“Give our contact tracers and health teams the time they need to ensure community spread is limited.”
AFL fans will have more reason to cheer on their favourite footy teams from tonight until Sunday. This is why.

https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/netball/super-netball-2021-season-preview/news-story/cc1b9a7fdc8434a77464bd533f5b7c1b
The Super Netball is set for its most competitive season ever, but plans have been thrown into disarray before the first game has even started.
The new Super Netball season has been thrown an eleventh hour COVID curve ball, with Western Australia’s snap lockdown threatening Saturday’s scheduled opener between the West Coast Fever and Melbourne Vixens.
The Fever are in discussions with Netball Australia about the possible impact of the lockdown and Victoria’s designation of Perth as a “red zone”, meaning non-Victorians entering the state are forced into hotel quarantine until a flight home can be organised.
After the pandemic forced the entire competition to be played in a bubble in Queensland last season, teams were set to return to home and away fixtures from next weekend, with many teams playing in front of their home fans for the first time in almost two years.
But the 72-hour lockdown for Perth - where the Fever are based - and the Peel region after a man contracted COVID-19 while staying at a quarantine hotel, has thrown the season-opener in Melbourne into chaos.
A Fever statement said the club was in discussions with Netball Australia “about any impact the lockdown may have on our Round 1 fixture or travel plans”.
“We are working through our training options to minimise any disruption, while also preparing for the possibility that players may be required to train in smaller groups or follow individual performance plans during lockdown.”
The lockdown has thrown this sport into chaos already this weekend, with the NBL and A-League cancelling fixtures, the AFL playing in Perth without fans and surf lifesavers from the West forced to withdraw from the Australian championships.
The Melbourne Vixens are set to unfurl the championship banner at John Cain Arena on Saturday if the grand final rematch is able to proceed and kickstart the new season
But both teams will have to overcome challenges if they are to make the finals again this season.
The Fever were penalised 12 competition points, as well as fined $300,000 ($150,000 suspended) after they breached the league’s salary cap significantly in 2018 and 2019.
The Vixens have problems of their own after losing Diamonds captain Liz Watson to a season-ending foot injury after veteran shooters Caitlin Thwaites and Tegan Philip retired following the grand final.
ON THE ROAD AGAIN
Queensland teams the Firebirds and Sunshine Coast Lightning played every match at home last season but will hit the road again this year, while other teams will welcome a return to their home venues, including the NSW Swifts and GWS Giants, who will finally christen their new home at Ken Rosewall Arena.
Former Diamonds defender Bianca Chatfield said while most teams embraced the Queensland hub and grew closer from time together, players will be relieved to be based in their home states.
“You probably underestimated how much (it affected players),” she said.
“Some really embraced it and it helped the younger sides gel because they spent so much time together but the older players who had family and partners back home, it was really hard for them.”
WEST COAST PENALTY
The travel could be a hindrance to the Fever though, who will have to overcome a heavy travel load as well as their 12-point penalty – or three match wins – if they are to scrape into the top four.
Without the handicap, the Fever are definite top four finishers and are among the title favourites but they cannot afford to start slowly, with any more than two losses having the potential to tip them out of finals contention.
“For them (last year) to not have to do the hours and hours of travel they would usually do and will have to do this year, I think this season will be a real adjustment,” Chatfield said.
“We know travel takes so much out of you, so that will add a whole new dimension to what they have to prepare for.
“Mentally it’s going to be their most challenging year but they could win it, that’s how good they are.”
CAN VIXENS GO BACK-TO-BACK?
Without Watson, Chatfield – herself a Vixens premiership captain – says no, and as much as it pains her, she can’t see them making the top four either.
“Lizzy Watson is one of those heart and soul players and having her off the court will have an impact, definitely,” she said.
“I think it’s a rebuilding phase for the Vixens. They’ve lost their goal attack and wing attack and two-thirds of their attack line will now be new … that’s a lot of pressure to put on (shooter Mwai) Kumwenda’s shoulders to make sure she’s scoring.”
BIG MOVERS
The pick-ups made by the Queensland Firebirds (Gretel Bueta and Kim Ravaillion) and Collingwood Magpies (Ash Brazill and Kelsey Browne) have them poised for a move up the ladder, with the Queenslanders among the title favourites with many pundits.
Both teams have new coaches in Meagan Anderson (Firebirds) and Nicole Richardson (Magpies), who are keen to push their sides back into top-four reckoning.
The NSW Swifts made the playoffs last year before crashing out in the first week of finals but Chatfield has them as premiership favourites given their stability, while she believes the GWS Giants will also force their way back into the four.
The league’s most successful team, the Sunshine Coast Lightning, could struggle after the retirement of midcourt genius Laura Langman, with Chatfield having them outside her top four, while a young Adelaide side could also struggle.
ALL TIMES AEST
ADELAIDE THUNDERBIRDS
Coach: Tania Obst
In: Matilda Garrett (Collingwood), Georgie Horjus (elevated from training partner), Elle McDonald (Vixens), Latanya Wilson (Jamaica/English Superleague)
Out: Sasha Glasgow (Fever), Layla Guscoth (English Superleague), Chelsea Pitman (delisted), Kate Shimmin (Sunshine Coast)
Season 2021: The loss of experienced midcourter Chelsea Pitman leaves a gaping hole in the midcourt and while youngster Maisie Nankivell made huge strides last season, she can’t be left to carry the load on her own.
Verdict: A rebuilding side with plenty of exciting young talent but set for another year out of finals contention.
Round 1: Thunderbirds v Giants, Netball SA Stadium, Adelaide, Sunday, May 2, 3pm
COLLINGWOOD MAGPIES
Coach: Nicole Richardson
In: Kalifa McCollin (Trinidad and Tobago/ANZ Premiership), Ash Brazill (injury), Jacqui Newton (Vixens)
Out: Rob Wright (coach, released), Madi Browne (English Superleague), Matilda Garrett (Thunderbirds), Kelly Altmann (delisted)
Season 2021: The addition of shooter Kalifa McCollin, as well as return from injury of Ash Brazill and Kelsey Browne gives the Magpies great depth on paper but they need to gel quickly and remain injury free to have any chance of turning their wooden spoon season on its head and making an audacious push into the finals.
Verdict: Will charge up the ladder this year but likely to just miss the finals.
Round 1: Magpies v Lightning, John Cain Arena, Melbourne, Saturday, May 1, 7pm
GIANTS NETBALL
Coach: Julie Fitzgerald
In: Sophie Dwyer (elevated from training partner), April Brandley (training partner)
Out: Caitlin Bassett (Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic, ANZ Premiership), Teigan O’Shannassy (Swifts)
Season 2021: Despite the loss of former Diamonds captain Caitlin Bassett the Giants boast one of the most stable lists in the competition given the goal shooter barely made it on court last year. Kiera Austin and Jo Harten have forged a magnificent partnership in the shooting circle and the pair are the best exponents in the league of the two-point super shot, meaning the Giants can never be counted out of games.
Verdict: With the Bassett controversy behind them, will push back into the playoffs
Round 1: Giants v Thunderbirds, Netball SA Stadium, Adelaide, Sunday May 2, 3pm
MELBOURNE VIXENS
Coach: Simone McKinnis
In: Kaylia Stanton (Fever), Allie Smith (elevated from training partner), Ruby Barkmeyer (training partner)
Out: Liz Watson (injury), Caitlin Thwaites (retired), Tegan Philip (retired), Elle McDonald (Thunderbirds)
Season 2021: Despite the retirement of shooters Caitlin Thwaites and Tegan Philip, the Vixens looked to be in the mix to defend their title but the loss of co-captain Liz Watson (foot surgery) for the season is a massive blow to their hopes of going back-to-back, despite their incredible defensive depth.
Verdict: Massive call but will miss the finals with Watson out.
Round 1: Vixens v Fever, John Cain Arena, Melbourne, Saturday May 1, 3pm
NSW SWIFTS
Coach: Briony Akle
In: Tayla Fraser (elevated from training partner)
Out: Sophie Craig (delisted)
Season 2021: With arguably the most stable roster in the league, look for the Swifts to hit the ground running and excel this year back on their home turf. With depth all over the court, something would have to go terribly wrong for them not to be in contention.
Verdict: Definite finals material, will push to repeat 2019 premiership success
Round 1: Swifts v Firebirds, Nissan Arena, Brisbane, Sunday May 2, 1pm
QUEENSLAND FIREBIRDS
Coach: Megan Anderson
In: Kim Ravaillion (Magpies/maternity leave), Gretel Bueta (maternity leave)
Out: Roselee Jencke (coach, released), Mahalia Cassidy (Lightning),
Season 2021: The Firebirds were the big improvers last year after a strong back-end to the season and are unbackable favourites to force their way back into the finals after picking up former Birdie Kim Ravaillion as well as welcoming Diamonds goaler Gretel Bueta back from maternity leave.
Verdict: Top four finishers and it would surprise no one if the Firebirds were in the mix for another title.
Round 1: Firebirds v Swifts, Nissan Arena, Brisbane, Sunday May 2, 1pm
SUNSHINE COAST LIGHTNING
Coach: Kylee Byrne
In: Mahalia Cassidy (Firebirds), Kate Shimmin (Thunderbirds), Maddie Hinchliffe
Out: Laura Langman (retired), Jacqui Russell (retired), Ashlee Unie (injury), Annika Lee-Jones
Season 2021: Is there Life After Langman? The Lightning are the most successful club in the Super Netball era, making the grand final in the first three seasons and winning two titles. After the retirement of the player many regard as the greatest of all time, the Lightning face a new challenge this season.
Verdict: Locked in a battle for final playoff spot with the Fever.
Round 1: Lightning v Magpies, John Cain Arena, Melbourne, Saturday May 1, 7pm
WEST COAST FEVER
Coach: Stacey Marinkovich
Ins: Sunday Aryang (elevated from training partner), Emma Cosh (training partner), Sasha Glasgow (Thunderbirds)
Outs: Kaylia Stanton (Vixens), Ingrid Colyer (injury)
Season 2021: It’s the biggest question of the season. Can the Fever overcome their 12-point penalty to make the finals? If they repeat the poor start of last season, they’ll fail but with their stable combination and some luck on the injury front, they’re a good chance and will be determined to prove the doubters wrong.
Verdict: Locked in a battle with the Lightning for the last spot in the four – overcoming travel will be key.
Round 1: Vixens v Fever, John Cain Arena, Melbourne, Saturday May 1, 3pm

Scientists are examining how mutant forms of COVID-19 might impact unborn babies amid disturbing evidence of the virus’s long-term effects.
Victorian scientists say they are ‘incredibly concerned’ about the long-term defects COVID-19 may cause within the human body as researchers scramble to keep tabs on evolving mutant strains.
Contemporary research has pointed to fatigue development, a loss of smell and taste, and heart, neurological, cognitive and lung complications.
But professor Melissa Little, from the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, said there was little understanding about how the virus wreaked havoc once it entered the body.
She said there was a “great deal of concern” across all medical professions due to the unprecedented nature of the virus.
“We really don’t understand how that’s coming about because we don’t really know what the virus is doing when it gets inside us,” Professor Little said.
“We know the body isn’t fully recovering once the virus is cleared, and that we’ve got an event that is now going to cause lots of long-term problems.
“We’ve had virus epidemics before, but we don’t know enough about exactly what is going on because it’s mutating really quickly.”
Researchers in the state have embarked on groundbreaking research examining new and emerging strains, long-term symptoms and potential links between the disease and unborn children.
The group of scientists will use human stem cells and turn them into three-dimensional models to investigate how the virus operates.
The work will build on the MCRI’s research into the effects of the virus on every major human organ. It’s hoped it will spark new ideas about how to evade any long-term impacts.
Professor Little said the health issues would likely impact all demographics unless research proved otherwise.
“We have to assume that everyone who gets it at this point will have a problem,” she said.
“Everywhere that’s had widespread high levels of COVID-19 are now hospitalising, even young people, and while the risk of death is higher the older you get, they’re seeing epidemic proportions of long-term effects.”
While there have been enough pregnant women with COVID-19 to show no damage inflicted on foetuses, scientists will now look at if it’s the same story for mutating forms.
Professor Little said the research was vital in discovering ways to prevent any serious health issues linked to the virus.
“If we don’t understand exactly what is causing the damage, we can’t begin to either prevent it or treat it,” she said.
“Once we know more about what is actually happening, then we can start to find drugs that can address that problem.”

NSW has had a massive number of COVID-19 cases recorded in hotel quarantine overnight, with 18 new infections detected in 24-hours.
NSW has recorded 18 new infections in hotel quarantine, but no new locally acquired cases, on Friday.
The 18 new cases of COVID-19 were all acquired overseas and reported to 8pm on Thursday. It brings the total number of cases across the state since the start of the pandemic to 5229.
In a statement, NSW Health said investigations were continuing into transmission of the virus between returned travellers who entered Australia on April 3 on the same flight and then stayed in adjacent rooms while in hotel quarantine at the Mercure Hotel on George Street in Sydney’s CBD.
“The investigation has not identified any further cases of transmission to date,” it read.
“The three returned travellers, two of whom are family members, share the same viral sequence for the B1.351 variant of concern, first identified in South Africa.
“They were transferred to the Special Health Accommodation and will remain there until they are no longer infectious.”
Investigations were also continuing into how transmission of COVID-19 occurred between two groups of returned travellers in hotel quarantine at Adina Apartment Hotel at Town Hall in the CBD.
All contacts tested to date have returned negative results.
There were 9986 tests reported to 8pm on Thursday, compared with the previous day’s total of 10,264.
NSW Health administered 3,570 vaccines in the past 24 hours.

The Victorian man who tested positive for COVID-19 was in the community throughout Perth for five days before he caught a flight to Melbourne.
A Victorian man who unwittingly contracted COVID-19 in hotel quarantine was in the community throughout Perth for five days before he caught a flight to Melbourne.
Victoria’s 55-day streak of no locally acquired COVID-19 cases came to end with the man’s diagnosis.
The 54-year-old man, who flew to Melbourne on Wednesday and returned a positive test result on Friday, became the third person to contract the virus at Perth’s Mercure Hotel.
“He was one of two people in immediate adjacent rooms,” West Australian Premier Mark McGowan told reporters on Friday.
“The other person has returned a negative test result and will complete 14 days of hotel quarantine in Perth.”
Mr McGowan said the Victorian man arrived in Perth on April 3 from Shanghai and his room was alongside a family of three from the United Kingdom — two of whom also became sick with the virus.
They caught coronavirus from a couple who had travelled from India and were in an opposite room.
“(The Victorian man) returned a negative result on day 12 in hotel quarantine and was then subsequently released on April 17 before leaving for Melbourne on April 21,” Mr McGowan said.
“We now need to assume he was infectious during this five-day period.”
Mr McGowan said teams had been mobilised for contact tracing.
Among the suburbs the man visited were Kardinya, Northbridge and Leeming. He also visited Kings Park.
He stayed with a family for one night and for the remainder of his time stayed at Saint Catherine’s College at the University of Western Australia.
Victorian Health authorities are working on contacting everyone on the flight to Melbourne.
All passengers are being told to get tested and quarantine.
“Obviously, there are going to be a number of primary close contacts on that flight and that flight was Qantas QF778,” Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said.
“All of those people are being contacted by our contact tracing team and will need to isolate for the full 14 days.”
The man, who was asymptomatic, began isolating immediately after being notified he was a close contact by West Australian authorities.
His household contacts — his partner and two children — are all currently in isolation after being tested and will receive their results in the next day.
“He was picked up at the airport by his spouse and returned directly home to his residential location in the eastern suburbs where he lives with three household contacts – his spouse and two children,” Mr Foley said.
“He went straight to the airport and was contacted as he was coming off the plane as a primary close contact.
“He did all of the right things, got his gear, went straight home, sat in the back seat, put his mask on all the way home and stayed separate from the rest of the members of his family members at home.
“We will be examining the gentleman’s movements, particularly for the airport where he did wear a mask, as he did on the flight, as he did on his journey home having been contacted by public health officials as he arrived at the airport.”
Mr Foley said that the man had requested to go into a Melbourne quarantine hotel as a precaution before his positive test result came back on Friday.
“We have of course immediately accommodated that request,” he said.
Mr Foley said it was an important reminder that the pandemic was not over.
When asked if the government was confident the virus had not spread he answered: “It’s still too early to say”.
“Victorians have been down this path. We know the drill. We will do the right thing to keep this to one case, at the moment,” he said.
Because the man tested positive in Victoria, it will be recorded as a local case in the state despite it being acquired in Western Australia.
The outbreak at the Mercure Hotel in Perth happened after a couple arrived from India on April 10 and the man tested positive on April 13, followed by his wife two days later.
A pregnant mother and her four-year-old daughter, who arrived on April 3 from the United Kingdom along with the girl’s father who previously had the virus, were quarantining in an opposite room when they were diagnosed with the virus on April 16.
Authorities are investigating how it happened, but WA Premier Mark McGowan has conceded the Mercure is “not one of the best” hotels for quarantining and would no longer be used.
The potential exposure period for the floor was from April 10.

Sydneysiders are on alert as nine wharf workers wait to find out if they are infected with coronavirus, with fears the virus has been spreading for up to three weeks.
NSW Health has launched an investigation after the crew of a ship that docked in Sydney later tested positive for COVID-19.
Health officials were left in the dark over the fact at least 15 Port Botany wharfies who boarded the ship could have been infected for three weeks.
Eleven out of 15 Sydney workers had returned negative test results by 11am Friday. More test results are expected to come back throughout the day.
The NSW Health investigation will also seek to determine whether an additional three wharfies had boarded the ship.
The Inge Kosan bulk liquids vessel from Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea docked at Port Botany on March 31 and stayed there for 24 hours.
After the ship sailed into Port Vila in Vanuatu, health authorities there found 12 out of 13 crew members were COVID-19 positive.
NSW Health said in a statement early Friday morning they were alerted to the situation on Wednesday. That means 21 days elapsed between the Sydney visit and the discovery by NSW authorities.
It comes after reports the dead body of a sailor was found on a beach in Port Vila. It was determined he was infected with the coronavirus.
NSW Health said it was media reports about that death that led officials to launch its investigation.
“NSW Health sought information from the National Incident Room to confirm these reports and investigated the movements of the ship to ascertain if it had been in NSW,” the statement read.
“Fifteen workers at Port Botany are confirmed to have boarded the ship to conduct routine port activities before disembarking. No crew members disembarked the ship during its time in Sydney.”
NSW Health said there were COVID-safe procedures in place at the port, and that those workers that had been interviewed confirmed they were wearing personal protective equipment.
The discovery of the body in Port Vila sparked a three-day travel lockdown of Vanuatu’s main island Efate, ABC News reported.

"Today we learned it's going to be compulsory for anyone visiting an aged care facility in Queensland to have had the flu shot," he said. 

"They're not going to force you to take it to live your life, but they might use the same rules they're using for flu jabs on COVID-19 vaccines to visit your elderly relatives.

"And remember, just yesterday, Fair Work Australia said it was okay to sack someone if they don't want to take a vaccine."

The United States’ COVID-19 recovery has passed major milestones this week as Australia struggles to pass even its first phase.
The United States’ COVID-19 recovery has passed major milestones this week as Australia struggles to complete even its first phase.
The hard-hit US met one hopeful milestone with half of its adults now having had their first vaccination, while from Monday all over-18s were eligible to get their shot.
The positive news from America — the world’s worst-hit country — is a major win for President Joe Biden, who overnight confirmed the country had passed 200 million vaccinations on day 92 of his term.
Next week, Mr Biden announced the next phase of his operation in what the White House is dubbing “the ground game” — vaccinating all those over 16.
The jab will be available for the over 16s from next Monday.
“Our objective is to reach everyone — everyone over the age of 16 in America,” Mr Biden said.
“Wherever you live, whatever your circumstances, if you are 16 or older, you are now eligible for a free COVID vaccine shot, and we have the vaccine to deliver.
“To put it simply: If you’ve been waiting for your turn, wait no longer.”
Mr Biden bragged 80 per cent of American seniors — aged 65 and older — have been vaccinated.
Meanwhile, in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced Australians aged between 50-69 will now be able to receive the COVID-19 jab … from May.
Just 1.72 million Australians have been vaccinated so far. ABC analysis this week said it could take up to August 2023 until the entire population is vaccinated.

RELATED: Mystery remains over shipment of doses in Australia
Last month, we fell 85 per cent short of the Prime Minister’s initial own target while according to latest Our World data, Australia has delivered just 6.2 doses per 100 people.
Over 50s who are not already eligible to be vaccinated will now be able to get an AstraZeneca vaccine at respiratory clinics from May 3, and at GPs from May 17.
Yet two months into Australia’s rollout, many aged care homes remain unvaccinated.
The PM announced teenagers as young as 16 will also now be eligible to be vaccinated as early as this year because the preferred vaccine for under 50s – Pfizer – is approved for older teenagers. But that’s unlikely until the end of the year.
Previously, the youngest age you could be vaccinated under Australia’s rollout plan was 18.
Australia has struggled immensely over its COVID-19 vaccine rollout despite low case numbers in comparison to the rest of the world.
Shipment delays from overseas were an initial bump in the road but the late night news earlier this month that Australians under the age of 50 should not receive the AstraZeneca vaccine and instead be offered an alternative where possible threw the plan into disarray.
The process of vaccinating under 50s will not commence until all residential aged care patients are vaccinated.
It was originally expected to be completed by Easter but is now estimated to be finalised by the end of May.
Mr Biden has faced some difficulty, though.
On Wednesday, he urged employers in the country to offer paid leave for their staff to receive the vaccine and any sick leave that may ensue after the fact as figures indicate younger Americans aren’t as keen to receive the vaccine.
“One concern I’ve heard from so many Americans is that they can’t afford to take the time off to get vaccinated or lose a day’s work because they are feeling slightly under the weather after their shot.
“I’m calling on every employer, large and small, in every state, to give employees the time off they need, with pay,” he said.
“No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfil their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated.”
As of today, every American is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. For yourself, your neighbors, and your family â please, get your vaccine. pic.twitter.com/o75JYpGe6r
Elsewhere, Denmark is the only European country to have dropped the AstraZeneca vaccine from its vaccination campaign, and said on Tuesday it would “lend” 55,000 doses to the neighbouring German state of Schleswig-Holstein.
Germany is expecting to open up COVID-19 vaccinations to all adults in June at the latest, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday.
Despite vaccine rollouts in many countries, COVID-19 surges are putting immense pressure on authorities from Germany to Uruguay, with no end in sight for a pandemic that has claimed more than three million lives worldwide.
India has taken over the United States for the record highest daily increase of coronavirus cases, with 314,835 in just one day.
The United States previously held the record — 297,430 new cases in one day — in January, though its tally has since fallen sharply.
Despite the positive outlook, Mr Biden warned Americans the worst might not be over.
“If we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase the progress we’ve already achieved, the sacrifices we’ve made, the lives that been put on hold, the loved ones who’ve been taken from us, the time we’re never going to get back.,” he said.
While America’s top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci praised Australia’s initial response into lockdowns and maintaining the low number of coronavirus cases around the country, he said we could learn something from watching their own vaccine rollout.
“What [Joe Biden] has done, for example, is open up community vaccine centres, get vaccines to the pharmacies, develop mobile units to go out to get the people who are in poorly accessible areas,” Dr Fauci said.
He said President Biden’s aim was to get as many experts into communities and vaccinating.
“Those are retired physicians, military personnel, nurses, medical students,” Dr Fauci said.
“[Mr Biden] made it the very, very top priority. He made equity a very important part of this.”
So far, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said given the “many uncertainties involved” it was no longer possible to set an end-of-year vaccination goal.

Weeks ago this country was claiming the pandemic was nearing its “endgame”. Today, it reached a terrible virus milestone not seen in the world.
There have been warnings for months this nation of 1.4 billion people was a COVID-19 time bomb. And it appears that time bomb is now exploding.
The escalating virus situation in India has been likened to a “tsunami” as the nation breaks a terrible new record for daily infections and the insufficient health care buckles under the weight of it all.
India’s health ministry reported 312,731 new infections in 24 hours on Thursday, the highest daily case count in a single country since the pandemic began more than a year ago. The previous daily record of 300,669 cases was set by the United States in January.
What’s even more frightening is the quickening pace of the virus spread in India, the world’s second largest population.
Just two months ago, India was reporting fewer than 100 deaths from COVID-19 each day. On Thursday, it reported 2104 deaths, and the average daily death toll this week was 1300.

RELATED: Australia limits arrivals from India over escalating outbreak
The country is now well and truly in the league of other worst-hit nations, such as the US and Brazil — today, 40 per cent of all new cases are coming from India, and with 15.6 million Indians infected since the pandemic began, it is now second place to the US for total cases.
The situation has become so dire that the Federal Government said on Thursday it was slashing the number of arrivals from India by a third, a move that will make it difficult for Australians in India to come home, and others to travel there for important events like as weddings and funerals.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the high caseload in India was “not something we could ignore”. New Zealand, the US, the UK and Pakistan have made similar moves to limit arrivals from India.
Meanwhile, in India, cremations and burials are happening around the clock and hospitals are running out of ventilators and oxygen as the rate of daily infections continue to climb.
Ambulances carrying patients are lining up outside hospitals because there are no beds inside, and at the Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai, the lobby has been converted into a makeshift COVID ward.
“The volume is humungous,” Jalil Parkar, a senior pulmonary consultant at the hospital, told CNN. “It’s just like a tsunami.”
Experts have similarly described India’s failing healthcare system in no uncertain terms.
Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi, told CNN “things are out of control”.
“There’s no oxygen. A hospital bed is hard to find. It’s impossible to get a test. You have to wait over a week,” he said.
“And pretty much every system that could break down in the health care system has broken down.”
Krutika Kuppalli, infectious diseases expert at the Medical University of South Carolina, tweeted that “COVID-19 has become a public health crisis in India leading to a collapse of the healthcare system”.

Melbourne medical practitioner Dr Vyom Sharma told The Project on Thursday he had several relatives in India with COVID-19 but insisted they were “the lucky ones”.
“We actually managed to find hospital beds for them, with some difficulty. There are many people who cannot get a bed at all,” he said.
“A lot of people who are in hospital beds, they have discovered that oxygen has run out. So, (it is) just not an exaggeration to say that the health system is collapsing and despite how terrible things are for us and our family, we are one of the lucky ones.”
As resources dwindle and hospitals reach capacity in an already patchy hospital system, mishap has compounded the crisis. On Wednesday, 22 people died in the state of Maharashtra when oxygen leaked from the main taker supplying oxygen to COVID-19 patients. In Maharashtra, the daily demand for oxygen is higher than what the state can produce.
Footage aired on TV has shown people carrying empty oxygen cylinders packing refill facilities in a desperate bid to save their loved ones.
In a piece for the Economic Times, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, the executive chairman of Indian healthcare firm Biocon & Biocon Biologics, blamed complacency for India’s current crisis.
“We never thought a second wave would hit us so hard,” she wrote.
“Complacency led to unanticipated shortages of medicines, medical supplies and hospital beds.”
India’s government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, imposed a brutal lockdown in the early months the pandemic last year but critics have accused it of relaxing measures too much and failing to prepare the nation for a second wave.
Tens of thousands of spectators have filled cricket stadiums and Mr Modi’s party has held a series of large political rallies.
On Monday, millions of pilgrims flocked to the banks of the Ganges River for a massive Hindu ceremony that was allowed to go ahead, despite the escalating infection rate.
“India’s rapid slide into this unprecedented crisis is a direct result of complacency and lack of preparation by the government,” Mr Laxminarayan from the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times.
“As the number of cases dropped significantly in mid-February, the Indian government and various policymakers, cheered on by a pliant, triumphalist media, prematurely declared victory against the pandemic. By early March, senior government ministers were speaking about the endgame of the pandemic in India.”
In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Modi acknowledged the country’s “very big battle” against the virus but urged states to use lockdowns “lockdown as their last option”. Despite this, the capital New Delhi imposed a week-long lockdown to quell the spread.
The vaccine is being rolled out across India with more than 132 million people having received at least one dose, but supplies are dwindling.
In the meantime, desperate people are turning to social media begging for medicine for their sick loved ones as the virus spread continues to rage.
Anil Tiwari from Mumbai, whose father died from COVID-19 in November, made a desperate plea on Twitter for an ICU bed for his mother, 58, who is now sick with the virus.
“I’m crying, running to get ICU bed for my mother,” he tweeted on Monday. “Kindly help to save my mother. I love her more than anything.”

Oxygen cylinders are supplied to a Mumbai hospital and signs outside a vaccination centre read "Covishield out of stock" as India posts a global one-day record of almost 315,000 new Covid infections.
As Poonam Sinha fought for her life, her distraught son found himself fending off black marketeers for coronavirus drugs after the Indian hospital treating her ran out of supplies.
Dire medicine and oxygen shortages as India battles a ferocious new Covid-19 wave mean boom times for profit gougers, although some young volunteers are doing their best to help people on Twitter and Instagram.
He finally located a pharmacist who said the drug could only be found on the black market, and offered to source it for an eye-popping 100,000 rupees ($1,340), over 30 times its usual price and three times the average monthly salary for an Indian white-collar worker.
But the nightmare was only beginning.
"Several hours later, we managed to procure one bed at (a) very high price in a private hospital and moved her there," he told AFP.
Similar heart-rending scenes are unfolding across the country, with desperate people taking to social media to beg for beds, oxygen or medication.
In the northern city of Lucknow, Ahmed Abbas was charged 45,000 rupees for a 46-litre oxygen cylinder, nine times its normal price.
The crisis has added to criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, already under fire for allowing huge religious gatherings and addressing crowded political rallies himself.
"Patients should only be given as much oxygen as they need," Goyal told reporters.
Modi said in an address to the nation on Tuesday night that "all efforts are being made" to boost supplies.
Instead, remdesivir manufacturers told the Indian Express this week that government officials had ordered them to cease production in January because of a fall in infections.
With requests for beds and supplies reaching fever pitch on social media platforms, a network of activists and influencers has sprung into action to help those in trouble.
Content creator Srishti Dixit, 28, told AFP she received a new request for help every 30 seconds, creating a huge backlog.
But the lists she shares with her 684,000 Instagram followers become obsolete almost immediately as beds fill up and pharmacies sell out.
With cases rising at a record pace, India's government is leaving its healthcare workers and anxious citizens to pick up the pieces.
"I just managed to find one supplier but he is charging 20,000 rupees. I have to buy it at any cost", the 34-year-old told AFP in a panicked voice, disconnecting the call.

Arrivals from India will be reduced by a third into Australia and travellers will be forced to take COVID-19 tests before boarding as the country grapples with an escalating COVID-19 outbreak.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed the measure after national cabinet meeting on Thursday, where state and territory leaders discussed how to manage arrivals from high-risk countries.
Australians will also be barred from travelling to high-risk countries and will only be granted exemptions in “very urgent circumstances”, Mr Morrison said.
He confirmed the move would “sadly” impact people travelling for family events like weddings and funerals, but said a growing rate of transmission in hotel quarantine had forced the government’s hand.

“These are difficult decisions we’ve had to make, but the increasing risk we’ve seen from some countries we believe necessitates managing that risk in the best way possible,” he said.
Mr Morrison did not confirm when the arrangements would take effect, but said he expected further confirmation within 24 hours.
“I wouldn’t be suggesting anyone from high risk country be rushing back to Australia, and we will be looking to put this in place very soon,” he said.
India recorded over 300,000 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the worst single-day increase in any country since the pandemic began.
Mr Morrison insisted the government was working to bring Australians home, but the high caseload in India was “not something we could ignore”.
He denied the move was evidence the government lacked confidence in its quarantine system.
“It doesn’t reflect that at all. It reflects that we’re in the middle of a global pandemic that is raging,” he said.
“Australia has been successful throughout this pandemic, working together with the states and territories, to have very effective border arrangements.”
Anyone who had been in a high-risk country within the past 14 days will also have to take a COVID test within 72 hours of leaving their last port of call on the way to Australia.
Mr Morrison said he expected countries other than India to soon be listed as high-risk, pointing to the UK’s ‘Red List’ of travel bans as a template Australia could pursue.
WA Premier Mark McGowan on Wednesday called for a total suspension of arrivals from India over the outbreak, but Mr Morrison claimed he was “fully supportive” of the announcement.

One state is in talks about what to do next as it faces a major hurdle with its hotel facility for COVID-positive patients.
South Australian health authorities are “concerned” with the increasing number of active COVID-19 cases and are now in talks with the federal government about the number of overseas arrivals it can handle.
There are 30 active coronavirus cases in the state, but there remains no community transmission.
The last time the state had this many cases was just before the Parafield cluster, according to SA Health’s chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier.
“This puts me on edge and also members of my staff to make sure we’re still protecting SA so we need to make sure all of our processes in our quarantine stream and medi-hotel are as tight as possible,” she told reporters.
The state recorded nine new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, which Professor Spurrier described as “really high”.
All are overseas arrivals in medi-hotels and include a female in her teens, a male in his 30s, one female and three males in their 40s.
Three of the new cases were classified as historical and were counted towards the state’s tally – which reached 702 – as they had not been diagnosed in the past.
Those old infections were found in a teenage male and female and a woman in her 50s.
With the influx of new cases, Professor Spurrier said authorities were looking “very closely” at its dedicated COVID-19 positive facility at Tom’s Court in Adelaide’s CBD.
“We feel that we’re getting near capacity in terms of our concerns around safety,” she said.
“The first step is to look at the number of people coming into our state, and we’re having conversation with the Premier and the commonwealth about that.”
She said the idea of adjusting the state’s capacity to accommodate overseas arrivals was one option being looked at.
All clinical staff and 88 per cent of medi-hotel staff had been vaccinated, according to the state’s top public health officer.
At Thursday’s press conference, Premier Steven Marshall also announced a full capacity will be allowed at Adelaide Oval.
The Parafield cluster was discovered when an elderly woman presented at the Lyell McEwin Hospital on November 14 last year and tested positive to the virus.
Her case was later linked to a cleaner and a security guard from the Peppers Waymouth Hotel, which was one of SA’s quarantine facilities.
Thirty-three infected people were linked to the cluster, which sparked the state to go into one of its strictest lockdowns – but it only lasted three days.

Health officials are working with Qantas airline crew who may have had contact with the infected Auckland Airport case.
Health authorities are working with Victorian-based aircrew over fears they “may have had contact” with a border worker who tested positive in Auckland.
The Department of Health said officials would now work with Qantas to “identify and assess” aircrew based in Victoria who could have been in contact with the infected case.
“Management of the Victorian aircrew will depend on the outcome of each crew member’s risk assessment,” the department said in a statement on Thursday.
“Some crew will be asked to test and quarantine for 14 days, others will be asked to test and isolate until they get a negative result.”
Victorian health authorities were also contacting 520 passengers who arrived in Victoria from Auckland between April 17-20.
Anyone who travelled to Victoria from Auckland since April 17 should monitor for symptoms, isolate and get tested immediately should symptoms develop, it was advised.
The New Zealand Ministry of Health has published three exposure sites in Auckland.
Anyone who visited these exposure sites during the listed dates and times would need to get tested and isolate until they got a negative result and phone the Victorian Department of Health on 1300 651 160.

A premier has conceded the quarantine hotel at the centre of a COVID-19 transmission is ‘not one of the best’ facilities.
The Perth hotel where a mother and child contracted COVID-19 from a couple in a neighbouring room will now only be used to quarantine low-risk overseas workers because it is “not one of the best”, the Premier has conceded.
The pair, who travelled from the United Kingdom, were diagnosed with COVID-19 after a couple, who arrived from India and were staying in an opposite room at the Mercure Hotel, tested positive for the virus.
TIMELINE OF EVENTS:
Premier Mark McGowan said the potential exposure period for the floor was from April 10.
There were 18 other guests on the same floor who had left after returning a negative result, with two of them who were adjacent to the ill people ordered to quarantine for a further two weeks.
The other 16 people have been directed to immediately self-quarantine and be retested.
Four have so far returned negative test results. There have been no positive cases from staff either.
Since April 10, there have been 13 security guards on shift, 31 various hotel staff, one doctor and two CCTV installers on that floor.
“All of these people will be retested as soon as possible with PCR tests as a precaution, and we have requested they isolate until they return a negative result,” Mr McGowan said.
Authorities have begun an investigation into how the transmission occurred.
“Somehow, between two rooms that had closed doors, there has been transmission,” Mr McGowan said.
“We’re doing everything we can to make sure we test anyone who was on the floor during the relevant period to make sure there was no further transmission into the broader community.
“At this point in time, we have no indication there was further transmission. The relevant people on the floor were required to wear PPE.
“We put in place measures to keep them away from the room in question. We put in place HEPA filters which filter the air.”
The Mercure, which Mr McGowan described as “not one of the best” hotels for quarantining, will no longer be taking on anymore overseas returned travellers.
It will instead be used for low-risk seasonal workers from Tonga and Vanuatu who will pick fruit and vegetables.
“They’re negative pressure rooms and (it) also has windows that can open to the outside,” Mr McGowan said.
“So, therefore, it’s not one of the best hotels, but the report we had said it could be used and that with various measures, for instance HEPA filters, we can continue to use it.”

The Japanese government is poised to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo, Hyogo and Osaka as they struggle against a fourth wave of COVID-19. 

Osaka, Tokyo and eight other prefectures are already under quasi-states of emergency – restricting business and restaurant hours. 

Tokyo’s governor will request an emergency period from April 29 to May 9. 

The request has been accepted by the International Olympic Committee but flagged it was unrelated to the July Games. 

“Tokyo continues to be the best prepared Olympic city ever, and this was underlined by information we got the organising committee and from the coordination commission which are closely cooperating and at full speed to prepare these games which are approaching very, very fast,” the committee’s president Thomas Bach said. 

Tokyo recorded 843 new coronavirus infections yesterday.

At least 22 people are dead after a horror incident that left COVID-19 patients “gasping for breath” and family members frantic.
Authorities are facing outrage after a “shocking incident” in which an oxygen leak led to the deaths of at least 22 COVID-19 patients in a hospital dubbed the “ward of death”.
Devastating stories are emerging after frantic family members attempted to help the seriously ill COVID-19 patients who were reportedly “gasping for breath”.
Local authorities in Nashik, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, say 60 patients were left without oxygen for approximately 30 minutes after their critical supply was interrupted.
At least 11 men and 11 women have died. At the time of the incident, 157 COVID-19 patients were in the hospital, of whom 67 were on ventilator.
“We want strict action against the culprits,” Amol Vyavhare, whose grandmother was one of the patients who died due to a lack of oxygen, told the BBC.
It comes as India has registered record daily cases and deaths with the country struggling to contain outbreaks, forcing residents in Maharashtra and the capital, Delhi, back into lockdown. Overnight it reached 2000 deaths in just 24 hours amid warnings multiple variants of the virus could be circulating.

Latest data shows there had been 295,041 new infections nationwide overnight and 2,023 deaths, India’s highest in the pandemic.
“The corona crisis has plunged the country into a vicious cycle,” Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said in a statement obtained by news.com.au overnight.
“Patients are dying. The news of the accident of oxygen leakage in Nashik Municipal Hospital is shocking.”
Authorities say in the latest incident, an oxygen truck meant to be resupplying the hospital struck a leak and interrupted the flow to ventilators, causing the deaths.
It is unclear who or what caused the incident but India’s Times Now referred to the hospital, about 200 kilometres north of Mumbai, as the “ward of death”.
Meanwhile Indian media have reported similar problems in other hospitals around the country with the issue now hitting the courts in terrifying detail.

On Tuesday, Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted despairingly, pleading for oxygen supplies and warning some hospitals had “just hours” left.
Oxygen tankers arrived just in time at several hospitals late Tuesday but supplies remained tight and reports said deliveries were being held up in neighbouring Haryana state.
The country is said to be at breaking point as hospitals struggle to keep up with demand and patients report waiting days for access to ventilators.
“Normally we would shift some patients to other hospitals … none in the city have spare oxygen,” NDTV quoted one doctor in the state as saying.
“Most of the patients are being sent back because we don’t have enough of this oxygen and remdesivir drug to treat the patients,” said Harish Krishnamachar, associate dean of the Ramaiah Medical College Hospital in Bangalore.
Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen.
The tragedy at a hospital in Nashik because of oxygen tank leakage is heart-wrenching. Anguished by the loss of lives due to it. Condolences to the bereaved families in this sad hour.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the event at the hospital as “heart-wrenching”, but with crematoriums overworked, he called on Indians to step up their efforts to battle the coronavirus so that fresh lockdowns are not necessary.
In his first address since the start of the record-breaking new wave of infections, Mr Modi acknowledged that India’s 1.3 billion people were “once again fighting a big fight”.
Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said a thorough probe would be investigated over the leak.
“It is yet to be ascertained if the leakage from the oxygen tank was caused by negligence or it was the issue of workmanship. The incident will be probed thoroughly,” the minister said.
Victims’ families will also be compensated.
COUNTRY IN CRISIS
There had been hopes that despite its packed cities and poor health care, India had managed to escape largely unscathed from a pandemic that has killed more than three million people around the world.
Recent weeks have seen mass gatherings, including millions attending the Kumbh Mela religious festival, as well as political rallies, lavish weddings and cricket matches against England.
Production of key coronavirus drugs slowed or even halted at some factories and there were delays inviting bids for oxygen generation plants, according to press reports.
Distraught relatives are now being forced to pay exorbitant rates on the black market for medicines and oxygen and WhatsApp groups are white-hot with desperate pleas for help.
“I am scared for my parents and relatives more than I am scared for myself because they are not young anymore and getting admitted into a hospital right now is next to impossible,” one Delhi resident told AFP.
In total India has recorded 15.6 million cases, second only to the US, and more than 180,000 deaths, though it is behind many countries on a per capita basis.

Sky News Host Alan Jones says Australia's coronavirus response has been "disproportionate from day one" and in particular, the treatment of stranded Australians overseas is "a stain on the Morrison Government".

"Unlike those in Canberra, we on this program have not forgotten the 35,000 stranded Australians who are barred from their own country," he said.

"There are grounded planes at airports right around the country. Why can't the Federal Government commission these planes and have all those bureaucrats, who enjoy big salaries, establish a strategy, urgently, to collect our fellow Australians from overseas?

"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had 35,000 Australians register their interest to return to Australia but, still, nothing has been actioned by government. Around 5,000 of those registered are classified as vulnerable.

"The government sets a limit on those allowed into the country. It is currently 6,000 a week. Therefore, when it comes to airlines, they are forced to limit their capacity. This leads to inflated ticket prices - basically extortion - where Australians are priced out and bumped off flights because non-citizens are willing to pay the price of both the travel and the quarantine."

Authorities are investigating how guests who arrived from different countries at different times caught COVID-19 inside hotel quarantine.
West Australian health authorities are scrambling to track the possible spread of COVID-19 at a quarantine hotel in Perth, after two new cases thought to be overseas acquired were confirmed as being contracted inside the hotel.
It comes on the same day NSW health authorities are racing against the clock to trace the possible transmission of the South African strain of COVID-19 after three returned travellers who stayed at a Sydney hotel became infected.
WA Health said on Wednesday night genome sequencing had confirmed two sets of guests, who had rooms opposite each other at Perth’s Mercure Hotel, had the same sequence of virus — even though they arrived in the city from different countries and at different times.
The two infections had been previously reported as being acquired from overseas, but are now listed as hotel quarantine-acquired.

RELATED: Fears mutant virus spread in Sydney hotel
Released hotel quarantine guests who had stayed on the same floor as the two cases have been told they have to isolate again as WA’s acting chief health officer begins an immediate investigation into how the infections happened.
“All other guests who previously stayed on the same (sixth) floor during this time and have been released from the hotel facility tested negative prior to release,” WA Health said in a statement.
“These guests will be retested and directed to self-isolate until cleared by the public health team.
“Guests who were previously in the rooms immediately adjacent will be self-quarantined for 14 days since their last potential exposure and tested.”
A spokeswoman told NCA NewsWire: “We’re just using an abundance of caution”.
WA Health confirmed there have been no positive cases among hotel staff, who are tested daily.
“While similar transmission in hotels in other jurisdictions has not resulted in community transmission, the community must always remain vigilant,” the department added.
“The threat of COVID-19 remains real.”
The development comes as NSW authorities trace the possible transmission of the South African strain at the Mercure Hotel in Sydney, after three returned travellers became infected.
The three travellers returned to Australia on the same flight on April 3 and stayed in adjacent rooms at the Mercure on George St in the Sydney CBD.
Genomic testing has confirmed all three share the same sequence for the B1.351 variant, also known as the South African strain.
“All three people, two of whom are members of the same family, tested negative on their day-two swabs in hotel quarantine, before subsequently testing positive for COVID-19 later during their quarantine periods,” NSW Health said in a statement earlier on Wednesday.
“The two family members stayed in connecting rooms on the 10th floor of the hotel, while the third person was in an adjacent room.
“The family members tested positive on days seven and 10 of their stay, while the person in an adjacent room tested positive on day 12.”
The three travellers will stay in special health accommodation until they are no longer infectious.
NSW authorities are now contacting people who stayed on the same floor as the infected guests between April 7 and 12. They will need to be rested and self-isolate for 14 days from the day they left quarantine.
Hotel staff who worked on that floor are also being rested and are self-isolating.
WA’s only case of community transmission in almost 10 months was in January at the Four Seasons Hotel in the CBD and was caught by a hotel quarantine worker - a security guard - plunging Perth, Peel and the South West regions into a snap five-day lockdown.

A GP explains the side effects Australians are experiencing after the COVID-19 vaccine, and why scientists believe they’re a good thing.
Although the country’s vaccine rollout is not progressing entirely as planned, thousands of Australians continue to receive their COVID vaccines every week.
As a general practitioner administering the AstraZeneca vaccine, I find it strange that my patients all know about the very rare potential complications — such as blood clots — yet often don’t know what side effects they can realistically expect.
Side effects show the vaccine is working
Vaccines work by training our immune system to fight disease.
Many of the side effects we experience after a vaccination (of any sort, not just against COVID-19) are actually because our immune system is doing its thing. If we train for a sport we expect to get sore muscles from training, as well as when we actually compete. Training our immune system is no different.
Possible reactions to vaccines include headache, fever, injection site pain, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue.
Side effects tend to vary slightly between different vaccines, and different people will experience them differently.

RELATED: Vaccine might be needed annually, expert says
Reporting side effects generates information
Because COVID vaccines are so new, Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has requested every reaction suspected to be from one of the jabs be reported. This is happening in a number of ways.
For doctors and nurses administering COVID vaccines, reporting adverse events is mandatory. Of course, many adverse events only occur after a person has left the clinic, so patients are advised to self-report any symptoms or side effects that concern them.
You can report any side effects via the healthcare setting where you had your vaccination (if they have a system for this), via the NPS MedicineWise Adverse Medicine Events line on 1300 134 237, or through the TGA.
Many vaccination centres also send out SMS questionnaires after your vaccine. Innovative software including Vaxtracker and Smartvax is facilitating this.
As a result, we’ve been able to gather a large amount of data about both the Pfizer and the AstraZeneca vaccines since their rollout began in Australia. We no longer need to rely on drug company trial results.
A government-funded research organisation collates the data from these reporting mechanisms, and weekly updates on COVID-19 vaccine safety are freely available.
A snapshot of the current data
More than 200,000 Australians — over two-thirds of people surveyed through these mechanisms so far — have participated in feeding back data.
Some 51.8 per cent of respondents have reported some kind of adverse event, but only 1.2 per cent experienced events serious enough for them to seek medical attention.
The types of events people have reported for both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are similar to those reported in clinical trials, and what we’re seeing in other countries. They include fatigue, headaches, pain/swelling at the injection site, muscle aches, chills, fever and joint pain.
Symptoms appear to be more pronounced after the second dose, which fits with our understanding that they generally indicate a natural immune response rather than anything more sinister (we have a more developed immune response after the second dose). Symptoms usually resolve within three days of vaccination.
How does this compare to other vaccines?
According to Australian data collected on the influenza vaccine in 2020, only 5.5 per cent of people reported any adverse event, with just 0.3 per cent being serious enough to see a doctor about.
You could therefore say the COVID-19 vaccine is causing side effects much more often. It’s possible there’s a biological reason for this — our immune systems may be fighting harder than they do when faced with influenza vaccines.
But there may be a behavioural reason for higher reports too. Perhaps people are being hyper-vigilant about any apparent reaction they’re experiencing to COVID vaccines, possibly inducing what we call a “nocebo” response. This is when negative expectations around a treatment cause patients to report more negative effects than they would have otherwise.
It’s fair to say no vaccine has been as highly scrutinised by the public as the COVID vaccines.
Certain groups may be more likely to get side effects
Are women more likely to have an adverse reaction to a COVID vaccine? While this may seem fairly simple to answer from the data, confounding features make it more complex.
While women do report minor reactions more often, is that partly because they’re more conscientious at reporting? We know women are more likely to seek help for their health in general. The answer to this question continues to be debated.
One group that clearly does have more pronounced reactions is younger people. This is probably because their immune systems mount a stronger response to the vaccine.
Managing side effects
Whichever vaccine you receive, remember side effects are common and expected.
If you’re concerned, the government’s side effect checker asks questions that can help you ascertain whether your reaction is normal, or whether it’s more serious and you should seek medical attention.
It’s fine to take paracetamol or ibuprofen for symptom relief, but taking these pre-emptively is not recommended for COVID-19 vaccines.
Notably, between 4.7 per cent and 23.2 per cent of people are reporting missing work or routine duties for a short period (generally up to one day) following the vaccine. I suggest my patients have their vaccine — especially the second dose — just before a day off work, if possible.
There’s excellent ongoing research happening to define the “real world” side effects from COVID-19 vaccines. Many of us can play a part, and this information can inform us as a community about what to expect.
While serious but rare side effects are making the headlines, the realistic expectation for most of us is that we may feel mildly unwell, and may need to take a day off our regular commitments, esp
ecially after our second dose.

Organisers of a major Aussie music festival have been forced to cancel, issuing an angry statement about “mismanagement” of the virus.
A major Sydney music festival has been cancelled for the second year in a row, with the organisers slamming the government’s “mismanagement of the COVID-19 situation” in an angry statement.
Under the Southern Stars festival co-ordinators announced on Wednesday the concert series, set to feature Cheap Trick, Bush and Stone Temple Pilots around Australia in April and May, would be postponed until 2022 to “protect” patrons, artists and crews during the ongoing pandemic.
“We are as upset about this as you are!” the statement on its website began.
“Given the disappointingly slow rollout of the vaccine by the government, there is no confidence that we can keep all safe and proceed as planned at our festivals this May.
“The continuing mismanagement of the COVID-19 situation at all levels of government has led to numerous inconsistencies and ongoing broken promises by officials that ultimately affect the safety of our patrons, artists and our crews, both domestic and international.
“So much so that the situation presents too much to risk to go forward with the dates as planned at the end of April and into May 2021.”
The organisers said the decision to cancel was not one they took lightly, but public safety was the main motivation.
Under The Southern Stars promoter Andrew McManus urged the community to continue to “believe in us”.
“We get it … how many times can the Australian system force another postponement?” he said.
“So we are making the hard decision to reschedule Under The Southern Stars to the first quarter of 2022 and ask that all our valued supporters hold on to their tickets and in return we will be announcing some truly exciting additions to the line-up and festival circuit.
“We sincerely apologise for the situation and ask once again for our loyal patrons to #keepyourticket and stay tuned.
“Not only for new dates, but we are planning on making Under The Southern Stars bigger and better. It will absolutely be worth the wait.”
The federal Department of Health defended its rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.
“We are working safely and effectively to deliver a large scale COVID-19 Vaccination Program, in conjunction with states and territories and general practice,” a spokesperson said.
“To date more than 1.7 million Australians have been vaccinated.
“Due to the changes to the health advice for the AstraZenca vaccine, the rollout has been recalibrated and we are currently scheduling appointments and expect to see a larger uptake over the coming weeks.
“A vaccination is not viewed as a panacea or a complete substitute for other public health interventions; it is supplementary to other measures.”

A Sunshine Coast woman has turned one of her darkest days into a new lease on life.
This time last year Michelle Price was told her life as she knew it was over.
A journalist for more than two decades, Ms Price was made redundant from Grant Broadcasters at the beginning of the pandemic.

"I had a weird feeling the day before and then I was made redundant lunchtime Monday," she said.
"I hadn't been through that before and I was like 'what do I do with this'.
"In the moment, I remember being in there and ... I just know this is going to be a blessing and I don't know how or what it's going to look like."
She said it was a sad end to a 21-year career.
"When you leave something after two decades of work you kind of assume that you have a send off … there was no thank you for a good job," Ms Price said.
"Redundancy isn't the persons fault it's not that they're being disgraced but it feels like that.
"I was in the middle of writing a story and I was told to pack up my things and told to go."
The Baringa resident said she applied for countless jobs without receiving one interview.
After receiving what she says were signs from the universe she underwent a rebirth to embark on a new career.
The 44-year-old turned to her spiritual side and become a lightworker, medium and reiki and pranic energy practitioner.
"My husband lost his mind at first … he thought we were going to be poor but I just thought I'd give it a go," she said.
"I've gotten so many referrals and word of mouth, I'm booked solid and it's been that way pretty much since the beginning.
"It's almost too good to be true."
She now offers healing and readings to clients all over the world from the U.S. to Latvia.
Ms Price also offers mentorship courses to help others discover and develop their spiritual gifts.
"I try to deliver from the heart, I'm not going to be right for everyone but I always say to people trust your intuition," she said.
Ms Price says she remembers even as a child wanting the ability to heal people.
"When people were sick I always wanted to go up and touch them," she said.
"Also when I touched them I got a lot of information … and have premonitions."
The spiritual healer understands that with believers comes the sceptics, something she says she embraces.
"I love sceptics, I've read for sceptics and I call them out," she said.
"I haven't had anyone walk out not being a believer.
"It's not my job to prove anyone wrong, it's not my job to prove that spiritual stuff is real but I leave that up to spirit."
Despite her paranormal encounters, she says she's never felt any fear.
"I've woken up to the TV blaring and that happens pretty frequently, I've woken up to knocks quite often," Ms Price said.
"There's nothing to be afraid of, I'm probably more afraid of humans to be honest.
"I've been doing a lot of house clearings on the Sunshine Coast, just checking the energy and moving spirits on."
Ms Price said her new-found career has completely changed her life with so many incredible stories she's encountered along the way.
"I have to be really careful sometimes because some of the things that come through are really random," she said.
"Sometimes it's infidelity and I have to be really sensitive.
"I had a lady once where I had to bring that up, and she said 'yeah my mum cheated on my dad and my dad cheated on my mum'."
Ms Price says she can't explain how amazing the connection is.
"I read for a woman and it was the anniversary of his death," she said.
"I didn't know this but the woman was saying in her head 'I want Michelle to talk about diamonds, if you're really here'.
"I then began seeing this wallpaper covered in diamonds rolling down the wall.
"She just broke down … she said I can't believe it, he's here."

Scott Morrison has denied leaving the states to do the heavy lifting with COVID-19 vaccines after Victoria announced a national first.
Scott Morrison insists Victoria’s plan to make cutting-edge COVID-19  vaccines was “not done in place” of the federal government’s effort as he dismissed claims  the states were forced to act.
Victoria on Wednesday announced it would become the first state in Australia to develop mRNA vaccine manufacturing, making previously hard-to-access jabs more attainable locally in a year.
The technology to manufacture the vaccines onshore will take at least 12 months to develop, with Deputy Premier James Merlino announcing the Victorian government would provide $50m towards the critical project.
The Prime Minister welcomed the announcement, saying the pandemic had accelerated the development of mRNA technology which “a year ago ... were a theory largely”.
But he rejected claims the states had been forced to take the reins with mRNA technology after inaction from the federal government.
“That is not done in place of the Commonwealth,” he told reporters.
“Certainly the Commonwealth will be seeking to support what we could do in this area as well.
“mRNA vaccines will be important for vaccine development into the future and Australia will be a part of that. My government will be a part of that. State governments will be a part of that.”
The comments come after federal Labor health spokesman Mark Butler claimed Victoria had been forced to fill a void left by federal government inaction.
“Time and time again in this pandemic, state governments have had to step in where Scott Morrison has been too slow to act,” he said.
Mr Butler said experts had for months been calling for the capacity to produce mRNA vaccines, which would be vital in years to come.
“We know the booster shots that are likely to be necessary to extend immunity, but also to deal with the variants that are that are racing around the world, are going to depend very heavily on mRNA vaccines,” he said.
Victoria’s announcement means the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which both use mRNA technology, could be developed in Australia.
Australia currently only has the ability to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine domestically, with 50 million doses to be produced by CSL in Melbourne.
Mr Morrison said the federal government had moved to ensure Australia’s vaccine sovereignty and Victoria’s announcement was another step towards that goal.
“We are one of a handful of countries that can (produce its own COVID-19 vaccine). So I think ... as a government, we have already demonstrated our capacity to move,” he said.
But following reports of a rare blood clotting disorder linked to AstraZeneca, the nation’s vaccine advisory group recommended people under the age of 50 get a different dose.
Mr Merlino said the development of the mRNA vaccine was a national priority and would lead to rapid speed in development.
“Twelve months ago would’ve been the best time to develop this, but the next best time is right now ... we need to do this,” he said.
“We have seen the challenges of global supply, we know the benefits of onshore manufacturing and of this technology.”
The location is yet to be identified but will be somewhere in Melbourne.
The development of the mRNA technology will be a first for the southern hemisphere, and will be a collaborative project between Melbourne University, Monash University and the Doherty Institute.
It is expected to lead to a lower cost, speedier development, higher efficacy and safer administration of the vaccines.
It’s also hoped it will help Australia and the wider region address the challenges of global supply insecurity, which has posed a significant challenge in the rollout of the Commonwealth’s vaccine program.
Mr Merlino said the future was unpredictable and yearly booster shots could be needed as the disease transformed and developed.
“It will take at least 12 months - it does take time to get those first batches,” he said.
“But the benefits of this technology go well beyond the pandemic and into cancer treatments and the treatments of rare diseases.”
The state will be working with the federal government to deliver the technology.

A coronavirus-infected airport staffer who cleaned planes from high-risk countries also worked on aircraft bound for Australia.
There are now fears the staffer may have passed the infection on just two days after the trans-Tasman bubble opened.
New Zealand’s director of public health Caroline McElnay said authorities believed the case was linked to a returning passenger from Ethiopia.
“The person who has become infected works at cleaning planes from international flights,” she told reporters on Wednesday.

“This includes countries that are deemed red zone where COVID-19 is widespread, but also includes having cleaned green zone planes flying back to Australia on Monday.”
Dr McElnay noted it was the same protocol used in Australia.
“The person wore full PPE while cleaning and we have been in touch with Australian authorities to notify them about this case,” she said.
“Our assessment is that there is no additional risk to any passengers who travelled on those flights cleaned by the infected person.”
The worker has received both doses of the COVID-19 jab, which means the risk to the community is low.

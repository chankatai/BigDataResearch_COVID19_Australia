Or does it look like their home is messier than normal? If there’s anything that’s cause for concern, start a Notes section on your phone and monitor it.', '2. Speak with your siblings: If you’re lucky enough to have family support on the ground, then speak with them about what you’re thinking. See if they agree (or have other things to add) and remind them that although you live overseas, you want to be as involved as you can be.', '3. The talk: It may be time for you and your siblings to talk with your parents about how they really are. Arrange a time that works for all time zones, and tell mum and dad why you want the chat. The overriding sentiment to communicate is that you’re here for them and looking for solutions. Use conversation starters and try to let them lead the chat. What you want is to all raise the noted areas of concern, see if they agree (or if they have other pressing worries) and then collectively agree on next steps.', '4. Divide and conquer: While siblings may be able to help your parents on the ground, you can still research and send useful products, look into local resources and find external help. Ask what would make life easier for them — can you sort food delivery or agree a time to consistently ring your parents so some of the pressure is taken off your siblings? You could even do things for a brother or sister if they have to suddenly spend more time helping mum and dad.', '5. Plan ahead: Conversations about the future are confronting, but important to have. If the worst happens, think about what you would need to sort out. From their utility providers to all their digital passwords, knowing this information will make your life easier down the track. Start a spreadsheet in Google Drive — you can easily share it with the family.', '6. Help them get power of attorney: This legal document is one of the most important things anyone can set up that may never be used but is there if someone can’t make their own decisions (e.g. with dementia). If your parent becomes unwell, you can’t just access their bank accounts to pay for their care, or make health-related decisions for them. Only their attorney can.

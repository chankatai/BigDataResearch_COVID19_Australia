Doctors are warning of a new phenomenon of a coronavirus co-infection, with patients catching two COVID-19 strains at once, which they fear it could lead to even more variants evolving.
Patients could catch two COVID-19 strains at once, scientists say, after reports of dual infection from Brazil.
And it could lead to even more new variants evolving, with abilities to dodge vaccines and spread easier.
Amid growing concern of new variants popping up globally, doctors said they were the first to describe the phenomenon of a coronavirus coinfection.
Two people in their 30s tested positive for two Brazilian strains known as P.1 and P.2.
The patients were infected in late November with the P.2 variant of coronavirus identified in Rio.
They simultaneously tested positive for the P.1 variant of the virus which evolved separately in Manaus, which was confirmed with laboratory tests.
The patients’ symptoms were reportedly mild, with a dry cough in one case, and coughing, sore throat and headache in the second. They did not need hospital care.

Dr Fernando Spilki, a virologist at Feevale University in Rio Grande do Sul state and lead researchers, said dual infection was only likely to happen when different viruses were circulating in high numbers.
Since November, Brazil has been fighting a steep second wave of infections, routinely recording over 1000 deaths per day in 2021.
Hospitals are at capacity in the country amid a resurgence of cases caused by new strains of the virus.
The case studies reported by Dr Spilki and colleagues raise concerns among scientists that coinfection could speed up the development of new mutations, and therefore new variants of the coronavirus.
“These co-infections can generate combinations and generate new variants even more quickly than has been happening,” Dr Spilki said, according to Reuters.
“It would be another evolutionary pathway for the virus.”
RELATED:  Fears as South African strain spreads
One of the ways mutations evolve is by coinfection of the same cell.
This is thought to be one way the new UK strain of coronavirus picked up a more worrisome mutation characteristic of the South African and Brazil variants.
But scientists admitted this was a “rare” way for coronaviruses to gain mutations.
Speaking on the back of the research - which has not been peer-reviewed - scientists said it was already the case that people get infected with two strains of a virus at once.
“It is perfectly possible for a child attending a primary school to get infected with one variant of Covid-19, and an older sibling to attend secondary school and get infected with a different Covid-19 variant - and for both children to bring their viruses home to infect each other - and their parents with both variants,” Dr Julian Tang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, told MailOnline.
Professor Keith Neal, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Nottingham, said if there was a lot of transmission “you can pick up two different viruses around the same time”.
But when one strain is predominant, that is unlikely.
In the UK, the Kent variant has quickly become the most prevalent strain, however, there are others still in circulation.
It comes as ministers race to avoid another new variant from South Africa wreaking havoc, after more than 100 cases have been identified in the UK since December, at least 11 of them with no travel links to South Africa.
The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has vowed to “come down hard” on the variant with the introduction of a mass testing scheme.
A door-to-door testing blitz on up to 350,000 people was launched this week in areas where the South African strain is feared to be transmitting within the community.
Meanwhile, the UK‘s Kent COVID strain has acquired a mutation similar to the South African variant, and could resist jabs, official reports revealed.
Public Health England have detected 11 cases in Bristol where the Kent variant has gained the E484K mutation, which helps the virus to “escape” immune response.
A cluster of 32 cases in Liverpool also have the same mutation but relate to the original strain of coronavirus that has been around since the start of the pandemic, from Wuhan.
Mr Hancock said yesterday the new variants pose “renewed challenges” as the UK makes great strides in its vaccination rollout.
Dr Tang said the mutation was a “worrying development, though not entirely unexpected”.
Regarding the E484K mutation seen in the Kent variant, Dr Jonathan Stoye, from the Francis Crick Institute, said the PHE report suggests the UK variant is now independently acquiring the E484K change.
“From a virological standpoint, appearance of new variants by mutation during replication cannot be considered surprising,” he added.
“Whether this change will provide significant growth advantages for the novel virus causing it to predominate remains to be seen.”
New variants threaten resistance to vaccines, and could also increase the risk of reinfection in people who have previously recovered from Covid.
Experts in Brazil reported in January that an unnamed 45-year-old nurse came down with the P.1 variant in October - five months after she recovered from an older strain of Covid-19.
Her symptoms were worse the second time she caught the virus, as she developed breathing difficulties, shortness of breath, muscle pains and insomnia.
The P.1 variant, which has the E484K mutation, has not yet been detected in the UK.
P.2 has been detected in the UK, but experts say it is no cause for concern.
Researchers from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a science institute in Rio de Janeiro, said that “viral evolutions may favour reinfections”.
Public health experts believe current vaccines will still be effective against new strains, although at a lower level, and are good at preventing severe disease.

Daniel Andrews is back from leave and has a strategy he wants implemented to stop a contagious strain of coronavirus entering the community.
Daniel Andrews has returned from leave ahead of a crucial national cabinet meeting where he says he will push for Australian jurisdictions to join Victoria in adopting certain hotel quarantine measures.
The Victorian Premier said he wants to push mandatory COVID-19 testing of flight crew, treating them as if they are “no different” to returned travellers, and pre-flight testing at Friday’s meeting.
He said it’s part of a bigger plan to keep the “hyper-infectious” UK strain of the coronavirus out of the wider community.
“I‘m back to make sure that those things that we have led on become part of our national coronavirus response,” he told reporters on Thursday morning.
“You’ve heard me say many times that so many Parliaments of the world are on fire when it comes to this virus and now with these new strains that are much more infectious than that which we’ve been dealing with … every person who gets it is giving it to four other people … there will be no pulling it up.
“That’s why the measures we’ve pushed are so important. It’d be my expectation they will be agreed to at national cabinet tomorrow.”
Mr Andrews warned there needed to be a “comprehensive strategy” to prevent the deadly new strains of coronavirus leaking out of hotel quarantine.
“You will never make this risk free, but there has to be a strategy that deals with the multiple risk points with multiple policy solutions,” he said.
“There needs to be something at every point to ensure, as best we can, that this super-infectious strain of this virus does not get into the Victorian community and, therefore, into the Australian community.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the virtual meeting would consider a set of proposals about international arrivals and quarantine from the expert medical panel.
Leaders will also discuss the need for a nationally consistent approach to public health orders about the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has previously accused the government of dragging its feet on calling the meeting, which was originally scheduled for February.
He told 2GB that national cabinet needed an overhaul because it lacked consistency and co-ordination.
Victoria recorded no new cases on Thursday despite the emergence of a mystery case on Wednesday.
The Premier said this case had been linked back to the northern beaches outbreak in greater Sydney, but health authorities were still working out its passage into Victoria.
Department of Health and Human Services testing commander Jeroen Weimar added another exposure site at Chadstone to the state’s virus hot spot list, warning anyone who visited Zara at the precinct from 6am-1.30pm on Boxing Day to get a COVID-19 test.

A 41-year-old Republican Representative-elect has died from complications related to COVID-19, days before he was supposed to take office.
Louisiana Representative-elect Luke Letlow died on Tuesday night from complications related to the coronavirus. He was 41.
A family friend confirmed to the  Monroe News-Star that Mr Letlow died in the intensive care unit at Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport, where he had been hospitalised with COVID-19 since December 23.
“The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” his spokesman said in a statement.
The newly-elected Republican announced on December 18 that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was first quarantining at home.
RELATED:  Fauci says worst is yet to come for US cases
He was hospitalised the next day and eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mr Letlow, a married dad of two from rural Start, Louisiana, won the Pelican State’s 5th District seat in a December 5 run-off race and was set to take office on Sunday.
Congressman-elect Letlow felt a calling from a young age to serve the people of his home state, working behind the scenes for former Governor Bobby Jindal and serving as chief of staff to Congressman Ralph Abraham, who he was recently elected to succeed. #lagov
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards offered his condolences to Mr Letlow’s family and said he had ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on the day of the Congressman-elect’s funeral, which will be announced at a later date.

“COVID-19 has taken Congressman-elect Letlow from us far too soon. I am heartbroken that he will not be able to serve our people as a US Representative, but I am even more devastated for his loving family,” Mr Edwards said in a statement.
In a Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Letlow’s wife Julia had thanked the public for their “continued prayers and well wishes” as her husband continued to battle the illness.
“We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for the outpouring of support we have received and feel truly blessed to be touched by the prayers of so many,” she wrote.

“This case will be reported in tomorrow’s numbers and is the sixth case linked to the Hoxton Park cluster,” NSW Health said in a statement on Sunday.
“This case is the second child to have likely acquired their infection at Flip Out Prestons Indoor Trampoline Park, Unit B/238 Hoxton Park Road, Prestons, while there at the same time as a positive case, also a child, on Sunday 25 October.”
The Prestons drive-through COVID-19 clinic (Ash Road Sporting Complex, Prestons NSW 2170) is open seven days a week, 8am – 6.30pm.
Anyone who attended Flip Out Prestons Indoor Trampoline Park, Unit B/238 Hoxton Park Road, Prestons from 11am to 2pm on Sunday 25 October is now considered a close contact and must get tested immediately and isolate for a full 14 days from exposure regardless of the result.
NSW Health has reiterated an alert for anyone, including staff and patrons, who were at Jasmins1 Lebanese Restaurant, 375 Macquarie St, Liverpool on Sunday, October 25 to “immediately come forward for testing”.
“A case, first reported on 28 October, attended the restaurant while infectious and although contact tracing is well underway, details of some people who also attended during this time were not available,” the health department said.
“Anyone at the restaurant for at least an hour at this time is considered a close contact and must get tested immediately and isolate for a full 14 days from exposure regardless of the result.
NSW Health is again calling for anyone, including staff and patrons, at Jasmins1 Lebanese Restaurant, 375 Macquarie Street, Liverpool, on Sunday 25 October 2020, from 2pm to 3.30pm to immediately come forward for testing.

Two Sydney schools will be closed for deep cleaning after three students tested positive for COVID-19, sending hundreds of staff and students into isolation.
Contact tracing is under way after two students from a school in Sydney’s southwest and another at a school in western Sydney tested positive for COVID-19, sending hundreds of staff and students into isolation.
Greenway Park Public School in Carnes Hill, west of Casula, is closed for deep cleaning. The before-and-after-school care program has been cancelled.
Bonnyrigg High School, in Sydney’s west, has also closed after a student returned a positive test.
“The school will be non-operational tomorrow for the on-site attendance of staff and students to allow time for the school to complete the contact tracing process and have the school cleaned,” the school said in a statement posted to Facebook.
NSW Education said both schools would be “thoroughly cleaned” and it would assist the health department with the contact tracing process.
“All staff and students are asked to self-isolate while contact tracing occurs,” the department said.
Advice on when students can return to face-to-face learning is expected later on Tuesday.
NSW reported 13 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, four of which were returned travellers from overseas or Victoria.
Others were linked to clusters, and one case had no known source.

Punters have continued to keep on gambling at Sydney’s Star Casino, despite a confirmed coronavirus case earlier in the day.
Punters have continued to keep on gambling at Sydney’s Star Casino, despite a confirmed coronavirus case earlier in the day.
The Pyrmont haunt remains open to the general public with gamblers seemingly unfazed the venue could be the latest COVID-19 cluster hotspot.
The Star Sydney confirmed a male patron who visited the complex on Saturday, July 4, tested positive for COVID-19.
In a statement lodged to the Australian Stock Exchange, the group said it had been informed by New South Wales health authorities a man who visted the complex on the night had returned a positive reading for the infectious disease.
The Star noted the patron had been at the casino between about 7.30pm and 10.30pm.
“The Star is working closely with NSW Health to respond to this information, including the conduct of contact tracing which includes staff members,” the company said.
In a separate statement, the Canterbury League Club in Sydney’s southwest also confirmed someone who visited the venue on July 4 had tested positive for COVID-19.
The patron had visited the club between 11pm and 2am on the same Saturday night.
The club said it was contacting staff and patrons who were at the venue.
NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said authorities were uncertain whether the man was infectious while he visited the Star because he was not displaying symptoms.
“It is sometimes unclear, particularly when people have very mild disease at the exact time of onset or infectiousness,” Dr Chant said.
“We also advised that he was largely maintained within his group and really did not interact with anyone else.”
The casino reopened on June 1 and was operating on a restricted timetable.
Star Entertainment shares listed on the ASX took a nosedive after the announcement, amid fears a lockdown of the surrounding suburb of Pyrmont could be on the horizon.
As of 1.45pm on Monday, Star Entertainment shares were flat at $2.70 per share, losing its 7.4 per cent rally earlier in the day.
On July 1, the Star was able to host up to 5000 patrons at a time within the complex.
As of 2pm on Monday, the Star remained open.
An NCA NewsWire employee observed there was no active cleaning occurring on the gaming floor, however sections were closed off to the public.
The news comes as NSW recorded 14 new cases of coronavirus on Monday.
Four were returned travellers; two were NSW residents who acquired the infection in Victoria. Both have been in self-isolation since returning and have no close contacts.
The other eight cases include five who attended the Crossroads Hotel in Casula, and three are contacts of cases who were at the hotel.
Meanwhile, a second hotel in Sydney’s southwest has been forced to close after a patron tested positive for COVID-19.
NSW Health confirmed The Picton Hotel had now closed for deep cleaning after a person attended the pub on three separate occasions to play the pokies while infectious.
It is understood the infectious person sat in the gaming room on July 4, 9 and 10, according to the health department.
A fitness centre nearby has also closed for a deep clean after a confirmed case, linked to The Crossroads Hotel, attended the gym.
Planet Fitness in Casula, just a kilometre away from The Crossroads Hotel, took to Facebook to confirm the news and urged anyone who may have attended the gym — particularly between 9am and 11am on Thursday and 4pm and 6pm on Friday — to get tested.
“The member has not been at the club since Friday 10 July, and is in quarantine,” the gym’s letter to members said.
“We are taking the precautionary measures of closing this location … and to ensure the uncompromised safety of our members.”

Australian health authorities say they’ll know soon whether massive rallies in Australian cities created clusters of coronavirus cases.
Health authorities are waiting to see if Saturday’s Black Lives Matter protests across the nation have undermined the containment of COVID-19 in Australia.
Just a handful of new cases were reported on the weekend, but it will be nearly a fortnight before it is known if there are any spikes in cases as a result of the rallies where social distancing was almost impossible.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says while he can understand why people joined the protests, health authorities now have to be extra alert.
“We don’t know if anyone in those mass gatherings were infected or infectious, and so it is a wait-and-see approach,” Professor Kelly told reporters in Canberra on Sunday.
“I was encouraged to see the face masks yesterday ... those people we’re doing the right thing.”
Victorian Deputy Chief Health Officer Annaliese van Diemen agreed the Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne increased the risk for cases.
“In terms of potential outbreaks related to the protest, it really will be at least a week and probably closer to two weeks before we have an idea of whether there’s been any transmissions or outbreaks related to that,” Dr van Diemen said.
Twenty thousand people also marched in Sydney and crowds rallied in Brisbane, Adelaide and some regional cities and towns despite public health warnings.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt hopes the rallies that clearly broke COVID-19 social distancing rules will not lead to a new wave of infections.
“If there is someone who is infectious in the midst of a crowd like that, that can have a catastrophic impact,” Mr Hunt told ABC radio.
The Australian protests in solidarity with African American George Floyd who died while being arrested in Minneapolis, also a showed support for the Aboriginal community to highlight high levels of indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody.
Labor has attacked Finance Minister Mathias Cormann for labelling the protesters in Australia as being “reckless” and “self-indulgent” during a pandemic.
Opposition indigenous Australians spokeswoman Linda Burney described Senator Cormann’s comments as “tone deaf” and “politically expedient” Australia has now had around 7260 confirmed COVID-19 cases while the death toll remains at 102.
Worldwide, there have been at least 6,897,225 cases and nearly 400,000 deaths.
The ACT recorded its first case of COVID-19 in over a month, a male aged in his 40s, who recently returned from overseas.
But ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman is confident there has been no risk to the broader ACT community.
“The case is, however, a good reminder of the ongoing pandemic and the need for our community to continue to observe physical distancing and hygiene measures, and for people to stay home if they are unwell,” Dr Coleman said in the statement.
There were also four new cases of coronavirus in Victoria.
One is a household contact linked to an outbreak last month at a McDonald’s restaurant in Fawkner and the three others are returned travellers in hotel quarantine.
But Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland all returned blank sheets, as did NSW for a second day in a row.
But Queensland is undertaking contact tracing after a Melbourne man who arrived to pick strawberries in Bundaberg was confirmed on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Morrison government is extending some of the measures in its $1.2 billion support package for the aviation sector to ensure the industry is sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We have kept the aviation sector going by funding minimum networks to get essential personnel and critical supplies to where they may be needed,” Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said in a statement.

Long lines of cars were seen at a drive-through COVID-19 testing clinic at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on May 27, a day after students with coronavirus attended classes at two local schools. Waverley College and Moriah College in Sydney’s east were shut on May 26 after it was confirmed students had tested positive for coronavirus, just one day after pupils made a full-time return to campuses across the eastern states. This video shows a long line of cars at the testing site the day after the two schools were closed. “Yesterday there was definitely an influx of cars shortly after Waverley College was shut down, and then the line grew after Moriah did the same. But this morning I’m in shock. We haven’t seen a line like this since the pandemic peak. The line is just getting bigger and bigger.

It’s one of the great mysteries of the coronavirus pandemic: why haven’t there been outbreaks at supermarkets or hairdressers?
It’s one of the great mysteries of Australia’s COVID-19 experiment: despite fears supermarkets and hairdressers could prove high risk for the spread of the virus, there have been no major outbreaks detected.
When pubs, clubs, and restaurants were shut down seven weeks ago, the fact hairdressers were allowed to stay open seemed to go against the grain of the prevailing wisdom.
Social distancing was impossible and hairdressers who remained open were often wearing little in the way of personal protective equipment and gloves.
When the Prime Minister first allowed hairdressing salons to continue trading, he stipulated a 30-minute rule, which was quickly lampooned and extended.
Some hairdressing salons begged to be able to close fearing the risk to their staff and clients was too great.
But in the weeks that followed, many hairdressers have remained open with seemingly little in the way of outbreaks. In Denmark, hairdressing salons were recently reopened with little sign it is sparking a new increase in cases.

Supermarkets have also stayed open without signs they are spreading the virus, despite the fact many workers are not wearing masks or gloves.
Why is this so?
Australia’s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly admits it’s been a learning curve. But the early evidence suggests it’s close, prolonged contact that is the key.
That’s most likely to occur in households and aged care facilities which is where the greatest spread of the virus is occurring.
It’s also likely to occur at weddings and parties where large gatherings occur for extended periods.
“We learn things every day,’’ Professor Kelly said.
“We know that this is an infectious disease, that is quite clear. It is a virus, it does spread from person-to-person and we know it is quite infectious.
“We also know that this infection is more likely to spread in households. So it is between people living in the same house, for example, family members.
“And again from adult to adult rather than from child to adult. In terms of households, it is due to the close and prolonged proximity with someone that is infectious with others that are susceptible to the virus. So that household infectiousness is the most prominent one around the world.”
That raises natural fears about reopening schools given large groups of children will be gathering in campuses across Australia.
But Professor Kelly is adamant the medical advice on this risk is clear.
“It is absolutely clear now that it is less infectious in children. Children are less likely to spread the virus between each other, or even from children to adults,’’ he said.
“They are also less likely to be infected and they are less likely to have a severe infection and very, very rarely does that end up in intensive care and the more severe end of the spectrum. So children, in general, are not as much of an issue in terms of this virus.”
Doctors are also learning more about when you are most likely to pass on the virus to friends, relatives and work colleagues.
“Most of that infectiousness happens in the first five days of people being sick,’’ he said.
“So for — mostly the infection is when someone is quite obviously sick, they know they are sick and they are transmitting it from person to person. Much less so before they get sick. So this is now quite clear,” he said.
Staying outdoors is also a lot safer than staying indoors, raising some questions about the original prohibitions on reading a book in Sydney’s parks.
“There has been one well-documented case of a stadium, a Champions League soccer match in northern Italy when Italy was right in the middle of their epidemic where there was an outbreak that came in that setting,’’ he said.
“But other than that, very little in relation to outdoors — people outdoors infecting each other.
“So these are now strengthening our resolve in terms of our general principles as to how we are going to look at reopening society, reopening the economy in a COVID-safe way.”
But infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collignon cautioned we should not regard hairdressing salons, schools, or supermarkets as magic spaces where transmission should not occur.

Supermarkets, for example, were linked to the spread of COVID in Italy and the United States.
The most likely reason it has not occurred here is simply due to the low rates of community transmission in Australia. That is, cases where the infected person has no known contact with another COVID sufferer.
If a second or third outbreak were to occur in Australia, there’s no reason to believe infections could not occur in supermarkets and hairdressing salons.
“Anybody can get it from anybody. But it’s proportionate with the amount of time you spend with someone,’’ Professor Collignon said.
“Hairdressers, we’ve had them open and they are obviously closer than 1.5 metres. But it’s also a function of the fact we have very low rates of community transmissions.
“If you take out the cruise ships, the people returning from overseas and their close contacts, there’s less than 10 per cent of cases in Australia that are community transmissions.
“If we were like New York, I would be closing the hairdressing salons down.”

Star singer Rita Ora has been locked up in a Sydney hotel room after previously breaking COVID-19 rules in London at an A-lister party.
Superstar Rita Ora has entered hotel quarantine in Sydney after previously breaking COVID-19 rules at a star-studded London party.
Ora, 30, is in Australia to shoot the upcoming season of The  Voice, where she’ll be a coach guiding wannabe pop stars on how to achieve their singing goals.
The Brit was escorted from Sydney Airport to a hotel quarantine facility, unlike some other foreign A-listers who have been able to quarantine in homes, The Sun reported.
“There was nothing she could do to avoid having to properly quarantine,” a source told the newspaper.
Ora previously caused a scandal in the UK when it was exposed she had hosted a birthday party at a Notting Hill venue that broke coronavirus restrictions.
According to UK media reports, the singer paid the equivalent of $9000 to rent out the Casa Cruz restaurant, where the CCTVs were turned off for the night. A recent licensing hearing by the local council heard the camera hard drives were wiped afterwards.
Police say CCTV hard drives were reformatted two days later, with no footage available from the previous month.
The star has since apologised for the party, as details emerged in a licence review for Casa Cruz in London’s Notting Hill due to be heard today.
In a statement to police on December 1, former Casa Cruz boss Scottie Bhattarai said he was contacted by a representative of Rita on his personal mobile at 5.30pm.
He said the person wanted somewhere for “drinks and nibbles” and he was offered $9000.
Most staff were on furlough so Mr Bhattarai went to the venue to “facilitate”, admitting he was “greedy”.
He said the plan was to have around seven guests but by 9pm almost 20 had turned up.
They reportedly included model Cara Delevingne, her sister Poppy and Towie’s Vas Morgan.
Police were called just before midnight. Photos later emerged of Rita and friends leaving – as revealed by The Sun.
Making matters worse, Ora had arrived from Egypt just a week before the November 28 party.
That overseas trip should have required her to self-isolate for two weeks.
The singer has apologised for the party. The Seven Network, which will air the new season of The Voice, has been contacted for comment.

ROUTINE testing has uncovered further traces of COVID-19 at another sewerage facility based in the Ipswich area.
Queensland Health confirmed on Thursday more viral fragments had been detected in wastewater at a Bundamba site.
It comes less than 24 hours after a similar discovery at a nearby Goodna facility was revealed.
The Goodna site was among several locations across the state to return positive results.

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said continued positive results were concerning due to the growing New South Wales cluster and new Victorian cases.
“Both of these treatment plants collect wastewater from large urban populations,” she said.
“It is very important that anyone in the Bundamba and Merrimac catchments who has COVID-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, comes forward for testing,” she said.
The samples were collected at Bundamba on December 28.

Samples taken at the Gold Coast’s Merrimac site on December 24 also returned positive.
Dr Young said the recent finds indicated either a recovered case or undetected active case within the area.
“If there are active cases in the area, it is important that we detect them early to prevent further transmission,” she said.
“With the New South Wales cluster growing and new cases in Victoria, it’s better to be safe than sorry.”

“It’s not just residents we want to reach, but holiday-makers as well.”
Dr Young said she was closely monitoring the unfolding situation in southern states.
“I’m urging Queenslanders travelling to these states to reassess their plans – if it is not necessary, then consider staying here,” she said.
“We’ve worked hard to keep COVID-19 out of the Queensland community and we do not want that to come undone because of complacency.”
Three new cases were reported for the state on Friday, all from international travellers.

Anti-lockdown and vaccine protesters have baselessly described COVID-19 as a “manufactured health crisis” during a freedom rally in Sydney.
Anti-lockdown and vaccine protests have been held across Australia, with hundreds gathering in Sydney to hear from COVID-19 sceptics at a self-described “freedom” rally.
The Sydney protest was observed by police but appeared to remain peaceful, with a NSW Police spokesperson confirming to NCA NewsWire there were no arrests.
The rallies took place despite more significant easing of restrictions in NSW and Victoria following weeks of extremely low or zero case numbers.
This weekend was the first of eased venue restrictions for NSW, with venues other than nightclubs and gyms now permitted to have one person per 2 sqm.
Victoria also announced major changes to its virus rules to take effect on Monday.
Hundreds gathered dressed in yellow in Sydney where speaker Youssra Yatim told the crowd it was not the government’s responsibility to protect the health of their children.
“It’s not the government’s job to tell us what’s in the best interests of our children,” she said.
“In fact, the governments sole purpose is to protect our freedoms and our rights.”
Former nurse Naomi Cook described COVID-19 as a “manufactured health crisis”, while another speaker said the forthcoming vaccine had been rushed.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt told Sky News on Sunday morning he had complete confidence in the Therapeutic Goods Administration and medical experts, who had kept Australia safer than most countries in the world.
He urged against complacency about COVID-19 and said it remained a contagious and deadly virus.
“Vaccination is safe and nothing will be introduced unless it is shown to be absolutely safe for Australians,” he said.
A vaccine is expected to be available first for health workers and, subject to approval, senior Australians in residential care in March, Mr Hunt said.
“We’d like to see all Australians have access to and as many as possible take up the vaccine during the course of 2021,” he said.
“Vaccination is voluntary but we hope it’s taken up as widely as possible, especially by young Australians in their 20s and 30s,” he said.
He said the TGA had given priority assessment to three different vaccines.
“They’re going through the process of assessing the information from what are called clinical trials around the world where you have supervised medical processes with a defined group of people,” he said on Sunday.
“They’re looking at the data ... safety is non-negotiable and the number one priority in our vaccine programs.
“They’re (also) looking at effectiveness, and if they deem those tests to have been met and to have been well met, then they’ll provide an approval.
“There’ll be more data, more vaccines that come in. We have four in our program, but around the world there are over 200 vaccines in development and over 40 in clinical trials.”
Rallies were also held in other cities around the country, including Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Cairns and Canberra.
As of 3.30pm AEDT no arrests had been reported.
Previous anti-lockdown and freedom protests in Melbourne were marred by outbreaks of violence, hundreds of arrests and a controversial police crowd control technique called “kettling”.
Viral coronavirus fragments have been detected in wastewater from a Victorian town, with residents and visitors urged to get tested.
The face of Australia’s COVID-19 response says it’s time to ‘move on’ from the ‘very extreme measures’ states have been forced to take during outbreaks.

The Storm will be without one of their main men this weekend after Christian Welch was stood down for breaching COVID-19 restrictions.
Melbourne Storm prop Christian Welch has been stood down for a breach of COVID-19 restrictions at the club’s Sunshine Coast hub.
The Queensland Origin forward will miss this weekend’s game against Wests Tigers and also faces a possible fine.

The Storm reportedly contacted the NRL Integrity Unit and Queensland government after being made aware of a possible breach, news of which was broken by the Herald Sun.
The publication reported a player — later named as Welch — had been forced into self-isolation after inviting a guest into the quarantine hub overnight.
“I’m incredibly remorseful and sorry for my actions,” Welch said in a statement. “I love this game and everything it has given me and I’m shattered that I have let everyone down.
“Calling my parents to let them know about this was the worst phone call I’ve ever made.
“I know it’s a privilege to play in the NRL and I want to apologise to all for any damage I have caused.”
The Storm travelled to Sydney to play South Sydney on September 4, and from midnight last night would have been back in Queensland for 14 days.
That would have allowed them the same freedoms as regular Queensland residents, but any breach of the “bubble” before the completion of that 14-day isolation period would prove problematic.
It’s been reported Welch’s guest arrived before midnight on Friday, before the rules were eased. However, an Integrity Unit investigation is underway to confirm that is the case.

Storm CEO Dave Donaghy confirmed there was a “possible breach late last night with an unregistered guest coming into the bubble.”
Melbourne relocated to the Sunshine Coast earlier this season when it became clear the coronavirus situation in Victoria was worsening.
The club headed north in June and has been playing its home games in Queensland, while occasionally flying in and out of NSW on game day for other matches.
Craig Bellamy’s troops are preparing for a tilt at the premiership, having surged to second on the ladder with two games to play.
The Storm have won 15 of their 18 matches this season and face the Tigers on Saturday, before finishing the regular season against the Dragons.

A man exposed to a case of COVID-19 at a Sydney gym says he found out on Facebook and wasn’t contacted by health authorities for 10 days.
A man considered a close contact of a COVID-19 case at a Sydney gym says 10 days passed until health authorities told him to self-isolate, and he’s yet to hear anything from Fitness First.
“It seems like a big oversight,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told news.com.au on Tuesday.
He said he exercised at Fitness First Bond Street, the company’s largest club in the CBD, on Thursday, August 20.
RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus coverage
Exactly a week later, NSW Health advised anyone who attended the gym on the afternoon of August 20 or 21 was considered a “casual contact” and should monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, “and if they develop, get tested right away and isolate”.
“NSW Health is calling to advise any close contacts who must immediately self-isolate for 14 days,” it said in a post at 11.14am on August 27.
At 5.39pm that same day, the department issued a public health alert stating it was contacting people who attended on both August 20 and 21 between 12pm and 4.30pm “to determine their level of contact”.
But this gym goer told news.com.au the health department’s contact tracing team didn’t call him until Sunday, August 30.
He was out in public when he was told to “outright get a test and isolate” for two weeks from the date he was potentially exposed to coronavirus.
“At that point, it was about day 10 or 11 of that two-week period,” he told news.com.au.
“I’ve only got to isolate for about three days. I could’ve literally been wandering around with COVID for about 10 days and infecting who knows.
“Fortunately, I’m negative.”
He said his housemate first brought the alert to his attention after seeing it posted on Facebook earlier in the week.
“They (the health department) very clearly knew but took forever to contact me,” he said.
The man noted Fitness First Bond Street is listed as a COVID-19 case location on the NSW Health website under “monitor for symptoms”.
However, it also states: “If you are contacted by NSW Health and identified as a close contact you must immediately self-isolate for 14 days.”

On Tuesday, he said Fitness First was yet to tell him “anything”.
“As far as patron loyalty, I would’ve expected something from Fitness First. Especially as this is not isolated,” he said.
He said the Bond Street facility is closed on weekends but given it is for “Platinum” members they can access every other Fitness First in the country, aside from the “Titanium” club at Barangaroo.
On August 30, NSW Health advised people who used the weights room at Fitness First in Randwick between 3.30pm and 4.15pm on August 23 they were “considered close contacts of a previously reported case and should immediately isolate for 14 days since that date and get tested.”
A member of that gym branch, in the city’s eastern suburbs, told news.com.au they were contacted by NSW Health after attending on that day but had also signed a friend in as a “guest”, which they described as “common practice”.
“If a visiting friend or family member wants to workout with you, they’ll receive access to the same privileges as you for a nominal fee,” Fitness First states on its website, noting it is $22 to attend “as a guest of a member”.
The company also offers free guest passes for a trial of the gym, valid for one day and to be redeemed within seven days from the date of issue.
The gym goer said NSW Health did not contact their friend and claimed the department “had no idea that signing in as a guest was an option”.
The global fitness brand has had a number of people positive for COVID-19 attend its gyms in NSW including at Fitness First Balgowlah.
The person was at the gym in northern Sydney from 9am to 12pm on August 23.
“If you are contacted by NSW Health and identified as a close contact you must immediately self-isolate for 14 days,” the department states.
The facilities in Rockdale, St Leonards and Kings Cross have also been attended by positive coronavirus cases since July.
A NSW Health spokesperson said the agency works with pulic health officials “immediately after a case tests positive”.
“A case notified on the evening of 25 August attended Bond St Fitness First prior to testing positive. As soon as information about this location was known, NSW Health distributed a public health alert to the media.
“NSW Health then worked with the gym, including undertaking a site visit to assess the potential contact of more than 1500 people who had accessed the gym on 20 and 21 August. Subsequently, NSW Health called all known potentially exposed gym members to discuss the potential level of risk.”
The spokesperson said those deemed close contact must quarantine for 14 days after their visit.
“Any close contacts who develop symptoms must get tested for COVID-19. Other gym members should look out for symptoms and get tested immediately if even the mildest of symptoms develop.”
A Fitness First spokesperson said the safety of members, staff and visitors “remains a top priority”.
“Fitness First has followed all NSW Health advice and guidelines relating to any individuals who tested positive to COVID-19 that have visited our clubs, including Bond Street,” the spokesperson said.
“This includes providing them promptly with the details of all members and staff, as well as visitors’ data who are required to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms as a result of potentially being in contact with the individual.
“Based on advice from NSW Health, all contact tracing relating to a positive COVID-19 case in NSW is managed directly by NSW Health as the appropriate authority to offer the necessary health advice.”

A religious study retreat is the likely cause of an expanding coronavirus cluster linked to a girls school in Sydney’s northwest.
A study and prayer retreat may have triggered an outbreak of COVID-19 at Tangara School for Girls, Cherrybrook, in Sydney’s northwest.
As of 8pm Tuesday, 17 cases had been linked to the school, including 11 students and a staff member. The rest are believed to be close contacts.
“The original source of this cluster remains under investigation,” NSW Health said on Tuesday.
However, The Sydney Morning Herald reports several students who tested positive attended a retreat at a convention centre in Bargo.
The school said it did not arrange the retreat and it was co-ordinated by the Eremeran study centre with the Catholic organisation Opus Dei.
The school’s secondary campus remains closed until August 24 while the junior campus was scheduled to reopen on Wednesday for students whose parents need to send their children to school.
“All students, staff and support staff of the secondary school must self-isolate for 14 days and get tested, regardless of symptoms,” the health department said.
It encouraged students at the primary school to monitor symptoms and get tested no matter how mild.
Parramatta Public School will also be closed on Wednesday after a student tested positive to COVID-19.
“We wish to advise that Parramatta Public School will be non-operational for on-site learning tomorrow. All students will undertake at home learning tomorrow,” the school said.
It’s outside school hours care program has been suspended.
“All staff and students are asked to self-isolate while contact tracing occurs,” the school said.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged schools to cancel any extra-curricular activities.
“Extra-curricular activities, those excursions and overnight things which ordinarily you would do, are not acceptable during a pandemic,” she said.
NSW recorded 22 new coronavirus on Tuesday.
Sixteen were locally acquired and linked to known cases, four were returned travellers in hotel quarantine, one was from Victoria and one remains under investigation.

Restrictions have tightened for people trying to enter New South Wales from Victoria, leaving regional communities concerned.
It was “chaos” at the New South Wales and Victoria border on Thursday as returning residents rushed to enter the state before the latest wave of COVID-19 restrictions came into force.
From 12.01am on Friday anyone entering NSW from Victoria will be required to self-isolate in a hotel for two weeks and, unless they live in border towns, will no longer be able to return by road.
Member for Murray Helen Dalton told NCA NewsWire it was “chaotic” at the border on Thursday, and she held grave concerns about the impact new restrictions would have on border residents living in regional NSW but outside the border bubble.
“Most of the medical services are over the other side (in Victoria), and if you live in Moama, say, your closest hospital is over 70km away in Deniliquin,” she explained.
“It’s a huge dilemma for people who have a pre-existing condition and travel into Victoria frequently for medical care.”
The rules around who can get a border exemption have tightened in a bid to restrict who can enter NSW from the virus-riddled state without having to go into mandatory hotel quarantine.
Earlier this week NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared anyone crossing the southern border would be subject to two weeks mandatory quarantine in one of the state’s “health hotels”.
Individuals will also be required to foot the $3000 bill.
As part of the further restrictions people – unless they live within the border zones – will not be able to access NSW by road, making Sydney airport the only entry point.
There are exceptions though.
For instance, critical workers will not have to quarantine, but it’s up to their employer to prove the worker is an essential employee. Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said this would result in a “very, very small category of exemptions”.
Examples of critical workers include those working in mining, energy or manufacturing, defence force personnel and those providing medical care.
The State Government said there was no change to existing arrangements for border communities.
But Ms Dalton believes there needs to be a more suitable exemption system for people who must travel across the border every day for work and may live outside the border zone.
“I understand we need these harsher rules, but they’re really hurting the people of NSW,” she said.
“But we obviously don’t want COVID-19 in our areas.”
She said rules around the current permit system were constantly changing and causing confusion among residents.
“It’s been really stressful for people,” Ms Dalton said.
At the moment, a permit system is in place for residents who frequently cross the border for work, study or healthcare. But if they travel beyond the border zones they will be required to self-isolate for two weeks.
Murray River Council Mayor Chris Bilkey agreed it was a challenging time for residents, particularly if they travel regularly for medical care, but that the restrictions are necessary.
NSW Health confirmed anyone travelling to Victoria from outside the NSW border bubble would need to apply for an exemption and self-isolate in a hotel upon their return.
But the spokesperson urged any NSW residents, who previously sought medical care in Victoria, should speak with their local health department to find a better alternative.
Otherwise they would face mandatory quarantine every time they returned, the department said.
Ms Dalton anticipates wait times at the border should improve given the new restrictions on road travel for anyone outside the border areas, which is a small win for local residents.
“It would have to ease traffic, but every day is a bit different, isn’t it?” Ms Dalton said.
“The Government is enforcing all these rules, but it’s very ‘suck it and see’ what the fallout is.”
Victorians can also travel on compassionate grounds, but NSW Health say there is a strict criteria and circumstances are limited.
Even if a person does gain permission to enter the state, they will be forbidden from visiting any other location aside from their hotel or the address they are staying and will be expected to isolate.
Eleven new cases of COVID-19 were recorded in NSW on Friday.

A young man who caught COVID-19 at a pub in NSW had “one of the highest infection levels ever seen”, health authorities say.
A young man who caught coronavirus at the Crossroads Hotel in Casula had “one of the highest infection levels we’ve ever seen”, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has revealed.
“We’ve got a young bloke from that latest cluster … he had one of the highest infection levels we’ve ever seen,” Mr Hazzard told Ben Fordham on 2GB.
“His viral load was quite capable of spreading it to anybody near him … we all need to be on high alert.”
Mr Hazzard said the information should serve as a dire warning to young people, who make up 40 per cent of coronavirus cases, that the virus was “extremely dangerous”.
Younger people rarely experience life-threatening symptoms but are proving to be more infectious than older people.
“I’ve been talking to the health tracers, and they tell me young people get out and about in the evening and they go a lot of places,” he said.
“They can be super spreaders with great skill and acumen.”
There have been 34 cases in New South Wales linked to the outbreak at the Sydney pub, with new cases popping up all over the state daily.
In response, the NSW Government has tightened restrictions around pubs, lowering the gathering limit from 20 to 10, and promised to crack down on businesses that don’t have a COVID-safe plan or are not following it.
“This virus is still out and about,” Mr Hazard said.
“As I said to someone yesterday, it’s a very speedy virus, it could win a gold medal at the Olympics. Until we can get a vaccine, there’s no way we’re out of the woods.”
The Crossroads cluster is believed to have stemmed from a Melbourne man who worked for a freight company and was visiting an office in Sydney.
Health tracers say he and several of his colleagues went to the pub for a work party on July 3, leading to an outbreak that has since spread across Sydney to more than 20 businesses from Highfields in Caringbah to Macarthur Tavern in Campbelltown.

Saliva testing for coronavirus could be the way of the future, with people able to test themselves for COVID-19 at home. But there are those who have their doubts.
Saliva testing for COVID-19 being used in Victoria has been labelled “too inaccurate” and “not as good as throat swabs” by New South Wales’ chief health officer and Melbourne researchers.
Developed by scientists at Victoria’s Doherty Institute, the saliva test has already replaced the traditional nasal swab in Melbourne’s suburban blitz with more than 100 residents in Keilor Downs among the first to be tested.
While Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin hinted at the saliva test potentially becoming a “home-based” coronavirus test in future, questions remain about how effective the test really is.
“The test was first validated on 600 specimens collected at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and actually performed well but not as well as the throat swab,” Professor Lewin told reporters yesterday.
The Doherty Institute found nasal and throat swabs were 95 per cent accurate, while saliva was between 84.6 per cent and 87 per cent.
“The advantage of the saliva test of course is that it’s much more acceptable for people to give a specimen,” Prof Lewin said.
“People just need to collect saliva in their mouth for a minute or two and then spit it into a small jar, and then that small jar gets sent off to the laboratory.”
Prof Lewin saliva tests could be “home-based tests” in the future.
“You could take this test at home and send it in, that would be the perfect outcome, but there is still a bit of work to go,” she said.
But Alfred Health infectious diseases epidemiology professor Allen Cheng told NCA NewsWire people should still opt for throat swabs.
“Saliva testing is not as good as throat swabs,” he said.
“If you can be tested by throat or nose then you should. Saliva testing should only be a last resort but is more accessible and can help break down the barrier in getting more people tested.”
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant told a parliamentary inquiry yesterday the saliva test would not be used across the state because it was not accurate enough.
Victoria recorded 75 new cases of coronavirus yesterday, an increase of 24 on Sunday’s figures.
The Doherty Institute has been approached for comment.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/nsw-outlines-what-happens-if-there-is-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-at-schools/news-story/7436d81af301decb5cdeedcc828e315a
The NSW Premier has warned parents to prepare themselves for school closures, outlining what will happen if there is a COVID-19 outbreak at schools.
NSW authorities have revealed what will happen if there is an outbreak of coronavirus at a school with students returning to classes today on a staged basis.
On Monday students returned for one day of face-to-face learning per week, with attendance to increase over the course of the term.
The state government is working towards a target of a full-scale return by term three.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said parents should expect schools to temporarily close if coronavirus cases were detected.
“We’ll put in a pop-up clinic, we’ll have a number of initiatives to really control the spread in that community,” she told reporters this morning.
“As was evidenced last week when a child had the coronavirus at Warragamba Public School, we ensured there was a pop up clinic in the vicinity of the school, we encouraged people to get tested and now the health department is confident any community transmission in that area has been under control.”
She said schools would be shut down for a deep clean if a teacher or student was confirmed to have COVID-19.
“In an environment where there’s thousands of schools, tens of thousands of students and teacher and parents moving about, we can expect that to occur from time to time. That will be the new normal when it comes to education,” she said.
A huge operation is also underway to ensure schools have enough cleaning products as supplies remain hard to source.

“We have spent the past month putting in extra supplies, getting extra cleaning – imagine getting an extra contract for cleaning for every extra 2200 schools, plus all the extra supplies – a lot of work has gone on behind the scenes,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Ms Berejiklian said she hoped schooling would look pretty normal by the end of May.
The premier said Year 12 students will be back in public schools on average three days a week, with some Year 12 students going back full time this week.
“If the next two weeks go well, we expect to have full-time face-to-face teaching very quickly in New South Wales, by the end of May,” she said.
“As I have said, we anticipate there will be face-to-face teaching and in many, if not the majority of our schools. We have to appreciate that NSW has schools with the size as small as 10, in some of the regional communities and as large as 2000.
“Don’t assume every single school will be doing everything exactly the same.
“We have given flexibility to our schools, our principals and teachers know there is some flexibility within the school community to apply things as you see fit. That is absolutely fine.”

However, the return to classrooms has come with a warning, with Ms Berejiklian promising that any surge in numbers of confirmed cases could see a return to tighter measures.
“If there is evidence or if there is data that shows … a huge spike, then we’ll have to go backwards,” Berejiklian said.
“But similarly, if the data shows us that we’re doing better than expected, we can move forward and be faster.”
The government has urged parents to be vigilant about their children’s health and to keep them away from school if they exhibit any symptoms of coronavirus.
Social distancing guidelines will be maintained in classrooms and extra health measures will be in place, including additional cleaning and health equipment in sick bays.
Lunch breaks will also be staggered.
Ms Berejiklian said it was not compulsory to send children to school and parents would not be penalised for keeping them at home.
“It’s never been compulsory to force parents to do one thing or another, we’ve been very clear about that in New South Wales,” she said.
“But our strong recommendation is that face-to-face teaching needs to start.
“We want to get to fulltime face-to-face teaching as soon as we can. And the best health advice is that schools are safe environments.”
NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said more than 2000 litres of liquid soap, 22,000 bars of soap, over 42,000 bottles of hand sanitiser and 20,000 toilet rolls had been dispatched to schools.
“In addition, a first aid room care package containing personal protective equipment and a non-contact temperature monitor has been dispatched to every school in NSW.
“A rolling program of deliveries is scheduled to continue to meet the needs of schools on an ongoing basis.”
Additional cleaning of bathrooms and high-touch surfaces will be done throughout the day.
The Berejiklian on Sunday announced the winding back of restrictions from Friday, including allowing people to leave their homes for recreation. The new relaxing of restrictions will allow up to five people to visit a home, including children.
Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people will also be allowed, such as a physical training session or sitting down in a park.
Restaurants and cafes will also be allowed to have up to 10 patrons at a time, while ensuring they maintain social distancing of 1.5 metres between people and four square metres space per person.
A total of 10 guests will be allowed at weddings, and up to 20 people at indoor funerals and up to 30 at outdoor funerals.
Religious gatherings and places of worship can also welcome up to 10 worshippers.

New South Wales Chief Medical Officer Dr Kerry Chant says infectious control experts have found practical breaches among healthcare workers. 

Speaking in Sydney on Saturday, Dr Chant said two senior infection control practitioners visited aged care facilities on Friday and found safety procedures could be improved. 

“We know it requires meticulous consistent adherence to processes to ensure against transmission,” she said. 

“It’s not just about a mask, but gloves, a gown and taking it all off in a particular order to make sure you don’t contaminate your hands. 

“So there are a lot of requirements to do things consistently. 

"That's obviously the focus of yesterday's visit to the aged care facility, we had two very senior infection control practitioners to relook at strengthening procedures." 

Dr Chant issued a renewed warning to healthcare workers to stay at home and get tested for COVID-19 at the first sign of illness. 

“This is not a blame game, but this is a key lesson,” she said.

The coronavirus infection cluster in a Sydney aged care home has claimed four more victims, taking the total death toll to a devastating 11.
Another four residents have died at the virus-plagued Newmarch aged care home in Western Sydney, bringing the total number of COVID-19 deaths at the facility to 11 in the past two weeks.
More than 50 staff and residents have tested positive since the outbreak was detected, which began when an infected employee worked for several days before being diagnosed.
Anglicare, which runs the home, said it is "deeply saddened" by the latest deaths.

"We extend our deepest sympathies to these families for the losses they are experiencing," it said in a statement.
"On the best advice available, we know that it will be some weeks before the home is clear of the virus.
"For those residents with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, NSW Health has provided the support and guidance of Nepean Blue Mountains Local Area Health Network and an Infectious Diseases Specialist to ensure residents receive the best medical care possible."
The Federal Government was forced to intervene last week when it emerged that Newmarch House was significantly understaffed.
Loved ones of residents voiced their concerns about the quality of care being offered.
"This is a tragic time not only for the families who have lost their loved ones but for other residents and families," Anglicare said.
"It is also taking a deep toll on our staff who cared for and knew these residents and families so well."
The shocking news today comes as multiple states confirmed their plans earlier on Tuesday to begin relaxing some social distancing restrictions.
Although, not all jurisdictions are on board.
Australia has now recorded 6728 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 3009 in New South Wales, 1351 in Victoria, 1033 in Queensland, 438 in South Australia, 550 in Western Australia, 214 in Tasmania, 106 in the Australian Capital Territory and 28 in the Northern Territory.
A total of 89 deaths have been recorded nationally.
The details of the four deaths today are yet to be confirmed but it is understood a 93-year-old man is among the four who have died.

The total number of coronavirus cases in Australia stands at 6,394 and the death toll remains at 61. 

New South Wales recorded seven new cases of the virus overnight, while Victoria recorded another 10 and Queensland another 11. 

The total number of Australians who have recovered from COVID-19 sits at more than 3,400. 

Authorities said the curve was flattening but urged caution as Australia was not yet out of the woods. 

Meanwhile, the global death toll has risen to 119,000 and the number of coronavirus cases has climbed passed 1.9 million across the world.

A leaked document shows all the cases of coronavirus at NSW schools and the hundreds of students and teachers forced into quarantine.
Hundreds of students and staff have been forced into self-quarantine as a result of confirmed COVID-19 cases at school underlining the risks of returning to normal school operations.
As the Prime Minister urges schools to remain open for essential workers, a confidential list of NSW schools where outbreaks have occurred obtained by news.com.au reveals the ‘close contacts’ of COVID-19 patients have in some cases stretched to more than 100 students and staff at a school.
At most schools, all of these contacts were contacted and urged to self-quarantine at home, to ensure they were not displaying symptoms of the coronavirus.
There is no information provided in the tally of schools on whether further cases were recorded suggesting transmission at the school.
However, the students and staff deemed close contacts were not tested for COVID-19 unless they displayed symptoms including a dry cough and a fever.
Scott Morrison will urge state premiers to consider new COVID-19 measures at a meeting of national cabinet today to re-open more schools including allowing older teachers to work from home and staggering classes to reduce mass gatherings.
State premiers and the PM will discuss online learning options for children amid fears kids are being set as little as one or two hours of schoolwork a day as stressed parents juggle working from home with distance learning.
Teachers are calling for a staggered approach that might see face-to-face teaching return only for Year 12s and Kindergarten students in Term 2 or 3 before other years were phased in over subsequent weeks.
“Clearly some of the attention now has turned to at what point are the restrictions lifted,’’ NSW Teachers’ Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said.
“At that point, we would need to look at some orderly resumption of school operations. Staggering that return would be an obvious option.
“There are concerns in schools about infection rates. The health advice is very clear: there are at-risk groups including those who have chronic illnesses, pregnant teachers.”
The Prime Minister has consistently maintained there’s no medical advice calling for schools to close and called for them to remain open for workers who cannot care for children at home.

But Victoria and the ACT are defying that order and urging parents not to send their children to school in Term 2.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced that Term 2 will be largely conducted remotely online, claiming that sending one million kids back to school would “spread the virus” and warned if students can stay at home they must stay at home.
In Canberra, the ACT Government has gone further, announcing it will no longer open all schools even to emergency service workers in Term 2. That’s despite low levels of infection in the nation’s capital where only 99 cases have been confirmed.
For children who cannot stay home, supervision will be provided at a small number of school sites that are yet to be announced.
Privately, federal officials believe the states moved to suspend face-to-face classes prematurely, under pressure from teachers’ unions and against the advice of the chief medical officers.
Health Minister Greg Hunt insisted this week there was no change to the official advice that schools were safe to attend during the coronavirus pandemic.
“There’s been no change in the advice, but I know that schools are a matter being considered by the National Cabinet over the coming days,’’ he said.
Education Minister Dan Tehan said some states were moving towards to reopening more quickly than others. In the Northern Territory the expectation is schools will remain open for all children and the borders will remain closed.
“It’ll differ for primary school to secondary school, and each jurisdiction is looking at their arrangements. And, a lot of it is being determined by the spread of the pandemic – where that’s at with each state and territory,’’ he said.
“Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, are looking at different arrangements, as well. So, what we’re going to have is a nationally consistent approach, whereby there’s a clear commitment from all states and territories: If your parents are working and your children can’t be supervised at home, then the school will be open for you. That’s a nationally consistent message.”
NSW Premer Gladys Berejiklian has announced the NSW government will be providing free pre-school for the next six months and was considering what Term 2 will look like.
“There are some options we’re considering,” she said. “But again it will be based on health advice and in consultation with all of our stakeholders, including principals and teachers and parent groups as well.”

A fan’s random act of kindness sparked fears of a biosecurity breach but mixed messages from the BCCI and CA have added to the confusion.
The Board of Cricket Control in India have denied the members of the Indian cricket team seen dining out in Melbourne have breached COVID-19 biosecurity protocols but Cricket Australia released a statement saying it was still being investigated.
Cricket tragic Navaldeep Singh spotted Indian squad members Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill, Prithvi Shaw and Navdeep Saini were seen dining in a restaurant on Friday afternoon.
While boasting about the encounter on social media, Singh claimed Pant “hugged” him after he generously paid their $118.69 restaurant bill.
As of Saturday afternoon, Singh’s video has registered more than 250,000 views on Twitter.

As reported by The Daily Telegraph’s Ben Horne, Cricket Australia’s strict biosecurity guidelines dictate players should only dine in public outdoors, but the Indian quintet is seemingly indoors without masks.
According to the report, the incident would be examined by CA, but ultimately it was a matter for the The Board of Control for Cricket in India.
Late on Saturday night, Cricket Australia released a statement saying “The BCCI and CA are investigating the matter and seeking to determine whether the outing constitutes a breach of biosecurity protocols”.
“In the interim, on the advice of the Australian and Indian medical teams, the aforementioned players have been placed in isolation as a precaution,” the statement read. “This will include separating the group of players from the broader Indian and Australian squads when traveling and at the training venue.
“Players will be permitted to train in accordance with the strict protocols that have been put in place to ensure the ongoing safety of all members of the Indian and Australian squads.
“Similar measures were taken during the BBL this season after it was determined two Brisbane Heat players failed to comply with tournament biosecurity protocols.”

The Sydney Morning Herald’s Andrew Wu identified the restaurant was Secret Kitchen, a noodles and BBQ restaurant at Chadstone Shopping Centre.
He added that the BCCI had launched an investigation into the New Year’s Day meal after being alerted by the publication and that it would review the video but had declined to comment further.
But a senior member of the BCCI has reportedly rubbished the reports while Indian journalist Boria Majumdar said “there is no investigation for a breach confirms @BCCI and never was such a thing even under consideration”.
“No, there has been no breach in bio-security protocols. Everyone associated with the Indian team is well aware of the protocols,’ the official told the Press Trust of India on conditions of anonymity.
“We can only term it as a malicious spin by a section of Australian media and this has started after their humiliating defeat.
“The Australian media at times acts as an extension of their cricket team.”
Earlier in the afternoon, the fan went back to Twitter as his video went viral to try to shut down the investigation.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian has weighed in after police targeted drivers waiting for hours at a Sydney testing clinic and handed out $349 fines.
NSW Police have been blasted over the “cruel” decision to fine people who lined up for hours at Sydney’s Bondi Beach COVID-19 testing clinic.
The government has called on people with even the mildest symptoms to go and get tested for coronavirus as the northern beaches cluster continues to grow.
Thousands of people have responded to the call, with testing clinics across Sydney packed with people wanting to do their part to help contain the outbreak.
With so many people rushing to get tested the wait times at the clinics increased dramatically, with some people having to wait up to seven hours.

Residents in the city’s eastern suburbs had to wait for hours in their cars before undergoing the uncomfortable nose swab test, and then were thanked for their efforts with a $349 fine and five demerit points.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian addressed the fines during her press conference on Tuesday, saying she understands nine people were handed infringements.
“Seven of those fines have been revoked but I understand for two of those fines, there were additional issues,” she said.
“Common sense prevailed and we always ask for discretion at this time.”
Multiple people who attended the Bondi Beach testing clinic on Saturday told the Daily Mailpolice were patrolling the queue and fining people who were caught using their mobile phone during the wait.
One woman said she saw officers taking photos of people’s licence plates and issuing fines to people in line around her.
During the wait, she was using her Kindle device to read during the wait and was reportedly told by an officer she was “lucky” it wasn’t a mobile phone.
She told the publication that she believes the officer came over to her because her keys were in the ignition.
The rules on the Transport for NSW website state that to use a mobile phone, “you must be parked out of the line of traffic. However, the ignition does not need to be turned off.”
“The line was right up the hill at North Bondi and I had already been in the line for two hours,” she said.
“I would have understood if he was politely issuing a reminder but the whole situation seemed unfair.”
She said the wait was about six hours and she felt it was “a bit cruel” to target people who were trying to do the right thing and get tested.
A NSW Police spokesperson told news.com.au that a number of traffic infringements were issued to motorists in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on December 19.
“These infringements are being reviewed by NSW Police,” the spokesperson said.
Twitter user Paul Cheever said his friend had waited for seven hours at the same clinic and was hit with a fine for using her phone to pass the time.
A friend of ours was waiting for testing in a 7 hour queue in Bondi this morning when she was booked by police for using her phone.  And she was only there because she works in an office in Bondi and wanted to âdo the right thingâ.
Another woman told the Daily Mail said she was waiting in the testing line on Saturday morning when she was approached by a police officer.
She had her car off and was playing with her phone while her dog sat on her lap, promoting the officer to reportedly threaten to give her two tickets.
“I felt like going ‘get stuffed, I’m trying to do the right thing here’,” she told the publication.
It is illegal to hold and use a mobile phone at any time while driving and, in NSW, comes with a $349 fine and five demerit points. This increases to 10 demerit points during double demerit periods.
RELATED: Call for ‘painful’ Christmas lockdown
NSW recorded 15 COVID-19 infections on Monday, with more than 38,000 people coming forward to get tested over the 24 hour period.
The northern beaches cluster has risen to 83 cases, with the area still under stay at home orders.
Restrictions around gatherings and venue limits have been reinstated across Greater Sydney, the Central Coast, the Blue Mountains and Wollongong.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said key decisions around what restrictions will be in place over Christmas will be announced on Wednesday morning.
“This is an ongoing and evolving situation and we know how contagious the virus is,” she said on Monday.
“I appreciate how frustrating it is, and I would love to be able to tell everybody today what Christmas might look like in New South Wales or the Northern Beaches. But we’re not in a position to do that yet.
“And I appreciate the community has been extremely patient, but I also appreciate, I think that the community understands our position.”

A police error that allowed two German nationals to bypass hotel quarantine in Sydney is “not the gold standard” expected, the WA Premier has warned.
A police bungle that allowed two German nationals to skip quarantine in Sydney is unlikely to derail WA’s plans for quarantine-free travel from NSW and Victoria, but the Premier warns it is “not the gold standard” expected.
A 53-year-old woman and 15-year-old boy flew into Sydney airport but were able to bypass quarantine to fly straight to Melbourne, where they were immediately intercepted by authorities and taken to a hotel.
NSW Police have accepted blame for the error, saying systems at the airport have now been reviewed and strengthened.
WA Premier Mark McGowan said it was “obviously concerning”.
“I haven’t had an explanation. It’s certainly not the gold standard,” he told reporters on Sunday.
“Fortunately, both of them were not positive — they’ve both been tested — but it obviously shows that COVID is a risk and that’s why we continue to have a controlled border in place to ensure we can protect people into the future.”
Asked if WA was still on track to allow quarantine-free travel to people in NSW and Victoria from Tuesday, Mr McGowan said: “We will wait until tomorrow to see all of the testing results out of NSW.”
The Premier said there had been no reports of new cases in NSW on Saturday after about 12,000 tests were conducted.
But he wanted to “wait and see” what other testing was done on Sunday before making a final decision about WA’s border arrangements on Monday.
“Along the COVID pathway, there’s been lots and lots and lots of issues and mistakes made,” Mr McGowan said.
“The good thing is we’ve always taken a very precautionary and very cautious approach.
“NSW currently has no community spread of the virus but because we have the controlled border in place, if we have to, we can put the hard border back in place in a heartbeat.”
WA last month moved from a hard border to a controlled interstate border with other jurisdictions, except South Australia following its outbreak.
It means people can travel to WA without quarantining for two weeks, but they must complete a G2G Pass and be screened upon arrival.
Many WA businesses are now being forced to keep a register of patrons and staff to help COVID-19 contact tracing, with a QR code system among the options.
Businesses that must keep a register include restaurants, cafes, bars, nightclubs, gyms, sporting centres, places of worship, hairdressers, museums, cinemas, theatres, real estate inspections, zoos, amusement parks and accommodation facilities.
But on Saturday night the Safe WA app crashed, forcing people to sign in manually at venues rather than use the QR code system.
“I’m advised there was a 15 minute outage in relation to the system,” Mr McGowan said.
About 625,000 people have so far downloaded the app, while more than 18,000 businesses have signed up.
WA recorded two new cases of coronavirus overnight – both men aged in their 50s, who are in hotel quarantine.
It brings the state’s total number of infections to 830, including 13 active cases.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/smart/camping-in-the-age-of-covid19-gets-fancy-at-the-fireside/news-story/5469356d43f5274223fb424ad05a85d7
Campfire cooking has come a long way since the days of tinned beans and mystery meat. As the nation gets itchy feet for domestic travel, fireside food is being transformed.
Creature comforts treasured throughout COVID have transformed the traditional campsite, as Australians flex new-found culinary skills around the campfire. If home-cooking emerged as the humble hero of lockdown, it’s only heating up now many of us are eagerly hitting the road. For Victorians longing to throw a log, it’s prime time to map out logistics for your next fireside feast.
Before you pack the boot, here’s the low-down from those in the know: Monica Robinson, co-founder of award-winning providores The Other Chef, and keen camper and mum of two Lina Bergefall, our SMART spy on the, er, ground.
PREPARATION PAYS
All successful, comfortable campers are organised list-makers and meal planners. Regular campers know things, so ask them for advice and save yourself time, money, effort and sanity down the track.
“I often start our planning two days ahead,” Lina says. “We write lists and figure out exactly what we’re going to eat.”
DO YOUR RESEARCH
Everything you need to know about lifting your luxe game is available online – search ‘glamping’ and start scrolling. Countless devotees and operators freely share information and recipes. Aussie Bush Camping is one popular Facebook group, or try Finex’s treasure trove of mouth-watering recipes, specially suited to its range of cast iron camping cookware.
Note what’s available near your campsite and support local farmers and regional artisans once you arrive.
“If there are providores or markets selling locally made products, then all the better to seek some of that out,” Monica says. “If they’re camping somewhere close to markets or they can get some locally produced products, that’s improving their camp cooking experience, but it’s also helping out the local economy and small businesses at the same time.”
TRY IT, YOU’LL LIKE IT
Monica says campers are more willing to try new flavours and food ideas since COVID, adding special items to their own store of provisions.
“They’re willing to experiment a bit more with their cooking,” Monica says. “If they’re camping, it doesn’t mean they have to have simple camp food, they can still have something really tasty.”
THE CONDIMENT IS KING
Camping is the ideal environment for quality condiments to shine. Preserves and pastes travel well and lift the bland to the beautiful in a jiffy.
“Condiments can bring so many flavours to a meal or even a basic sandwich or burger,” Monica says. “You can really lift it to another level.”
GOOD GEAR IS GOLD
The camp oven – also known as a bedourie or Dutch oven – is changing campsite menus around the country. Whether you choose premium cast iron or an affordable spun steel variety, this piece of kit is key.
“Our cooking really lifted when we bought the bedourie,” Lina says. “It’s really made the cooking interesting and fun and opens up a lot of possibilities.
“We invested more in our equipment now because we think this is probably the kind of holiday that we can expect for the next year.”
REVIVE, NOT JUST SURVIVE
Everyone has been through enough this year without the family camping trip becoming an endurance test.
“Camping (is) how we charge our batteries and that’s our holiday, so food is really important to us,” Lina says. “We spend more time and effort on it right now and it is really increasing.
“Make sure that you treat it like a holiday. You’re supposed to have nice meals and a good sleep, it’s not just surviving.”
FANCY CAMPS
Small improvements go a long way in elevating camping from rough to regal. Here are three simple places to start:
1. Let a hero ingredient do the heavy-lifting and avoid complicated recipes. Camping near a fishing port? Nothing says cordon bleu camping like lobster on the grill.
2. Choose condiments with culinary range. A bacon and egg breakfast roll is a camping staple, but add relish from a local roadside stall or farmers’ market and you’ve hit the jackpot. Add a dollop to your cheeseboard at sunset and jazz up steak or prawns at dinner.
3. A good meal should be followed by a sound sleep. Don’t put all the pizzazz in the pot – give some thought to improving your interior comforts as well.

Victorians and Queenslanders are facing six-hour queues at testing clinics as authorities plead for patience.
Thousands of Australians desperate to do the right thing are being turned away from, or facing queues of up to six hours at COVID-19 testing clinics across the country.
Melbourne, Brisbane and Gold Coast centres are all reporting massive wait times on Sunday, after desperate pleas from Victorian and Queensland authorities.
Meanwhile, New South Wales Health is urging more people to get tested, after the state recorded eight new cases on Sunday morning out of 18,923 tests.
Despite the long queue times, Queensland continued its run of zero COVID-19 cases on Sunday.
On Saturday, Queensland’s chief health officer said anyone in Queensland who had entered the state from Victoria since December 21 to immediately get tested and isolate until they received a negative result.
It prompted hundreds to flock to Brisbane’s only late-night testing clinic, the Royal Brisbane Hospital, only to be told they could not be tested as the centre was closing at 9pm.
Thousands of Queenslanders have spent Sunday morning standing or sitting in queues, some as long as six hours.
ABC Breakfast host Lisa Millar tweeted from a Gold Coast clinic that she had moved “about 100 metres since she joined the queue two hours ago.”
“People arriving now are being told they may not get tested before end of the day now,” she wrote at 12.20pm AEST.
Line is moving but slowly. Iâve moved about 100 metres since I joined 2 hours ago. Everyone being very patient but people arriving now are being told they may not get tested before end of the day now. https://t.co/xfJTJ5Dg7G
Shadow Minister for Health, Ros Bates said the state could not afford to have one person “who may have COVID-19 turned away.”
“As a registered nurse, I know the immense pressure our hard working hospital staff are under,” she said.
“Our police officers are patrolling our border 24/7, yet testing clinics are closing at 9pm? It doesn’t make sense.”
In Victoria, authorities are urging people to be patient as they too experience massive wait times, with some clinics being forced to close their doors due to reaching capacity.
Despite that, the state recorded 22,477 tests in the 24 hours to Sunday morning with just three positive cases, all linked to the Black Rock cluster.
Acting premier Jacinta Allan said delays at the state’s 190 testing clinics were in part due to many healthcare workers still being on leave.
“I do want to acknowledge the hardworking healthcare staff over the course of 2020 … they have worked so hard to protect and support the Victorian community. Over this holiday period we have seen a number of them take some well earned time off,” Ms Allan said.
“I really want to thank those staff who have returned early from their breaks to provide extra assistance with the testing sites across the state.”
COVID-19 Commander Jeroen Weimar said more testing sites would be opened over coming days.
“Every test is important in this environment and I thank everybody who is making such a heroic effort,” he said.
All 13 Department of Health and Human Services drive-through clinics will be open until 8pm for the foreseeable future.
The Melbourne Showgrounds testing centre will also remain open until 7pm.

Queensland Health has warned specific passengers who travelled on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney on Monday alongside a woman who has since tested positive to COVID-19 are now deemed “close contacts”.
A public health alert has been issued for a southside Brisbane suburb after a woman tested positive for COVID-19 after dining at a cafe and catching a domestic flight.
Japanese health authorities advised on Wednesday that a woman had tested positive to the virus after returning to Japan from Brisbane via Sydney.
Queensland Health have issued a coronavirus public health alert for Virgin flight VA962 from Brisbane to Sydney on Monday, August 17.
In a statement, Queensland Health said that people who travelled in rows 25 to 29 on the flight were deemed to be “close contacts” of the woman.

The alert has also been issued for The Jam Pantry cafe in Greenslopes, after she visited on Sunday, August 16.
The state’s Chief Health Officer Jeanette Young said contact tracing was under way and appropriate action had been taken at the relevant locations.
Dr Young said the woman had skipped quarantine in Brisbane because she had completed 14 days in isolation in Sydney.
“Because she quarantined in Sydney and travelled straight to Brisbane from hotel quarantine, she could go about her normal life in Brisbane,” she said.
“However, on her arrival to Japan on 18 August, she was asymptomatic but returned a positive COVID-19 result.”
She said she was working with New South Wales Health to contact people from the flight and asked that all passengers monitor their health and come forward for testing if they have any symptoms.
The Public Health Unit would now contact anyone who attended The Jam Pantry between 9.45am and 11am on Sunday.
“We have been in touch with six close contacts in Brisbane identified by the woman. These people have been tested and are now in quarantine,” Dr Young said.
“While we are still determining where the virus may have been acquired, we are working with Japanese authorities to gather necessary information.”

A committee established to consider one state’s next steps for COVID-19 is looking at a number of issues due to the “worrying risk” over the border.
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall says while the state is “enjoying a very different” COVID-19 situation to others, a targeted team is weighing up current restrictions with the “worrying risk just directly across our border”.
The state reinstated restrictions on Tuesday night on social gatherings and licensed venues.
Home gatherings were reduced from 50 people to 10 while pubs, bars and restaurants must only serve alcohol to seated patrons.

WHAT ELSE IS BEING CONSIDERED
Mr Marshall on Friday said the Transition Committee – established in May to manage the “next steps” in dealing with the coronavirus – had met in Adelaide.
“I can report to you that there are no proposed changes to restrictions coming from that Transition Committee meeting,” he told reporters.
“However, I do emphasise that we are constantly looking at the level of restrictions that we have in place in South Australia, making sure that they’re commensurate with the risk.
“We know that it is a worrying risk just directly across our border.
“That group, the Transition Committee, is looking at issues like density, like home gatherings, churches, the fitness sector, borders and of course our aged care facilities. But no changes today.”
He said the ball was “very much … in the court” of businesses, organisations and the public “to do the right thing”.
“We are enjoying a very different situation from people across the border,” Mr Marshall said.
“Whether they be in Queensland, New South Wales and of course in Victoria. We want to keep as many people employed as possible but we really need to have this continuing good partnership with the people of our state and make sure we don’t become complacent in any way.”
There were two new cases reported in South Australia on Friday however the woman in her 20s and man in his 50s were both passengers on repatriation flights into Adelaide and are being managed in medi-hotel quarantine.
“I am not worried about these cases,” SA chief public health officer Professor Nicola Spurrier said.
There were no new cases reported in Queensland today, 11 in NSW and 450 in Victoria.

CURRENT ISSUES IN FOCUS
Mr Marshall met with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other state and territory leaders for National Cabinet on Friday.
He described aged care as “an area of joint concern” between the federal government and the South Australian public health administration.
“We will be looking at a range of issues, in particular multi-site employment,” Mr Marshall said.
“We’ll certainly be looking at that issue here in South Australia. And also, increasing the use of masks, maybe moving to that earlier rather than later.”
He said authorities were absolutely delighted with COVID-19 testing rates and also delighted with compliance checks on those in isolation.
But they did see “some complacency setting in” in some sites across the state including organisations and businesses that weren’t fully enacting their COVIDSafe plans.
“It’s fair to say we will take a very dim view of people who are not doing the right thing,” Mr Marshall said.

Prof Spurrier said 94 people including students of Thebarton Senior College were taken to medi-hotel quarantine on Thursday night and Friday due to their links to the Thebarton cluster which has grown to five cases.
Their families, considered casual contacts, have also been ordered to quarantine at home in what the chief public health officer described as a “double ring” around the chain of transmission.
“We are putting this additional requirement in place for anybody that’s been on the grounds,” she said.
“Whether that’s staff, students or visitors. They have to complete a 14-day quarantine period at home.”
The home quarantine will be enforced by police.

While businesses in the cities are relying on JobKeeper payments to keep people in work, growers in the bush say they have plenty of work available - but no-one to do it.
There is no shortage of work in the ­regions with fewer businesses in agricultural centres accessing government coronavirus payments, but farmers are struggling to find workers to pick crops amid COVID-19 restrictions — even at wages of $400 per day.
Ahead of The Daily Telegraph’s upcoming Bush Summit, NSW Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall said Australians should consider taking up a job on the farm as producers struggle to find overseas workers.
Sustained pressure from the citrus industry saw the NSW government last week relax the rules for seasonal workers living in Mildura coming into NSW to pick fruit.

“It’s very hard to get Australians to do that sort of work,” Mr Marshall said.
“I think it would be lovely if there was a change of mindset, but that‘s going to take a considerable amount of time.”
Daily Telegraph Rural Advisory Panel chairwoman Jillian Kilby said: “The Bush Summit will put this issue on the table but more importantly the Bush Summit will highlight the significant regional employment opportunities.”
Rural areas are less reliant on the government supplement than in the cities and tourist centres, an analysis of JobKeeper data has shown, with those in the regions also less likely to believe the benefit should be extended beyond September.
A Newgate Communications survey found people in the regions were less supportive of extending JobKeeper.
In metro areas, 62 per cent of people surveyed two weeks ago believed the supplement should continue beyond September, compared with 55 per cent in the regions.
“As the government scales back JobKeeper and Jobseeker, regional NSW is putting its hand up and saying ‘we have jobs available’,” Ms Kilby said.
Orchardist Guy Geata, who grows cherries outside of Orange, has seen inquiries for work drying up during the pandemic despite cherry pickers being able to earn around $400 a day.
“We need about 70 people in December, and I don’t know what we’re going to do,” he said, warning that if growers can’t find workers, Christmas fruit will be more expensive.
“It’s going to be left on the tree, they won’t taste as good, and the price is going to go up,” he said.

Health investigators have discovered COVID-19 parties are the source of new outbreaks where attendees try and catch the virus on purpose.
Health officials from Washington State in the US have reported that newly diagnosed cases of coronavirus caught the potentially deadly illness on purpose at “COVID-19 parties”.
Walla Walla County health officials say people diagnosed with coronavirus have told county investigators they attended parties specifically organised to spread coronavirus in recent weeks.
Megan Debolt, the director of community health for Walla Walla County, said one of the parties with at least 20 attendees has so far resulted in two positive cases of COVID-19.
Immunity parties, also called pox or flu parties, are sometimes organised so children can catch diseases such as chickenpox from one another and gain immunity to an illness.

The discovery has alarmed health officials, who have been scrambling to contain a large outbreak of coronavirus at a meat processing plant near Pasco which has seen more than 700 workers test positive.
Walla Walla county so far has 94 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the first of those infected sadly died this week, according to ABC4 KOMO News.
Ms Debolt said while investigating the cases the residents said, “Oh, we were having a COVID party.”
She said the county’s health officials are now tracing the contacts of all those who attended the party.
“It’s all of their contacts – up to 25 contacts per person is around 100 people that could have potentially been exposed,” she said on Wednesday.

Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have dismissed the effectiveness of immunity parties similar to pox parties, warning that COVID-19 is up to 100 times more deadly than chickenpox.
“Some have entertained the idea of ‘controlled voluntary infection’, akin to the ‘chickenpox parties’ of the 1980s. However, COVID-19 is 100 times more lethal than the chickenpox,” David Dowdy, from the University’s Department of Epidemiology, wrote.
Prof Dowdy said that someone who goes to a COVID-19 party “would not only be substantially increasing their own chance of dying in the next month, they would also be putting their families and friends at risk”.
Coronavirus is currently the leading cause of death in the United States, killing thousands of Americans every day. Currently, there have been over 1.26 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US and more than 74,000 people have died.
According to the University, at its peak chickenpox never killed more than 150 Americans a year.
Ms Debolt said the two confirmed cases have since expressed remorse after learning they’d endangered their friends and family.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/atlassian-cofounder-mike-cannonbrookes-lashes-out-at-swedish-covid19-approach/news-story/1b494388fa48b517f920fc56f3db1278
One of Australia’s richest men has lashed out at Sweden’s controversial approach to the pandemic, calling a rise in cases “scary”.
One of Australia’s most successful entrepreneurs has lashed out at Sweden’s much-discussed coronavirus response labelling a recent second wave of cases in the Scandinavian nation as “scary”.
In a tweet this morning, Mike Cannon-Brookes, the founder of Australian IT giant Atlassian, criticised Sweden’s approach which avoided mandated lockdowns and kept bars and shops open even during the early days of the pandemic when much of the world was in hibernation.
Mr Cannon-Brookes, who according to the BRW Rich List is Australia’s fifth wealthiest person with a net worth of almost $10 billion, uploaded a graph from website Our World in Data which showed Sweden’s confirmed new cases per million people exceeding those of the US.
“Next time anyone tells you Australia should have followed Sweden’s approach … they just passed the USA for cases/capita and that’s (sadly) a very scary curve,” he wrote.
Mr Cannon-Brookes added that Australians “(special shout out to Victorians!)” should be congratulated for a “huge, brilliant team effort” in keeping COVID-19 under control.

RELATED: Jury’s out on Sweden’s virus management
Advocates of its more hands-off approach have argued it could provide lessons on how to handle the pandemic while letting life go on as close to normal as possible. But critics have said a huge wave of deaths and rising cases, far higher than its neighbours, have proved the country made the wrong decisions on combating the virus.
Pubs, most schools and other workplaces have remained open throughout the pandemic. When people in Sydney were banned from supping a beer in a bar, residents of Stockholm were enjoying sundowners with their mates.
RELATED: Melbourne crushes world virus record
That’s not to say there were no restrictions on the nation’s 10 million citizens. People were barred from going to aged care homes, joining large gatherings and Swedes were encouraged to socially distance and work from home – which it seems they did almost as much as everyone else.
Initially at least, the “nudge” approach championed by Sweden’s chief epidemiologist Dr Anders Tegnell appeared to backfire. At one point, Sweden had more deaths per population than any other country.
Its overall number of deaths – at around 6000 – is a lower than many countries, but also far exceeds its neighbour Norway which has only seen 300 people die.
The vast majority of Sweden’s deaths occurred in the early months of the pandemic after the virus got into the aged care system.
Sweden’s death rate puts it as the 18th worst hit country with 59.78 fatalities per 100,000 people, with Belgium, Spain, Brazil, the UK, US, France and Italy worse off according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

LITTLE SIGN OF HERD IMMUNITY
Swedish officials have always denied there a herd immunity strategy in place. But, if there was, a recent rise in cases suggests that strategy failed.
From a daily average of around 200 cases from August to September, coronavirus cases in Sweden have begun to soar.
Yesterday, 4000 Swedes were diagnosed with COVID-19. The relaxed attitude of early 2020 also seems to have waned.
The Swedish government has proposed banning the sale of alcohol in pubs and restaurants after 10pm, after Prime Minister Stefan Lofven suggested people were not observing social distancing recommendations.
The ruling would mean venues would have to close at 10.30pm, after stopping the sale of alcoholic drinks half an hour beforehand.
“Unfortunately it also seems like we are moving towards darker times when it comes to the spread of infection in parts of the world, in Europe and here in Sweden,” Mr Lofven said on Wednesday. “All indications are now going in the wrong direction.”
The Prime Minister also warned the people of Sweden he was prepared to take more drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country.
DEATHS REMAIN LOW
However, as some people replied to Mr Canon-Brookes’ tweet, by another measure Sweden is still tracking far better than earlier in 2020 – deaths.
Fatalities reached a high point of 115 per day in mid-April. For the past three months deaths have been around two per day. The seven-day rolling average went up to 13 deaths a day last week but has since fallen under 10.
RELATED: What Australia will look like by Christmas
It’s a trajectory mirrored elsewhere. Deaths in the US are continuing to rise, but a second wave of cases has not been mirrored in a similarly sized rise in fatalities.
Nonetheless, some states have warned the sheer number of cases means hospitals are beginning to fill up.
It’s possible that as younger people are now becoming infected, they may be more successful at fighting the virus or, as the virus is better understood, treatments may be more effective.
In August, Dr Tegnell said it could be some time before Sweden’s approach was either vindicated or rejected.
“It will be very difficult to achieve any kind of really clear-cut answer as to what was right and what was wrong,” he told UK newspaper The Observer.
“I think we’re talking years into the future before we can get any kind of consensus on how to deal with this in the best possible way.”

Viral coronavirus fragments have been detected in wastewater from a Victorian town, with residents and visitors urged to get tested.

Queenslanders have been put on alert after sewerage testing uncovered positive coronavirus results in three different areas.
Queensland’s chief health officer has raised concerns about undetected coronavirus cases in the community after testing at three wastewater plants returned positive results.
Sewerage testing at Maroochydore, on the Sunshine Coast, and Wynnum and Sandgate wastewater plants in greater Brisbane came after all three had previously returned negative results.
The news of the coronavirus fragments in sewerage come as Queensland recorded no new cases overnight and has just four that are across the state.
Dr Jeanette Young said on Saturday there was no need for alarm although there was every chance someone may have coronavirus and not even realise it.
The positive tests could also be the result of people having recovered from COVID-19 but are still shedding virus fragments that is turning up sewage.
“We now have three positives down here in the southeast corner,” Ms Young said.
“They are on the back of four weeks of negative tests in those three locations. So there is something happening.
“It could be someone who‘s recently had the infection, and then has gone to those places, so they’re not infectious … but they’re still shedding virus.
“It could of course be a person that we’ve not picked up that is out there in the community.”
Ms Young said it was extensive sewerage testing in Victoria and NSW that resulted in more positive coronavirus cases being uncovered.
She said that could very much be the same scenario in Queensland following the latest sewerage outcomes.
“We have most recently seen, in both Victoria and New South Wales, that when they‘ve had positive results in this sewerage, they’ve gone out then and done more testing, and they have found cases,” she said.
“That could be happening here in Queensland.
“So, now that it’s now over a month since we’ve had an infectious case in the community, we could have an infectious case again, any day.
She said the state had the resources to manage any outbreak so long as they new cases were detected immediately.
“As long as we find those cases as soon as we can. That is absolutely critical,” she said.
Ms Young also but ruled out a Queensland woman, who tested positive to coronavirus after arriving in Victoria recently, of having contracted the illness in Sunshine State.
The Townsville woman, aged in her 30s, had flown to Cairns and Brisbane, then to Victoria on October 7.
“We managed to test some blood that was taken from that person just before they left Queensland, and that test was negative for COVID-19 neurology,” Ms Young said.
“It just suggests that she didn’t have the infection while she was in Queensland. ”

Customers looking to get a burger or fast food fix will notice a change across McDonald’s stores in NSW, as the state tries to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Employees at McDonald’s stores across New South Wales must now wear a face mask during their shifts.
A spokesman for McDonald’s told NCA NewsWire the measures were prompted by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urging people working in hospitality or retail to wear a mask.
“All employees are required to wear gloves and serve our customers from behind plastic screens at the front counter and drive-through window to prevent the potential for any direct contact,” the spokesman said.
“The health and safety of our people and customers has always been our priority and McDonald’s remains committed to following the Government’s guidance.”
Employees will be supplied with three-ply surgical masks suitable for kitchen use, and that meet government standards.
Appropriate training will also be provided to all employees.
“McDonald’s has established health and safety procedures for the use of masks in our restaurants and appropriate training will be provided to all employees,” the spokesman said.
“McDonald’s also has strict social distancing procedures in place throughout its restaurants, including the front counter, drive-through window and kitchen areas.
“Every day, in every shift, our employees are also following strict cleaning, sanitisation, quality control and hygiene procedures.”
McDonald's Australia CEO Andrew Gregory told 2GB the fast-food giant needs to take responsibility.
“It’s the right thing to do,” he said.
“We’ve got adequate supplies of masks and we have been working to make sure of that.”
McDonald's workers in Melbourne were told to wear a face mask last month when cases of COVID-19 were just beginning to surge in the state.

A top medical official says Australians must get used to "disruptive and intrusive" measures for "at least" the next six months.
Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has warned Australians will be facing COVID-19 for the long haul, saying we should expect “disruptive and intrusive” measures for at least six months.
"People who say we can lockdown the country for four weeks and send everyone home, close the schools, are not being realistic," he told A Current Affair this evening. “At the end of those four weeks, you have to undo all that, and then the virus can break out in a more aggressive way.
"We are trying to get the community adjusted to the fact that this is a long haul,” he said, adding that Australians would have to “change the way we behave”.
He said forcing people to stay home was a “possibility in the future” in sections if a small part of the country experienced a “very significant” outbreak.

Warnings have been issued for more than 180,000 Sydney residents after COVID-19 fragments were found at a major sewage treatment plant.
COVID-19 fragments found in one of Sydney’s major sewage treatment plants has caused concern among healths officials, prompting calls for residents to go and get tested immediately.
Traces of the virus were found at a facility in Liverpool, which takes in a catchment of close to 180,000 people.
It has sparked fresh fears that the virus is circulating undetected within the community.

The plant services dozens of suburbs and NSW Health has warned people in these areas to be on very high alert.
“NSW Health urges everyone living or working in these suburbs to monitor for symptoms and get tested and isolate immediately if they appear,” NSW Health said.
The suburbs include:
• Bardia
• Hinchinbrook
• Hoxton Park
• Abbotsbury• Ingleburn

The warning came as NSW recorded no new locally acquired COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
The state has now recorded nine days in a row of no community transmission. There were two cases detected in overseas travellers in hotel quarantine.
However, there were just 7800 tests conducted yesterday and health officials are concerned about the rapid drop in testing rates.
“The drop in testing numbers is a concern,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“Although NSW has had nine days without a diagnosed locally acquired case of COVID-19, the virus may still be circulating in the community and now is not the time to drop our guard.”
Viral coronavirus fragments have been detected in wastewater from a Victorian town, with residents and visitors urged to get tested.

Nothing the COVID-19 crisis can throw at jockey Alysha Collett can compare to what she has overcome to be riding and that’s why you can expect her to have an immediate impact at Queanbeyan.
Under normal circumstances, Alysha Collett would be riding at Kranji in Singapore on Sunday.
Instead, she will be at Queanbeyan having her first ride in Australia since competing in the Group 1 ATC Metropolitan Handicap in 2018.
Collett, the sister of Tatt’s Tiara winning jockey Jason, is one of a handful of jockeys who chose to come to Australia when Singapore racing shutdown due to the COVID-19 crisis.
‘’I have been up in Singapore all-up for about two years but the COVID-19 situation has made it a bit sticky for us, so I thought I would come back and make the best of the opportunities here,’’ Collett said.

“I flew in from Singapore three weeks ago and did two weeks in isolation. It was very boring, I would recommend it for nobody, but it’s saving people so it’s a good thing to do.
“I couldn’t really do much because you’re stuck inside the whole time so I was reading, doing lot of exercising and watching TV series. I watched a lot of racing from all around the world, so you get to catch up on things.’’
Collett is no stranger to Sydney racing, she won a scholarship that entitled her to spent two weeks working for Chris Waller for whom she rode a winner for at Rosehill in 2013 as an eighteen-year-old apprentice.
Nothing the COVID-19 crisis can throw at Collett can compare to what she has overcome to be riding anywhere.
A horror race fall in Singapore in 2018 left her with a broken back requiring surgery on her spine which put her on the sidelines for the best part of a year.
Since them, it’s been onward and upwards for the 25-year-old who has embraced all the Singapore has to offer — even the heat.
“It’s 30 degrees all the time,’’ she laughed.

****************************
‘’It’s an amazing lifestyle up there. You are only racing a couple of times a week so it is very laid-back. It is completely different to here but it is nice to be here to get the challenge of riding every day.’’
It’s no coincidence that Collett’s two rides at her first visit to Queanbeyan — Aradhana and Fight The Knead — are both for Clare Cunningham who is the partner of her brother Jason.
‘’I am looking forward to riding them. I know them both now. I have had a little bit of a ride on them. I’ve been lucky that Clare has given my the opportunity to ride them out there.
“I know it is a little bit of a hike but I’ll take that,’’ she said.
Collett, like her brother, is a Group 1 winning jockey thanks to her partnership with iron-mare Consensus who won the Zabeel Classic at Ellerslie on Australia day in 2016.
And like Collett, Consensus has a famous racing pedigree – her fourth dam is none other than Surround who is the only three filly to have a Cox Plate.

INSIDE MAIL WITH SHAYNE O’CASS: QUEANBEYAN
RACE 1
Looks potentially a race in two between the first starts Proud Mia and Delacour both from the nation’s capital. Proud Mia is trained by Nick Olive and is a half sister to the exceptionally fast Spaceboy and she seems to have inherited a lot of her sibling’s speed running 53 flat in her trial. Delacour likewise won her trial by a big space. She was a bit slow out but mustered big time to win. Very racey type and a dead-ringer for her sire Magic Albert. Skaifee is best of the others.
Bet: Proud Mia win, exacta 10 to beat 6
RACE 2
Alsyha Collett is back in NSW via New Zealand and Singapore given the COVID-19 crisis. This is her first time to Queanbeyan and she could very well come away with two winners from her two rides both for Clare Cunningham. Collett rides Aradhana here, a filly who has placed at three of her four starts and who has been runner-up in her two Queanbeyan visits. One Last Fight is a superbly bred Snitzel/Kylikwong filly having her first run for new trainer Joe Cleary. Hey Dugee has trialled well – twice.
Bet: Aradhana win, box trifecta 1,4,7,8
RACE 3
Acton Shale has always shown some talent but there can be no doubt that Nick Olive trained gelding has really hit his straps of late. The son of Hinchinbrook was runner-up at Canberra on April 24 which set the scene for his powerful 1200m win at Wagga last Sunday. Plum Pudding is a cleverly named daughter of mare called Christmas who chased a handy type home at Moruya last time. Hard Core has raced here at home seven times for two wins and four placings.
Bet: Acton Shale win, Plum Pudding place, exacta 6 to beat 8
RACE 4
Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott would surely like to think they can get this one with The First Ring. He’s not the best horse to ever walk out of Tulloch Lodge but this is a wafer thin race even by maiden standards. Call Me Artie is yet to place in four runs but his last start fourth was good enough to see him medal in this affair. Patrick Scorse ride Physcoa is a chance but he’s got a wide draw to contend with. Ruler Of All is a player.
Bet: The First Ring win, box trifecta 1,4,10,11
RACE 5
Norm Gardner has his one-time TAB Highway winner Upper House is grand order right now. The son of Zariz has won two of his past three starts and was a close up fourth at the other in the Albury Mile. He won his last start with 62kgs on a heavy track and he’s no Rough Habit! So You Think son Bart (named after Bart Cummings) races best here at home with two wins and a third from four goes at the track. Boys Day Out has won nine races and placed 14 times.
Bet: Upper House win
RACE 6
Fight The Knead is Alysha’s Collett second ride on the card for Clare Cunningham and will take beating. The mare seems to be building to another win now after a couple of eye-catching placings at Canberra then Muswellbrook on May 1 when she was beaten a whisker. Greg Hickman trained Kareno has only win once in 14 starts but she has placed six times and was second at her only previous trip to Queanbeyan. Congenial Mistress and Future Dreams should run well.
Bet: Fight The Knead win, exacta 8 to beat 10
RACE 7
Natalie Jarvis has found the key to former Godolphin galloper Kattegat. The Black Caviar relation has won both times under her management in the most emphatic style. Gets harder to keep winning of course going up in class and weight – not to mention a horrible draw today – but he’s flying. Judge’s Daughter has raced well every time Gary Nickson has brought her here. Shady Diamond likewise has some affinity with the circuit.
Bet: Kattegat win, box trifecta 1,3,7,9
INSIDE MAIL WITH ADAM SHERRY: PARKES
RACE 1
One Pound settled well back and was checked on the corner in finishing third to the smart Shamusu Sho at Narromine April 27. Ridden up on the speed from wide draw and blitzed her rivals by five lengths at Dubbo May 3. Hard to beat again. Twilight Sun lost all momentum when held as he was looking to make his run at Canberra last start. Should have finished much closer that fifth. Clever Missile and Carnegie’s Monaco are capable.
BET: ONE POUND TO WIN.
RACE 2
Fancythatmo was little slow out and settled back midfield when fifth at Sapphire Coast in October before a spell. Jumped well and led when resuming at Goulburn May 8 to finish second behind Nuremburg Castle. Drops in weight and that can make the difference. Mas Dinero debuts for new stable after racing in Queensland. Form up north is handy should be kept safe. Ay Bee Are has trialled nice ahead of his return here.
BET: FANCYTHATMO TO WIN.
RACE 3
Lateral Missile was trapped wide and over raced a touch but boxed on gamely to hold down third at Goulburn last Friday. Nicely drawn and will give a bold sight. Stablemate Akela’s Charm tried hard behind the promising Any Wish at Kembla last Thursday. The form was fracked with Any Wish winning again at Taree on Tuesday. Polished Penny is knocking on the door for a win after placings at her past three starts. Jetline was a good second first-up and rates well.
BET: LATERAL MISSILE EACH-WAY.
RACE 4
Testing Times finished her last campaign on a high note and can kick off this preparation the same way. She won her first trial back at Warwick Farm April 17 before a third to handy stablemate Shock Alert at their home track April 27. Perfectly drawn to take up a forward spot and looks tough to beat. Powerscourt is racing consistently around Wagga and Canberra. Will be right in the finish.
BET: TESTING TIMES TO WIN.
RACE 5
After scoring at her second start at Kemble, Zem Factor then stepped up to midweek company. She was far from disgraced when fourth to Aquataine at Kensington before a sixth to All Cylinders at Canterbury in January. That’s strong form for a race like this. Now with Mack Griffith and she has trialled well recently. Supergaze was a handy fourth on debut at Orange before winning at Narromine last start. Costas and Irresistible Girl are not with a chance.
BET: ZEM EM TO WIN.
RACE 6
Good Time Charlie got the job dome albeit narrowly from Shehroz when resuming at Narromine April 27. Only had the one trial going into to run and should be further improved. Gold Touch is resuming from a break but rated highly on her last start win from Sausedge at Canberra Feb 21. Stablemate Festival Of Light and Rogue Runner have been racing in good form and ran the quinella at Dubbo last start. Will be right in the thick of things again.
BET: GOOD TIME CHARLIE TO WIN.
RACE 7
It’s been three years since Generalissimo last won but he has spent of that time on the sidelines. Found the distance of his recent starts too short but has been working to the line reasonably well under big weights. Step up to the mile suits and will appreciate a big drop in weight. Assault’n’bathory scored a crushing all-the-way win at Canberra last start and is the one to beat. Steamin’ was good at Canterbury last start when fourth to Come Along. Has been set for this.
BET: GENERALISSIMO EACH-WAY.
RACE 8
Ginger’s Voice came from back in the field when third at Orange April 17 before leading all-the-way to score a big win from Jetline at Dubbo two weeks ago. A repeat of that effort will see her hard to beat again. Patrick May wasn’t an easy ride when by laying in resuming at Wellington. Better effort last start when third to Rawson Crossing at Narromine April 27. Nieces And Nephews is better than his last start failure at Wagga May 1.
BET: GINGER’S VOICE TO WIN.

Beachgoers were seen ignoring COVID-19 social distancing rules at Coogee, in Sydney, on April 22, after beaches in the Randwick City Council area were reopened. Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly beaches were opened up to the public on April 20 for the purpose of exercise only, the local council said. They had been closed for several weeks after a spike in local cases of the virus and previous incidents of people overcrowding the beaches. Strict social-distancing rules remained in place for beachgoers, who were required to stay at least 1.5 metres apart and to leave the area when not exercising. This video shows people walking close to each other and gathering on the sand and promenade. Credit: @jenasdad via Storyful

A nurse who was “feeling better” after having COVID-19 took a turn at home and called an ambo for help. But paramedics made a shock discovery.
A hero nurse who was sick with coronavirus called an ambulance for help, helpfully leaving her front door open – but tragically she was already dead when paramedics arrived.
Rebecca Mack, 29, is the 14th frontline health worker in the UK who has been killed by the virus after dying at home on Sunday, The Sun reports.
Her heartbroken mum Marion has now revealed Rebecca had told her and dad Alan she was “feeling better” at around 6pm the night she died.
When she failed to reply to a message at 10pm, Marion assumed she had gone to sleep — not knowing her daughter had taken a turn for the worse.
Rebecca had called paramedics and left the front door open, but by the time they arrived, she was already dead.
Marion told Chronicle Live: “It’s just horrendous. We can’t even go to see her to say goodbye.
“She was an absolutely wonderful daughter. We couldn’t have wished for a nicer daughter. She was so caring.
“She was just the light of our lives. I can’t even begin to imagine life without her.”
Rebecca had worked as a children’s nurse at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary before more recently taking a job with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS).
Marion said her daughter had dreamt of being a nurse since she was little, adding: “She was amazing, she had a gift.”
The devastated mum also revealed Rebecca had been “so excited” with plans to buy a house and get a dog.
She is now pleading with everyone to follow government advice and stay indoors.
“You think you are going to be safe, but I think this virus is a lot more contagious than anyone realised. It’s indiscriminate. I don’t want any other parents to go through what we are going through at the moment,” she said.
“It is totally mind-blowing the support we have received, I knew she was brilliant but you realise how many people she touched and how much of a difference she made.
“That makes me so proud to know that is our daughter.”
Tributes have since poured in for the dedicated child cancer nurse.
“She was honest, warm and charismatic. She worked hard and made her family proud every single day,” Sarah Bredin-Kemp, one of Rebecca’s best friends, wrote on Facebook:
She knew her worth and never settled for less and wouldn’t let her friends settle either.
“She was so proud of her work and so happy to have such amazing work friends.”
Rebecca’s colleague Jamie Young also took to social media, saying he had been left heartbroken.
“Today, the NHS lost an absolutely amazing and beautiful nurse, myself and my colleagues lost the most tremendous clinician. At the age of just 29, she had her entire life ahead of her,” he said.
The tragic death of Rebecca comes as the UK death toll from coronavirus on Wednesday climbed to more than 6000 with more than 51,000 cases.
Another tragic loss reported was nurse Barbara Moore who worked at the Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool before contracting the deadly virus.
“Barbara’s loss is an awful blow to us all, and she will be missed so much by all of her colleagues,” said Dianne Brown, chief nurse of Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
“I have offered our sincere condolences and our support to her family at this time of their sad loss.
“Barbara was a patient discharge planner, which is one of our unsung hero roles.”
She continued: “Barbara’s dedication to helping patients get safely out of hospital meant that people returned to their loved ones as soon and as simply as possible.
“She will be terribly missed.”
It’s the second blow for the Aintree University hospital workforce after 68-year-old staff nurse Liz Glanister died on Friday.

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard confirmed four men, aged between their 60s and 90s, have died due to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 overnight, with three of the four deaths linked to the ill-fated Ruby Princess.

The deaths bring the state’s death toll to 16.

A 91-year-old man, an 80-year-old man, a 76-year-old man and a 61-year-old man died overnight while 39 people are in the ICU with 23 are on ventilators.

Minister Hazard warned 26 per cent of cases involve people under the age of 29.

“Out of the 2,580 cases that we have in New South Wales at the moment, there are 565 people under the age of 29. That's 26 per cent, that's about quarter of all the cases in New South Wales are people under 29,” he said.

"There's 105 cases of under 19. Take it seriously is my message to young people. Take it very seriously."

Brisbane Lions could return to Queensland straight after their match against the Giants to serve the rest of their quarantine period.
The Brisbane Lions are bracing themselves to leave NSW straight after Saturday’s match against GWS Giants rather than serve the remainder of a quarantine period in Sydney until Friday week.
In the Round 8 draw released by the AFL on Monday night, the Lions are scheduled to play Melbourne at Gold Coast venue Metricon Stadium on Sunday week.
Currently based in Sydney, the Lions meet GWS at Giants Stadium at 1.45pm on Saturday.
It will be their second successive match in the NSW capital, having been beaten by Geelong last Thursday night at the SCG.
Because they played against Victorian opposition in the Cats, the Lions have to serve a two-week quarantine period before being permitted to move freely in Queensland.
RELATED: Charlie happy in the Lions’ den
The most likely scenario remains for them to serve their entire quarantine time in Sydney before returning home on Friday week, two days before their meeting with the Demons.
However, with a second wave of COVID-19 feared for NSW, the Lions have been told by the AFL they might be forced to leave Sydney immediately after their meeting with the Giants.
While the Lions players would be able to train in Brisbane next week while in quarantine should they return home, their wives, partners and children would be unable to attend work and school, having come into contact with team members.
The AFL and the NSW Government have been in talks with how best to deal with the situation, with the Lions being kept abreast of the evolving situation.
It’s understood the Lions would prefer to spend next week in Sydney training before returning on the Friday.
However, they are at the mercy of COVID-19, the AFL and the NSW Government.
The Lions’ Sydney hotel and training venues are not located in the “coronavirus hot-spot” suburbs whose residents are now barred from freely crossing the NSW-Queensland border.
The Lions and the Demons are sharing the same hotel on Sydney’s northern beaches, with the Melbourne club having also moved to the NSW hub last week.
“I’m not sure when we even fly back to Queensland yet but I dare say we’ll be doing a little bit of our preparation in the same hotel, which is pretty funny,” said Lions star Lachie Neale, who also admitted he had not dwelled on COVID-19 cases rising in NSW.
“I haven’t thought about it too much. Guys like (football general manager) David Noble and (CEO) Greg Swann would be all over that stuff.
“I’m happy to stay here if that’s what needs be, but I’ll also be happy go home as well, so I’m just going with the flow at the moment trying to prepare for each game as a I (normally) would.
“As we know with the condensed season and the ladder’s so tight at the moment as well, it’s going to be a really tight finals race so every game’s super important.”

The race is on to find Queensland truckies and travellers who may have been exposed to COVID-19 while passing through a popular NSW pub as human vaccine trials start in Brisbane.
Health authorities are urgently trying to locate Queensland truckies who stopped at a NSW pub at the centre of the latest COVID-19 outbreak, as the first human trials for a vaccine get underway in Brisbane.
The movements of hundreds of people are being traced after staff and patrons of the Crossroads Hotel at Casula in Sydney’s south west, tested positive.
It comes as Queensland recorded a single case of coronavirus in the 24 hours to Monday morning.
A Sunshine Coast woman in her 30s who had recently returned from the United States is the latest person to contract the virus, taking the total number of cases to 1071, four of which remain active.
She is currently in hotel quarantine.
Deputy Premier and Health Minister Steven Miles said the unfolding situation at the NSW pub was of most concern.
“It is a stopping point for people travelling along the highway, especially truckies,” he said.
Mr Miles said Department of Transport and Main Roads staff on Sunday alerted trucking networks across the state of the cluster, while police are stopping people at the border.
“Anyone who has been to the Crossroads Hotel between the third and the 10th of July should go and get tested,” he said.
“This is a very large contact tracing exercise, probably one of the largest undertaken here in Australia.”RELATED: Virus shuts defence base
Meanwhile 120 volunteers from across Brisbane on Monday received the first dose of the University of Queensland’s trial COVID-19 vaccine.
Innovation Minister Kate Jones said more than 4000 people had offered to take part in the study.
“We asked Queenslanders to roll up their sleeves to save lives and they’ve answered the call in droves,” she said.
UQ Professor Paul Young said while there was no guarantee the trial would work, it was a promising step forward, with preliminary results expected in three months.
“The green light to move into this human trial follows extensive pre-clinical testing that the team has been conducting since first selecting the lead vaccine candidate on 14 February,” he said.
“This testing showed that the vaccine was effective in the lab in neutralising the virus and safe to give to humans.”RELATED: Hundreds fined for big mistake
UQ has also entered into a partnership with CSL to ensure any vaccine developed in Queensland will be developed and manufactured locally.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was “another win for Queensland and Australia”.

Chairman of Arrowfield Group John Messara says “nothing much changes” at the stud “except for the protocols” put in place to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.

“The horses still need tending to and feeding etcetera,” Mr Messara told Sky News.

Arrowfield Stud is situated near Scone in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales.

“We are managing how close we are to one another and how many are in a room,” he said.

“We are following the prime minister’s advice as best as we can.

“It’s working okay.”

Two special COVID-19 clinics have opened on the beaches for those most at risk of the disease, while those referred by GPs to private clinics say there’s a long wait list.
Northern Beaches Hospital has opened a COVID-19 clinic for those most at risk of having the disease.
Another clinic has also opened at Mona Vale Hospital.
On Tuesday afternoon patients at Northern Beaches Hospital were being met outside the front of the emergency department by a triage nurse decked in protective glasses, a mask, gloves and a disposal gown, before being escorted for testing if found to meet the criteria.
There had been a steady stream of people requesting tests all day, according to an observer with four waiting when the Manly Daily arrived.
In 15 minutes only one of the four seen was asked to don a mask and was taken for testing. The others were given a sheet of health information and sent away.
The current criteria for swabbing at emergency departments is strict and staff are only admitting those who have any symptoms of fever, cough, shortness breath, muscle aches, or chills, as well as having been or had close contact with someone who has been to mainland China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand, or been in contact with a confirmed or suspected case of coronavirus in the last 14 days.
Dr Caroline Rogers, a GP from Narrabeen said people had been swamping GP surgeries with requests for testing this week because many employers were telling them they could not come back to work unless they had a negative result for COVID-19.
Many of those don’t meet the emergency department criteria hence the long waiting list for test appointments at private pathology laboratories.
Dr Rogers said there was a lot of anxiety in the community.
“People are being cautious and are trying to do the right thing,” she said.
“I’ve heard people are having to wait a few days for a test and then a few more for the results.”
She said patients who had been to the new COVID-19 clinics had reported the system was efficient and they were in and out within a few hours.
In a Northern Beaches Hospital staff newsletter it said it was trialling the clinic as an extension of the emergency department: “People are advised to ring the ED intercom and they will be escorted to the clinic for testing to minimise any risk to other people waiting in ED”.
The newsletter also reassured staff that the hospital was operating as normal and it had high infection control standards.
One woman in her 30s was admitted with the coronavirus at Northern Beaches Hospital last week and has been isolated.
It is also understood a second person has also been admitted, although NSW Health was not able to confirm this at the time of publication.
A hospital source said the new $600m hospital was better designed than most for the fight against the coronavirus with more than 150 single rooms and up to 20 negative pressure isolation rooms, designed to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, as well as special rooms in intensive care.
“We have more single rooms than most hospitals, more isolation rooms and a low infection rate,” the source said.
Dr Rogers said there was some great advice online from Healthdirect and people could call the COVID-19 Hotline — 1800 020 080 — although some patients were reporting it was hard to get through.

The World Surf League has been one of the sports hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. It finally returns at one of the most famous breaks on the planet.
Surf’s up… finally.
After spending the year at home in Newcastle looking after his children, dirt biking, mountain biking and playing golf, Julian Wilson is returning to where he left off last year — competing at Pipeline.
The World Surf League has been one of the sports hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the return of the women’s competition at the Maui Pro this week and the men at Pipeline next week heralds a new beginning.

Wilson, 31, is feeling refreshed and eager to let rip after spending his enforced break in Merewether with wife Ashley and children Olivia, 2, and baby River, who was born in January.
“For this point in my career to get a year off and I had a new baby and to get this time at home and not be dragging the kids around the world was a pretty nice little break in the middle of my career,” Wilson said.
Starting the tour in Hawaii is a bit like relaunching a football season with the grand final, and Wilson is pumped.
“We normally end the year at Pipe, it’s probably the best event of the year I think and you’re at the mercy of the swell and whatever comes,” Wilson said.
“It can be either two foot or 15 foot, and you have to compete in all of it, so you got to be pretty open, fit and ready for anything but it’s the ultimate event I think (believe).”
Gabriel Medina and John John Florence are the world title favourites but Wilson is confident of his chances.
“I’ve been able to achieve a few things so far in my career but I’ve been really close to a world title but that is the real goal, the real motivator,” Wilson said.
“I mean at the moment I’m looking at going away for three months, away from the family and doing three events overseas so the driving force for all of that is to win a world title and make it worth it.”

Fox Sports will broadcast the WSL tour, where it’s available to watch on Foxtel and stream on Kayo.
“I know all my mates growing up love tuning in and watching what I’m doing so to be able to make it that accessible and that good to watch is key,” Wilson said.
“Surfing was one of the first sports to utilise streaming due to the fact that we have waiting periods and inconsistent swells, so it just needs to happen at the drop of a hat so to be able to stream it is key.”
The next 12 months will be jam-packed for Wilson, including competing alongside Owen Wright at the Olympics in Japan.
“It’ll be exciting,” Wilson said.
“Lots of airs, it will be a little bit like watching the US Open of surfing, but yeah to represent Australia which has been a huge part of my career, to know do that on the Olympic stage will be really exciting.”
The tour returns to Australia for the Rip Curl Pro at Bells Beach in April and wraps up in September at Trestles, California.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/rightwing-extremist-threat-spread-across-australia/news-story/0e74f760396dad18987c3ed934b0b805
Australia’s domestic spy agency says extremists have seized upon COVID-19, believing it reinforces conspiracies at the core of their ideologies.
Spy agency ASIO is ramping up its capacity to tackle right-wing extremism, which it says has spread across the country.
Up to 40 per cent of priority counter-terrorism investigations this year involved right-wing extremists.
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Director-General of Security Mike Burgess told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday it was “refocusing resources” on the threat.
“Right-wing extremists are more organised, sophisticated, ideological and active than previous years,” Mr Burgess said.
“Many of these groups and individuals have seized upon COVID-19 believing it reinforces the narrative and conspiracies at the core of their ideologies.
“They see the pandemic as proof of the failure of globalisation, multiculturalism and democracy, and confirmation that societal collapse and a race war are inevitable.”
However, another hearing was told that far right conspiracy theory QAnon did not have a “large” presence in Australia.
The Australian Federal Police also told senators its workload had increased as they tried to tackle the ongoing terrorism threat.
“What we see with right wing extremists and particularly the effect and the power of the internet, in terms of those sites, it’s apparent that it’s more spread throughout Australia,” Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney said.
“(What) continues to be our biggest threat is Islamic-inspired extremism.
“It’s predominantly historically been centred in Sydney and Melbourne, to a lesser extent in Brisbane.”
Mr Burgess also revealed he was writing to federal MPs to raise their attention about the threat of espionage attempts.
“The level of espionage and foreign interference is actually at an unprecedented level, an unacceptable level,” he said, adding it was higher at local and state government levels than federal.
He said the letter itself would offer practical tips on what to look for and how to handle it.

State Government officials have issued a public health warning after alarming reports of a new COVID-19 cluster at a Sydney pub.
THE Queensland Government has issued a public health warning after alarming reports of a new COVID-19 cluster at a south western Sydney pub.

Drivers stuck in traffic hell crossing Queensland border
Queensland records no new cases of COVID-19 overnight
Health Officials urged Queenslanders who visited the Crossroads Hotel in Casula between July 3 and July 10 to isolate and get tested immediately.
The alert, issued Sunday evening, came as four new cases were confirmed to have come from the Sydney pub, on top of five existing cases detected last week.
Health Minister Steven Miles said it was “very likely” that a number of Queenslanders were inside the pub during the period.
“The hotel is a busy stopover for many travellers – they should get tested as soon as possible and then immediately self-isolate” he said.
Some of the new cases at the pub include an 18-year-old staff member and a 50-year-old south Sydney woman, both of whom are close contacts.
It is understood more than 1600 patrons visited the pub while the 18-year-old was working, with none of the confirmed cases being believed to be the catalyst for the outbreak.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant had advised that anyone who attended the venue in any capacity in those seven days to isolate immediately.
“While investigations are continuing, it is vital people get tested so we can try and establish the source of infection at the hotel,” she said on Sunday.

The coronavirus lockdown has led to an “unprecedented demand” for designer dogs, with on-trend breeds like French bulldogs and cavoodles selling for at least $6000 each. LIST: MOST EXPENSIVE BREEDS
Massive demand for designer puppies has driven prices to more than double as people cooped up at home by COVID-19 crave companionship.
Wanted ads are clogging social media and classified ad sites, pleading for on-trend breeds like French bulldogs, cavoodles (cavalier King Charles spaniel cross poodle), ­moodles (Maltese cross Shih tzu) and cockaliers (cocker spaniel cross King Charles spaniel).
Pet shops have had to dramatically increase their prices, passing on breeders’ newly hefty charges.
Bondi Junction’s Room 4 Pets, said it had increased its prices of puppies to cater to “unprecedented demand”.
“(There are) so many people at home deciding the pet they’ve been thinking about for the last year or two, they should adopt right now,” a text to prospective dog owners from the store said.
“As a result, we are having to pay much higher prices to our breeders. Pups we were paying $1200 for two months, are now $3500.
Blacktown breeder and French bulldog enthusiast Jennifer Sturgeon said that the drive in demand is due to people working from home and their need for friendship and company.
“I think people really need the companionship at times like this, they’re cooped up inside and they don’t have a regular routine,” Ms Sturgeon said.
“Because of their nature dogs just make you feel happy and especially French bulldogs because they’re really good with the kids and I think that’s something that adds to their popularity. And they make you smile.”
Ms Sturgeon’s latest litter of French bulldogs sell for between $6000 to $8500, making the six cuties worth a potential $51,000.
A Dubbo based breeder is charging $49,000 for a litter of seven chocolate cocker spaniels, while another has listed a litter of cavoodles for $6500 each.
A breeder on Gumtree is charging $54,000 for a litter of six “pedigree fluffy longhaired French bulldogs”.
But there are growing concerns over a “pet surrender boom” post COVID-19.

Researchers have mapped the Aussie suburbs most at risk of COVID-19 job losses, with more than 12 per cent on “red alert” across the country.
The economic shock of the COVID-19 crisis has already caused job losses across the country.
But the worst is still yet to come.
Treasury is forecasting the unemployment rate to reach about 10 per cent, or 1.4 million unemployed, in the June quarter.
This 5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is expected to unfold over three months, compared to the three years it took the unemployment rate to rise by the same amount in the economic downturn of the 1990s.
Now researchers have mapped the areas most at risk across the country.
The Employment Vulnerability Index (EVI) uses Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data to calculate an index score for towns and cities with a population of more than 10,000 people.
RELATED: Graph points to ‘unprecedented’ Australian job collapse
RELATED:  How JobKeeper propped up employment figures
Co-authors Professor Scott Baum from Griffith University and Professor Bill Mitchell from University of Newcastle combined previous EVI data and insights on the jobs most affected by an economic downturn to model COVID-19’s impact on more than 80 per cent of Australians.
They found the state with the most “high risk” areas was Tasmania at 34.92 per cent, followed by South Australia at 22.22 per cent.
Overall, 12.64 per cent of the country is in the high risk category.
The researchers placed areas into two groups - those that have existing disadvantage and those that have emerging disadvantage.
Those on “red alert” - having a high potential for job loss - in areas with existing disadvantage include Punchbowl in Sydney’s south west, Broadmeadows, north west of Melbourne, Beenleigh in Queensland, Elizabeth in South Australia, Girrawheen in WA and , Glenorchy in Tasmania.
Those in the emerging disadvantage category include Green Valley (NSW), Epping South (NSW), Sunnybank (Qld), Salisbury East (SA), Greenfields (WA) and Brighton-Pontville (Tas).

Professor Baum said the two groups raised different issues for policy makers.
“For the group we call ‘existing disadvantage job-loss suburbs’, further labour market disadvantage will cement the social and economic malaise experienced by these communities and widen the gap with rest of the nation,” he said.
He said the outcomes were different for the second “emerging disadvantaged job loss” group, as some workers would transition with the economy, while others may not be so lucky.
“The challenges may include household and community burdens associated with increasing localised financial hardship or increases in a range of social problems seen in places that have been disadvantaged over a longer term,” he said.
“How deep and long these potential impacts will be is a matter of wait and see.”
RELATED:  Fallout from big budget blowout
The paper highlights how places in our capital cities such as Cabramatta in Sydney, Broadmeadows in Melbourne and Elizabeth in Adelaide will, if confronted by increasing job losses as a result of the current economic environment, be further pushed from the mainstream as disadvantage becomes more difficult to escape.
“For unemployed people living in these places, economic growth and progress at the national level may mean little if concentrated disadvantage means that their local communities get left further behind,” the authors write.
“For many of the already disadvantaged red alert suburbs in our nation’s metropolitan cities, geographic proximity to both affluent inner city and aspiring outer suburban localities means concentrated disadvantage has the potential to breed a host of social problems as residents witness first-hand feelings of being left behind.”
Professor Mitchell warns that withdrawing government support after the crisis is over will undo any positive outcomes.
“There is a real danger that the government will retract its support mechanisms too soon,” he said.
“Ultimately how these suburbs and localities fare will depend on the impact of the Federal Government’s economic rescue package and the depth of the economic downturn. Outcomes may not be as bad as some have predicted.”

Older Australians must be cautious about visitors at home despite COVID-19 restrictions being eased in some states and territories this weekend, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has warned adding that those over 70 were still at greater risk.
Older Australians have been told to be cautious about having people to their homes despite COVID-19 restrictions being eased in some states and territories this weekend.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said people over 70 remain at greater risk of the virus.
“For people over the age of 70 I just would say be cautious over these next couple of weeks, even if things are opening up and people are gathering in shops and cafes,” Prof Kelly said.
“I would just urge caution about your own health and consider … having people over to your house.”

Speaking ahead of Mother’s Day, Prof Kelly also warned elderly mums to continue to keep 1.5 metres away from loved ones.
“If you’re feeling well and you really want to see your mum, I’m sure that’s fine but for the elderly mums just to be a little bit cautious and probably keep that 1.5 meters distance.”
“I know it’s hard and we will want to cuddle our mums on Mother’s Day … but let’s just wait a little bit longer.”
Prof Kelly said Australia’s “new normal” may not be the same as life before the pandemic hinting that overseas travel and mass gatherings are “too far in the future” for the National Cabinet to consider.
“The third step is not quite back to normal as it was before COVID-19, and I think we’ve been quite open about this from the beginning that the new normal, the COVID safe normal for Australia, may not be the normal that we’re used to prior to January of this year.”
“For example, the opening of the borders to international travel, that’s so far into the future we aren’t really sure how that might actually happen yet.” He also said he was “doubtful” football fans would pack sporting ground in September for football finals.
TRIBUTES FOR GREAT GRAN WHO DIED AFTER BEATING COVID-19
A 17th resident of Sydney’s Newmarch House previously diagnosed with COVID-19 has died, taking the state toll to 47 and the national toll to 98.
It came as NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard revealed there had been five new cases of the virus reported in the past 24 hours.
Great grandmother Fay Rendoth, 92, died on Friday, her family said in a statement.
Anglicare Sydney said in a statement: “Tragically a resident of Newmarch House passed away last night. The family and all relevant authorities have been contacted.
“We are devastated at the passing and extend our deepest sympathies to the family as they grieve the loss of their loved one.”
The western Sydney nursing home is to appoint an independent adviser after it was put on notice by the aged care watchdog following the fatal outbreak at the facility.
Mr Hazzard urged those travelling to see their mums to celebrate Mother’s Day tomorrow to continue practising social distancing measures to protect their loved ones.
“Tomorrow keep your mum safe, when you go to visit your mum, do what we have asked you to do which is keep that social distancing,” he said. “I know it’s tough, it’s really tough to not be able to hug your mum kiss your mum, but it would be the wisest course do not do that.”
NSW residents have come out in massive numbers to be tested for coronavirus, with the five latest positive cases found from almost 14,000 tests in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
The huge spike in tests means 294,949 people have now been tested across the state with the total number of positive results rising to 3051.
PM’s PLAN TO REVIVE 850,000 JOBS – BUT NSW STILL SHUT
While Australia is on the road to freedom with hopes even pubs will be open by July, NSW remains locked up with Gladys Berejiklian failing to outline any new exit strategy for the state.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday unveiled a detailed three-phase plan to revitalise the economy and bring the country back to life, promising 850,000 jobs would be “restored” by July — 280,000 of them in NSW.
Other state and territory leaders immediately seized on this to outline how they would tackle the ambitious task of rebooting their states.
The NSW Premier provided zero insights although it is understood the state may move as early as next week on stage one restriction relaxations — but regional travel is likely to be excluded.
Residents in other states were given clear insights into how their future would look with Canberrans told that 10 people can gather in the ACT from today, Queenslanders assured they can travel 150km for recreation next week and Victorians promised a full plan on Monday.
Following national Cabinet on Friday, a cautious Ms Berejiklian released a brief statement repeating her earlier remarks that there would be “no further changes to restrictions in NSW this week”.
“NSW will continue to keep our citizens updated on our path forward,” the statement said.
Ms Berejiklian wants to closely examine the data showing the virus impact of earlier decisions including the May 1 move to allow home visits before finalising the timing of our next move, it is understood.
However the Premier may move next week and she is likely to come under pressure from fellow MPs and even cabinet colleagues who believe the state must keep up with the rest of the country to arrest the economic decline.
Before Friday’s meeting, Ms Berejiklian had wanted to wait until June to begin the next stage of lifting restrictions. But while other states had clear detail, in NSW on Friday night there was none.
Labor shadow health minister Ryan Park slammed the government’s lack of transparency.
“It’s making it very difficult for the community and business to understand what the hell is going on,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian claimed on Friday NSW had already eased a “number” of restrictions in the first stage of the plan — but the majority of the measures listed by the federal government as being the first frontier to tackle are still prohibited. These include five visitors to homes, and libraries and playgrounds reopening.
It is understood the Prime Minister’s office hoped all state leaders would stand up to provide further clarity and specific rollout plans after the framework agreed to in the mid-morning national Cabinet meeting had been announced.
In Queensland, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk released a detailed timeline for lifting restrictions down to the minutiae of outdoor gyms, nail salons and personal training sessions.
The federal government’s goal is to have Australia reach stage three by July, but with at least three weeks needed to review each step NSW could fall well behind if it does not start opening back up soon.
Economists said the Prime Minister’s bullish jobs target, produced by Treasury, was in line with a new “faster recovery” scenario published separately by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday.
Mr Morrison was so optimistic about the outlook on Friday he declined to rule out winding down the JobKeeper wage subsidy and the super-sized JobSeeker payment ahead of the current September schedule.
“People don’t want to be on JobKeeper and JobSeeker,” he said. “They want to be in a job that’s paying them. And that’s … what this plan is about.”
Under stage one of the national plan, skateparks, playgrounds and outdoor gyms will be reopened but limited to 10 people, and cafes and restaurants will be permitted to have up to 10 seated inside. The majority of people will continue to work from home.
Stage two will allow larger gatherings up to 20 people, including in settings such as cinemas, galleries, gyms and beauty parlours. Organised community sport will also restart.
Stage three allows gatherings of up to 100 people with most people expected to be back in the workplace and interstate travel to resume. Pubs, clubs and possibly gaming venues will be considered for restricted reopening.
Mr Morrison said while the July completion date was an “aspiration” the pace would be “totally up to the states and territories”.
“They’ll be responsible for setting their own timetable and communicating that to their citizens and residents in their own states and territories,” he said.

Radio shock-jock Alan Jones is used to courting controversy – but his latest comments about COVID-19 could be putting people at risk.
Radio shock-jock Alan Jones apparently believes the response to COVID-19 is nothing but overblown hysteria and alarmism. Clearly, the virus didn’t get the memo.
“In this modern world, at the slightest provocation it seems, we revert — despite all the money spent on education — we revert to hysteria and alarmism,” he said on radio this week. “We now seem to be facing the health version of global warming. Exaggeration in almost everything. Certainly in description, and certainly in behaviour.”
It may be a reassuring message. After all, he is preaching to his converted.
But he’s reading from a script already abandoned by his ultraconservative media brothers-in-arms in the United States.
At the weekend, many right-wing commentators suddenly adopted a very different tone.
And it doesn’t mesh at all with what they’d been pushing in recent weeks.
They had been downplaying it, insisting it was no worse than the flu.
They had been depicting it as a left-wing conspiracy to topple Trump.
They had been accusing medical groups and opposition media of “mass hysteria” and of being “panic pushers”.
Then, on Friday, President Trump declared the virus a national emergency.
Now, their message is … different.
And Jones, it seems, is out of step.

ALTERNATE TRUTHS
Jones said: “Unless I’m moving in different circles, the almost universal reaction I am getting is that we have gone mad.”
It certainly appeared the 2GB talking head occupied a different dimension.
His message contrasted starkly to that broadcast by those in the know – Australia’s public health experts. The ones trained in the job. With actual experience.
The 78-year-old, himself in isolation to protect his multimillion-dollar business, insisted most people would get a “mild illness”.
That’s sort-of correct. Most recovered sufferers don’t call it “mild”. But Jones’ understanding of viral contagion didn’t extend so far as to accept even a mildly ill person could infect someone far, far more susceptible. Such as his mostly elderly audience.
The raw, indisputable numbers reveal 15 per cent of those over 80 with the virus will die.
Jones’ on-air tirade came as Victoria, the ACT and South Australia declared public health emergencies. Even the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, had advised against non-essential gatherings of over 500 people.
Now, Jones’ handlers at 2GB appear to have been rattled by the public backlash.
There have been calls on social media to have him sacked for his “dangerous”, “irresponsible” behaviour.
“I'm not sure downplaying a serious threat is the correct approach when many of his listeners are seniors. Get him off the air,” one listener commented.
Commentator Mike Carlton labelled his comments “dangerous” and “reckless”.
Writer Brett Debritz suggested it was “time for Channel 9 to shut him down”.
He’s now been compelled to issue something of a clarification.
In it, he blames “the media” for being “alarmist”.
“I worry about my listeners … Our job in the media is to inform, to advise and not alarm and I think the media in all of this have done a very poor job,” he says. “The fact that people are fighting over toilet paper indicates the deep sense of alarm.”
He went on to repeat that eight of 10 cases will be mild. This time, however, he embraced the bigger picture: “But what is critical is those at greater risk, older Australians and those who are more vulnerable, particularly those with pre-existing conditions … it is a far more serious virus, and that is our concern.”
He did not address his other assertions.
Jones will himself be fine.
He will be broadcasting in isolation from his Fitzroy Falls home for the duration.

REALITY QUAKE
It’s complicated. Coronavirus doesn’t respond to gaslighting. Spin doesn’t divert its all-consuming desire to reproduce. Marketing doesn’t manipulate its behaviour.
So, COVID-19’s single-minded reality marches ahead regardless.
Case in point: US cable news’ most-watched figure, Sean Hannity.
“So far in the United States, there’s been around 30 deaths, most of which came from one nursing home in the state of Washington,” he said last week. “Healthy people, generally, 99 per cent recover very fast, even if they contract it.”
None of this conformed to US health department analysis.
Commentator Laura Ingraham, whose show goes to air immediately after Hannity’s, went so far as to say: “The public in some ways seems a lot more level-headed than the so-called experts. The facts are actually pretty reassuring, but you’d never know it watching all this stuff.”
But prime-time right-wing talking head Tucker Carlson stepped out on a limb. His message was at odds with all his colleagues.
“People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimising what is clearly a very serious problem,” he said. “It’s just partisan politics, they say. ‘Calm down. In the end, this is just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass, and when it does, we will feel foolish for worrying about it.’ That’s their position … But they’re wrong.”
Then, on Friday, his colleagues stepped through a portal into a new reality.
Hannity began by praising President Trump’s handling of … “the crisis”.
“Tonight, we are witnessing what will be a massive paradigm shift in the future of disease control and prevention,” he said. “A bold, new precedent is being set, the world will once again benefit greatly from America’s leadership … The federal government, state governments, private businesses, top hospitals all coming together, under the president’s leadership, to stem the tide of the coronavirus.”
Ingraham’s reality also changed. COVID19 news is now “sobering and scary to hear.”
But fellow Fox News talking head (with much lower ratings) Trish Regan didn’t adapt in time.
Last week, she accused an alleged Democrat-media alliance of “yet another attempt to impeach the president”. Amid a firestorm of public backlash, the Fox network declared her commentary show was suspended – indefinitely.

CASHING-IN ON CONSPIRACY
Mike Adams calls himself a “Health Ranger”. His anti-vax conspiracy theories and bogus cancer cures are all over the web. Every view triggers paying adverts.
His enticing message is one of doom and gloom: “It’s over for humanity,” he declares of COVID-19. “There will only be lone survivors. The strategy must now shift. You can be a survivor. We can help you survive, the information here at Infowars and what I do.”
We can be sure he’ll have something else to scare us about next year.
Such panic peddlers have a strong incentive to sell scares. Social media and internet advertising is geared to reward every click. And the more clicks a video or web-page gets, the more it is pushed into the faces of readers.
Which is why these stories keep changing.
One day, COVID-19 escaped a biological warfare lab. The next it’s a weapon aimed at overthrowing the Communist state.
With so many other Chinese diplomats retweeting or aping his conspiracy theories, it's starting to look less like an "outspoken" diplomat gone rogue, and more like a concerted strategy. https://t.co/pnvr7yOCvh
Public administrations are themselves increasingly eager to embrace the power of conspiracy. Beijing’s diplomats have started rebroadcasting claims of “illegal US biological experiments” in China. Not to mention the unsubstantiated idea COVID-19 was brought to Wuhan by a US soldier.
Every conspiracy theory is tailored to a different audience. For clicks.
For example: That the secret COVID-19 plan was “accidentally leaked” at Event 201, a World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supported the event. (The claim being it was all a plan for the billionaires to profit).
QAnon, the extreme right-wing conspiracy movement popular in Australia’s halls of power, claimed COVID-19 had been “patented” in 2015. But this refers to a study defining bird flu within the coronavirus family of viruses. Not COVID-19.
Alarmist stories sound fascinating: Was 5G responsible for mutating the virus? People are scared of the virus. People are afraid of 5G radio waves. But, scratch the surface, and you’ll discover such an event is actually against the laws of physics.

BELIEF VERSUS REALITY
Nonpartisan think-tank the RAND Corporation is worried about our post-truth world.
It wants to understand the power a good story holds over a democratic audience.
It has noted how facts and data are increasingly disputed in deliberate attempts to smother inconvenient truths. This is done through blurring the line between opinion and reality, ramping up the volume of a contrarian message, and emphasising the validity of one-or-two personal experiences over a more general assessment.
“Today’s level of disagreement over objective facts is a new phenomenon,” its Truth Decay report notes. “So how did we get here?”
It’s about exploiting human nature.
People automatically try to fit events into their personal world views. It’s called cognitive bias.
When people are presented with a challenge to their world view, they seek even irrational justification for their own. It’s called cognitive dissonance.
And they redouble their efforts to reaffirm their view: It’s called confirmation bias.
Mix with the rise of social media echo-chambers stressed education systems and political polarisation – and you get a fertile ground for conspiracy.
Global warming. Vaccines. Fluoridated water. Genetically modified food.
“Many well-educated people sincerely deny evidence-based conclusions on these matters,” writes professor of philosophy Adrian Bardon.
“In theory, resolving factual disputes should be relatively easy: Just present evidence of a strong expert consensus.”
And that’s true. Sometimes.
“But things don’t work that way when the scientific consensus presents a picture that threatens someone’s ideological worldview,” he says. “In practice, it turns out that one’s political, religious or ethnic identity quite effectively predicts one’s willingness to accept expertise on any given politicised issue.”
In such cases, people have a motive to reason irrationally.
RELATED: X-ray shows how coronavirus destroys lungs
RELATED: What are your chances of dying from coronavirus?
It’s not about ignorance, Prof Bardon argues. We’ve evolved to be stupid.
“Assimilation into one’s tribe required assimilation into the group’s ideological belief system,” he says. “An instinctive bias in favour of one’s “in-group” and its worldview is deeply ingrained in human psychology.”
But that all falls apart in a crisis.
“This picture is a bit grim because it suggests that facts alone have limited power to resolve politicised issues like climate change or immigration policy,” Prof Bardon says. “But properly understanding the phenomenon of denial is surely a crucial first step to addressing it.”

Proving you’ve had the COVID jab could be as simple as tapping your smartphone, under plans being finalised by the federal government.
Viral coronavirus fragments have been detected in wastewater from a Victorian town, with residents and visitors urged to get tested.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says this week will be “all about slowing the curve of the epidemic,” as the number of cases of COVID-19 in Australia rises to at least 300. 

It comes as the Australian death toll rose to five, after two people in New South Wales lost their lives overnight. 

Delivering an update on Monday, Mr Kelly warned while for many the virus is mild, the mortality rate in much older age groups is "quite high". 

“For people in the older age groups … they are more susceptible to this disease and we are finding,” he said. 

“Particularly in the much older age groups - 80 and above - that the death rate is actually quite high.

“What we're doing today, this week, and throughout our response to this epidemic in Australia, is trying to slow that curve so that we can manage those serious illnesses when and if they occur.”

After announcing a slew of harsh new restrictions across the state, Premier Gladys Berejiklian has made a thinly-veiled jab at Victoria’s strategy.
After a tense briefing on Saturday morning, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian delivered some very confident words about the state’s coronavirus strategy.
“New South Wales has proven to be one of the best places anywhere on the planet in relation to contact tracing, and in relation to the health advice we have been given,” Ms Berejiklian boasted during the hotly-anticipated press conference.
“The science of a pandemic is far from perfect. We don’t pretend that the settings we have put in place are entirely consistent or entirely consistent with what people would expect.
“But that is the nature of a pandemic. What we do know is what works.”
Her remarks were perceived by some to be a thinly-veiled dig at the Victorian strategy of handling their second wave, which saw locals and businesses in hard lockdown for just under three months.
RELATED:  Follow for all the latest coronavirus updates
During the briefing, the Premier reiterated that she would not tolerate the imposition of harsher-than-necessary restrictions in NSW, taking another potential jab at Victoria’s second wave strategy.
“We would never impose anything on our citizens unless we thought it was necessary,” Ms Berejiklian noted.
“The strategy very much in New South Wales is not to impose any burden on our citizens unless it is absolutely necessary but also to make sure we keep jobs and the economy, mental health, wellbeing, and a sense of normality moving forward as well as, of course, controlling the virus. And that is the balance we have always tried to strike in New South Wales. I’m incredibly proud of that.”
RELATED:  The one thing that saved ‘Dictator Dan’
Ms Berejiklian’s cocky remarks come after NSW recorded a further seven locally acquired cases of coronavirus overnight, prompting a change in current restrictions.
Despite the low increase, Ms Berejiklian insisted masks will be made mandatory in the Greater Sydney area from midnight on Saturday.
Masks will be compulsory for public and shared transportation and indoor venues such as shops, cinemas and salons, with a $200 fine in place for not complying.
“We’ve been talking about this for months and months,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“The reason it’s happening now is we want to give confidence to business to continue their activity in NSW so long as you wear a mask in those indoor settings.”
NFL fans will look to the Super Bowl LV for some star-studded relief. This is what Aussies can expect and how they can watch it.
As the US records more than 5000 COVID deaths in a day, the grim reality is the virus will be around for many years to come.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/more-people-are-at-risk-of-falling-severely-ill-to-covid19/news-story/55b5c883a8d19c07a9463e7854ba55cb
One of the world’s peak bodies on diseases has updated its list of individuals at an increased risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19.
The list of people at risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19 has been expanded by US-based Centers for Disease and Control (CDC).
While older adults and people with underlying medical conditions remain at risk, the institute has now changed the way it refers to age and related risk.
According to a statement from CDC, the organisation has removed the specific age threshold and now warns, for adults, the chances increase steadily with age, meaning it is not just people older than 65 who are at an increased risk for severe illness.
“Understanding who is most at risk for severe illness helps people make the best decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities,” CDC director Robert Redfield said in a statement.
“While we are all at risk for COVID-19, we need to be aware of who is susceptible to severe complications so that we take appropriate measures to protect their health and wellbeing.”
Age may be an independent risk factor for severe illness, but risk in older adults is also in related to the increased likelihood that individuals within this age bracket also have underlying medical conditions.
The Australian Department of Health’s guidelines state the risk of serious illness from coronavirus increases if you are: aged 70 years or older, aged 65 years or over and have a chronic medical condition, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person aged 50 years and over who has a chronic medical condition, or if you are immune suppressed.
An underlying medical condition can range from having a heart condition, to type two diabetes and being in an immunocompromised state.
CDC also clarified the list of other conditions that might increase a person’s risk of severe illness, including asthma, high blood pressure, neurological conditions such as dementia, cerebrovascular disease such as stroke, and pregnancy.
New research from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found pregnant women were significantly more likely to be hospitalised or admitted to intensive care. But pregnant women were not at greater risk for death from COVID-19.
But the The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said pregnant women “do not appear to be more severely unwell if they develop COVID-19 infection than the general population” and instead are more likely to experience moderate cold or flu symptoms.
“However, detailed information regarding the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women and their babies is limited by the recency of the disease emergence. Therefore, our pregnancy advice is based on learnings from influenza infection, and also the medical response to the SARS epidemic in 2003,” a statement from the organisation read.
In a statement obtained by NCA NewsWire, the Department of Health said it was reviewing the advice and guidance for people at risk of severe illness and would update its website accordingly.
“There is currently no specific advice on the risk for pregnant women but this is also under review,” the department said.
Pregnant women who have concerns in relation to COVID-19 should seek advice from their antenatal care provider.”

A female doctor who worked at Nepean Hospital and Sydney Adventist Hospital has tested positive to COVID-19. The NSW death toll has risen to 36, following the death of an 82-year-old man who resided at the Newmarch House aged care home.
A female doctor working at Nepean Hospital has tested positive to COVID-19 but had not been working with patients in the 48 hours before she started showing symptoms, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed.
She also worked at Sydney Adventist Hospital before she was diagnosed but also did not have contact with patients at that facility.
Eight staff members at the hospital — and mix of medical and non-medical staff — have been isolated as a precaution but none are yet showing any symptoms.
Mr Hazzard said today 3002 people across NSW have contracted COVID-19 since the pandemic begun, with eight new cases recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm Saturday.
Mr Hazzard said 2208 people have now recovered from COVID-19.

The 600 medicines now in short supply
An 82-year-old man from the Newmarch House aged care facility was the sole fatality from the virus in NSW is the 24 hours to 8pm Saturday.
A spokeswoman from Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District, who this morning confirmed the doctor’s positive test, said she had worn a mask at work and did not work when unwell.
“There is no ongoing risk to patients or staff and no impact on our services,” the spokeswoman said.
“Health screening is carried out on all staff at the start of each shift.
“The healthcare worker was undertaking non-clinical duties during this time.”
The spokeswoman said the doctor had recognised the first sign of symptoms and immediately got tested at a COVID-19 clinic.
The worker’s contacts are being traced and contacted with two from Nepean Hospital and a further eight staff at Sydney Adventist Hospital placed in isolation as a precaution.
“For privacy protection, no further details associated with contact tracing or testing will be provided,” the health authority said.
This state’s COVID-19 death toll now stands at 36 after a sixth resident died at the aged care home in Caddens, near Penrith, where almost 50 people have been infected.
The 82-year-old man died on Saturday morning, operator Anglicare Sydney said.
This follows the death of a 96-year-old woman on Friday morning, a woman in her late 70s on Thursday and earlier fatalities of a woman and two men all aged in their 90s bringing the total death connected with the facility to six.
The facility is the state’s largest ongoing cluster, with some 31 of the almost 100 residents having been infected as well as 17 staff members.
An aged care worker at the healthcare facility in the Blue Mountains also tested positive for coronavirus, one of 12 new cases confirmed in NSW on Saturday.
NSW Health said no other positive cases had been confirmed at the facility.
NEW CORONAVIRUS APP TO LAUNCH
The controversial app to help trace people who come into contact with someone with COVID-19 will be launched on Sunday.
The Australian app is based on Singapore’s Tracetogether software, which records the Bluetooth connections a phone makes with others so the user can give that data to state health authorities if they catch the virus.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who has recovered from a bout of COVID-19, said it was a more effective approach than checking your diary or trying to remember where you had been.
“The beauty of the app is that it can have a handshake, if you like, with people that you’ve been in close proximity with, find the phone,” he told Sky Sunday Agenda.
He said the privacy issues had been dealt with, and said the app would help the authorities stop the spread of the virus.
“It’s an incredibly important next step.”
A broader testing regime and a government contact tracing app are seen as key stepping stones to a relaxation of the economic shutdown.
The government wants at least 40 per cent of the population to sign up so officials can do “industrial-scale” contact tracing.

A 15-year-old girl has been accused of breaching COVID-19 rules after she allegedly spat in a police officer’s face at a Sydney shopping centre.
A 15-year-old girl has been accused of breaching a COVID-19 direction after she allegedly spat at police at a shopping centre in western Sydney.
Officers spoke with the teenager in Blacktown about 2.30pm on Friday and “ascertained she was in breach of her bail conditions”.
“As police arrested the girl, it is alleged she assaulted police by kicking and punching, as well as spitting in the face of an officer,” NSW Police said in a statement on Friday.
Nine reports the incident occurred at Westpoint shopping centre.
The teenager was taken to Blacktown Police Station and charged with two counts of assaulting police in execution of duty, resisting an officer in execution of duty and not complying with a noticed direction “re spitting/coughing – COVID-19”.

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard made the public health order back on April 9.
“The object of this order is to deal with the public health risk of COVID-19 and its possible consequences by giving a Ministerial direction about intentionally spitting at or coughing on public officials in a way that is reasonably likely to cause fear about the spread of COVID-19,” it states.
The offence carries a fine of $5000 or is punishable in court with a maximum penalty of six months behind bars and/or a fine up to $11,000.
The 15-year-old was refused police bail was due to face a children’s court on Friday.
TWO WOMEN ISSUED $1000 FINES
Two women were separately issued $1000 Penalty Infringement Notices in NSW on Thursday after allegedly breaching public health orders.
Police said a 31-year-old woman coming from Victoria was stopped at a border checkpoint in Albury last Saturday.
She listed a Nimbin address on her entry permit, in northern NSW, where she was to self-isolate for 14 days.
However, she didn’t go and stay at the property.
Police instead found her 470 kilometres away on Thursday in a vehicle at Nabiac on the state’s mid north coast.
She was issued with the $1000 fine for not complying with a noticed direction and was also instructed to return to Victoria.
Meanwhile, a 50-year-old woman playing a gaming machine at a licensed venue in Albury at 1pm yesterday was spoken to by patrolling police.
“The woman produced a Victorian licence and a permit allowing cross-border travel for work purposes only,” police said.
“She was issued with a $1000 PIN and removed from the club, to return to Victoria.”

Theatre nurse Souraya Farah has been working long hours to meet the demand at Sydney’s pop-up COVID-19 testing clinics. But she is happy to do it for the good of the community and that’s why she has been nominated for the Thanks a Million campaign.
COVID-testing clinics have found themselves inundated with anxious Sydneysiders in the past few weeks.
Theatre nurse Souraya Farah has been testing people in clinics across Western Sydney since the beginning of the virus but recently was faced with a “never-ending line of cars”.
Ms Farah was testing at the Ash Road Sporting Complex pop-up clinic in Prestons, only six kilometres from the hotspot of Casula.
“On Monday and Tuesday I couldn’t see the end of the line all day and we had people waiting up to six hours,” Miss Farah told The Sunday Telegraph.
“We closed at 6pm and we had to turn a line of cars away to be tested at other sites.”
The Prestons testing centre experienced a decrease in testing demand on Thursday and Friday and six coronavirus testing clinics are set to close this weekend in southwestern Sydney.
“Friday has been steadier, we still have people queuing in the line but we’re getting everyone through,” she said.
Ms Farah has worked in a number of testing clinics in Western Sydney since March including Narellan, Camden, Bankstown, Fairfield and Cabramatta.
The frontline health worker said she has been working longer hours in the last couple of weeks due to higher demand for testing but is “happy to give the time and look after the community”.
“I guess you just have to take on the challenge, whatever is required from you to keep everyone safe,” Miss Farah said.
Sorcha Thorton, 26, has been working at the Bondi pop-up clinic, which has tested more than 20,000 people since April.
“From Thursday onwards we had anybody coming in to get tested, symptomatic or asymptomatic,” Ms Thorton told The Sunday Telegraph.
“We get a lot of people that are quite anxious but we’re just there to reassure them and educate them during such an uncertain time.”
The two women have been nominated for News Corp Australia’s Thanks a Million campaign, which honours those who have put their safety and lives on the line keeping us safe.
The campaign invites readers to show their gratitude to anyone — from retail to teachers and posties, to a kind next door neighbour — whose work and community spirit has helped keep Australia going through savage bushfires and now the coronavirus pandemic.
Published across all News Corp Australia state-based, regional and community news titles — the campaign will culminate in a national digital honour wall on News Corp Australia websites, with names also published in printed newspapers across the country.

The pattern emerging in virus clusters in VIC and NSW will be worrying for authorities, given what we know about who is at risk of severe COVID-19.
A toddler and an aged care worker are among  the latest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NSW in a worrying sign for officials.
Australia recorded its highest ever day for coronavirus cases on Wednesday with 484 in Victoria alone, more than in the whole of the UK, which saw 445 confirmed positive lab tests.
Of those, a significant portion were found to be in aged care and health facilities.
In Victoria some of the key outbreaks listed by the state’s health department include 69 cases linked to St Basil’s Homes for the Aged in Fawkner. Another 54 cases have been tied to Estia Health in Ardeer, while 37 cases have been linked to Glendale Aged Care facility in Werribee and 30 come from Arcare Aged Care in Craigieburn. Another 61 cases have been linked to Sommerville Retail Services in Tottenham with 47 cases linked to JBS in Brooklyn.
In NSW, 16 new cases were confirmed on Wednesday with three major clusters linked to Victorian strains of the disease. One of the most recent includes a toddler at the Good Start Anna Bay child care  childcare centre in Port Stephens amid fears a cluster is developing in the town. A staff member at a Sydney Inner West aged care facility also tested positive to COVID-19 after dining at the Thai Rock restaurant.
Sydney Local Health district said the risk for residents at Ashfield Baptist Homes is low because the  worker wore wore masks, gloves and gowns but staff and residents are being tested.
“The risk to other staff and residents is considered to be very low as the staff member wore masks, gloves and gowns when working with residents and did not work while symptomatic,” a statement from Sydney Local Health District said.
“Ashfield Baptist Homes is closed to all visitors pending test results.”

The Australian health department website states that while every individual is different, those who are more likely to suffer severe illness from COVID-19 include those aged over 70, who have had organ transplants, bone marrow transplants or any kind of cancer treatment. In addition to that, smoking, age, being male and poverty also increases risk of contracting a severe version of the virus.
It comes as Melbourne hospitals order in new stocks of ventilators to boost capacity to save the most critical patients.
The Herald Sun reports Royal Melbourne Hospital received 22 new ventilators this week and will boost intensive care capacity by around one third.
Meanwhile The Courier Mail reports Queensland borders could clamp shut again with Sydney potentially declared a virus hotspot by police in the state if cases continue to rise.
“There is no way that more hot spots are not going to be declared, and all of Sydney would definitely be a consideration given what’s happening down there,” a senior police source told the publication.
“If the situation continues to deteriorate over the next week, I honestly don’t see how we wouldn’t look at closing the border entirely.”

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/coronavirus/hibernation/easy-ways-to-take-part-in-plastic-free-july-as-rubbish-piles-up-during-lockdown/news-story/ca26d7d0928981f8749248f80362af2a
Waste is piling up as Australians spend more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Which is why now is the perfect time to embrace a plastic-free lifestyle. And it’s not as hard as you think.
A change in household habits during the pandemic has shown it is impossible for families to avoid plastic.
The extra time at home has meant more rubbish piling up in their bins, with a rise in food delivery and takeaway packaging, biscuit wrappers, pasta and bread bags, paper towel and toilet paper packaging, plastic bags and single-use gloves.
Waste from Australian households has risen more than 10 per cent since lockdown, according to the Australian Council of Recycling, with many families throwing the wrong things in their recycling bins, especially soft plastics, leading to unprecedented levels of contamination.
But breaking free from normal routines — whether by skipping the bottled water, cooking at home more or shopping at supermarkets — can present an opportunity for families to contribute to a cleaner environment and more sustainable future.
Parents and owners of the Cornersmith cafe, Alex Elliott-Howery and James Grant, have embraced plastic-free as a fun challenge for their kids.
Whether it’s growing their own vegetables, collecting rubbish at the beach or buying eco-friendly items that aren’t wrapped in plastic.
“I gave up cling wrap a while ago and replaced it with beeswax wraps and containers,” Ms Elliott-Howery said.
“When we buy grains at the market, we take our own jars, and when I’m at the supermarket, I choose items that come in cardboard such as tea, oats and pasta.
“We’ve moved over to bamboo toothbrushes and deodorant that comes in recyclable tins, and during lockdown I started making homemade mouthwash and cleaning sprays. It only took five minutes.”
Kate Nelson, author of I Quit Plastics: And You Can Too, said reusable items are the best way to get into the plastic-free habit.
“It’s as simple as a water bottle, a coffee cup, a set of cutlery and a lunch box if you like to take leftovers home,” she said.
Ms Nelson suggests committing to remove one plastic item from your life at a time.
Opportunities range from buying fresh produce at local farmers’ markets and storing food in repurposed glass jars, to making body scrubs from coffee grounds and moisturiser with oils.
“It can also become a fun game for the whole family to get involved in,” Ms Nelson said. “Start a trash audit and keep all of the plastic you normally would throw away, like sauce packets, wrappers, sticky bottles and takeaway boxes.
“This will help identify what plastics you need to eliminate from your life and design a strategy for phasing these out. If you have tons of takeaway food containers, you may try to pack your own lunches or prepare some meals for the week to come to avoid the temptation of ordering out.”
The plastic habit is a lifestyle pledge being shared by more consumers horrified by the tens of millions of plastic products created worldwide each year, much of it in the form of single-use items like straws, that end up in landfills or, worse, oceans.
In its 10th year, the Plastic Free July movement is making a comeback to urge people to reduce single-use plastic waste every day at home, work and their local supermarket.
Founder Rebecca Prince-Ruiz said the majority of participants who refused at least one single-use plastic ended up creating long-term habits.
“Simple swaps could include switching to bar soap or avoiding plastic when you buy your vegetables,” she said.

When virus cases linked to a Sydney pub grew, customers were told to lock down and get tested. But does a change in advice mean NSW has given up?
As COVID-19 cases linked to a cluster at Sydney’s Crossroads Hotel steadily increased over the weekend, NSW Health was swift to put its foot down and issue urgent advice to any customers who’d visited the venue.
There are now 21 coronavirus infections linked to the Casula pub, with NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant telling reporters today that the race was on to find “patient zero”.
“Investigations are ongoing as to the source,” Dr Chant said.
“It is very important we investigate this thoroughly, before disclosing what we think is the origins.”
Sydneysiders who had been to the pub between July 3 and 10 were asked to self-isolate for 14 days and present for testing, with the outbreak marking a “critical point” in the future of NSW’s fight against coronavirus.
How the cluster is handled will no doubt signal whether we’re still moving toward eradicating COVID-19 like Australia’s other states and territories, or heading down the same path as Victoria – where another 177 infections were reported yesterday and Premier Daniel Andrews threatened a stage four lockdown if things aren’t brought under control.
But as venues linked to new infections in NSW emerged on Monday, a turnaround in the public health advice to patrons could signal the state is waving the white flag in the face of a second coronavirus wave.

At least four Sydney pubs and clubs have been linked to positive coronavirus cases, sparking fears of further community transmission, and Dr Chant revealed at least 10 venues where people who were later found to be infected with COVID-19 had visited in late June and early July.
But while the Crossroads Hotel patrons were told to enter lockdown by not only NSW Health, but Australia’s deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth, anyone who might have attended these newly-identified venues has been issued with far less urgent advice.
Rather than being confined to their homes for 14 days, these residents have merely been asked to watch for any coronavirus symptoms while going about their daily business over the next fortnight – leaving the future of NSW being in control of coronavirus on shaky ground.
“And if they (symptoms) occur to isolate and get tested from COVID right away so we’re not actually asking people to isolate themselves,” Dr Chant said.
“The interviews have highlighted that either the individuals were unlikely to be infectious at these times, or the nature of the contact at these venues was minimal, but we do want to highlight these settings and ensure that people are appropriately isolating.”
It comes as The Australian reports senior NSW Government ministers argued for advocating keeping the economy open rather than returning to a widespread lockdown as Victoria has done.
The newspaper said economic recovery was uppermost in the minds of Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Deputy Premier John Barilaro and Treasurer Dominic Perrottet in a meeting late on Monday night.
The NSW premier is set to announce a crackdown on pub numbers today, reverting to restrictions on group bookings to 10 people and larger venues restricted to 300 patrons.

Australians have returned to congregating, hugging and kissing as if coronavirus is a thing of the past, suffering from what experts have dubbed “social distancing fatigue”.
“It was always a risk,” Deakin University chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett said.
“I think we’ve seen what people are calling social distancing fatigue. There’s still a lot doing the right thing but it doesn’t take many to relax their guard to get this local transmission.”
This “fatigue” has been made clear by the current situation in Victoria, Professor Bennett said, and further prevention of COVID-19’s spread will rely on precautions at venues in other states potentially tightening to keep people in line.
“It gets very hard to stay on top of it,” she said, adding while the situation is not yet “explosive”, clearly “something” has gone wrong in NSW.
“The two things now that are going to make the difference is firstly testing, timing and co-operating, but fundamentally keeping up the personal distance, sneeze watching and hand washing.”
RELATED: All the Sydney venues on high alert
But NSW residents aren’t the only ones who can’t afford to become complacent, Australian Medical Association (AMA) NSW President Danielle McMullen pointed out, with a consistent approach from authorities integral to the state’s success.
“The recent resurgence of coronavirus cases in Victoria has shown just how easily it can slip through gaps in infection control measures,” Dr McMullen said last Wednesday.
“The pandemic isn’t over just because NSW had initial success in containing COVID-19.
“We’re still amongst it and, unfortunately, we don’t know when it will end.
“As the Premier has said, what’s happened in Victoria could happen anywhere in Australia and we still need to be adhering to social distancing rules.
“It’s everyone’s responsibility to help NSW contain the spread of coronavirus and maintain that suppression.”

Donated goods were delivered to public housing estates in Melbourne, Victoria, on July 6 after residents were placed under lockdown by the state government due to an outbreak of COVID-19. Bags of goods were dropped at the doorstep of one of the locked-down estates in the Melbourne suburb of Flemington by people including the former Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. Residents have received two weeks of rent relief and each household is eligible for hardship payments of up to $1500. There were 127 new cases of coronavirus in Victoria on July 6, according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. On July 6, the neighbouring state of New South Wales announced it would be closing its border with Victoria in response to the increase in cases over the previous week.

A 76-year-old Newmarch House aged care resident, who twice tested negative for coronavirus, has died of the disease and two more people linked to the facility have tested positive. The sad news comes as NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard announces daily COVID-19 testing of all of staff at the centre will soon begin.
An aged care resident who twice tested negative for coronavirus at plagued Newmarch House has died of the disease, bringing the death toll to 14.
The sad news has emerged this morning, as families beg managers of the facility to let them take their relatives home.
Ann Fahey, 76, died at 4.05pm at Nepean Hospital in Penrith on Saturday.
Her family said she had twice tested negative to the virus before falling gravely ill.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant this morning revealed families of residents who were COVID-19 negative could apply to remove them from the home but they would have to first endure a 14-day quarantine at a hospital ward or family residence.
Delivering an update on the NSW coronavirus situation at midday today, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state had a total of 3,035 cases with 2,306 people recovered. Four new cases were diagnosed in NSW yesterday, when 7,234 people were tested — a record high for a Saturday.
In regard to Newmarch House, Mr Hazzard announced daily testing of staff entering Newmarch House would soon begin, following advice on this matter from health experts.
He said this was a measure which was not available in the past but was possible now.
“It’s not a good thing to be blaming people who are on the front line doing their best, so if we can support those people in any way we will.”
“(Testing to this degree) has never happened before in any aged care facility. Right now we’re in a better space to be able to do that. We have more available testing equipment.”
“What the infectious disease specialists on the ground are saying is that they have done everything short of this and (since) we have the capacity to do this, we might as well have a go.”
He said investigators were looking into whether the virus had spread within the centre or from community sources outside the centre.
“I think Anglicare have taken the advice of medical staff and done what they can. My only issue with Anglicare is around communication, that there were families outside saying they weren’t getting information,” he said.
He said he could not comment on reports that the family of Ms Fahey had tried three times to remove her from Newmarch House and had not been able to.
Dr Chant said medical experts were currently looking at many scenarios in regards to improving the situation at Newmarch House, including moving the well people out or the sick people out.
On the broader NSW situation, she said there are currently 106 people being treated by NSW Health for coronavirus. Of these, 14 were in intensive care and 11 were on ventilators. One quarter of the cases were non-acute.
INSIDE NEWMARCH HOUSE
Anthony Bowe’s mother Patricia, 76, has battled the virus for 16 days and has been waiting to test negative but he claimed staff were too busy to get round to her.
“My mother is over the worst, we are desperate to get her out, as soon as a staff member gets round to testing her negative the first thing I will do is get it her out of there,” he said.
“Why would you leave anyone who is healthy in that home when the managers are clearly struggling to get the virus under control there?
“Over the weekend there were three new cases and people keep dying.
“The managers keep saying there is a long incubation period but three cases over the weekend which included staff is nothing to do with incubation.
“Something is wrong at that home. What they doing isn’t working, I want my mum out.”
Ms Fahey is the 14th resident of Anglicare’s Newmarch House in Caddens, near Penrith, to die after testing positive to coronavirus, after a carer inadvertently worked five days at the home while infected.

Ms Fahey is believed to have returned two negative test results before the third confirmed she had contracted the virus.
Her death comes as an investigation is launched into whether there has been a breach of infection control methods at the 102-resident facility.
A total of 61 people — 24 staff and 37 residents — have now tested positive for COVID-19.
Anglicare said it was “deeply saddened” that another resident had died and announced control specialists had been deployed to oversee the control of the infection.
“This is a very sad time for the family and a distressing and challenging time for residents and staff as we deal with the impact of this dreadful virus. It is so highly infectious,” Anglicare Sydney CEO Grant Millard said in a statement.
“In addition, 26 staff have tested positive and as a consequence 63 have been in self isolation.
“The carers who we discovered were infected on Friday were experienced with infectious disease situations which indicates just how contagious this virus is and how difficult to contain.”
Alternative accommodation options for people who are COVID-19 negative are being discussed with some residents and their families.
“Of course this is possible, provided there is a good understanding of the risks and precautionary measures that this would involve — for the resident and their families,” Mr Millard said.
NSW Health has deployed two infection control nurses to the facility to review its procedures.
“We’ve clearly seen transmission that on the surface looks like there’s been breaches of infection control amongst particularly the staff,” Dr Chant said.
“And that’s obviously a concern. There are have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred.”
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has defended the staff who had spread infection, saying dealing with the virus was “like almost going to the moon”.
But he conceded there had been breaches of health protocols.
“It only takes a moment. Our doctors are highly trained, but like everybody else you can make a mistake.”
Mr Millard said the use of personal protective equipment was foreign to a lot of people and acknowledged “there have been some failings” at the facility.
NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay called on the government to give all Newmarch House residents, even ones who were healthy, the option of being moved to the public hospital system.

WA Premier Mark McGowan has taken another dig at NSW’s response to the coronavirus pandemic when revealing his state's testing rates today.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has taken another dig at NSW’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic while praising the “amazing” record number of people in his state for getting tested.
Mr McGowan said more people were tested on the first day of lockdown in parts of WA this week than the day after the outbreak in Sydney’s Northern Beaches.
The total number of tests on Monday was 16,490.
“It was an incredible result,” Mr McGowan told reporters.
“Thank you to everyone who came forward and got tested. You’ve all done your state proud.
“To put that testing number into comparison, this is more than double the number of tests completed the day after the Northern Beaches outbreak in Sydney.”
NSW recorded 7531 tests on December 18 — the day after the Northern Beaches cluster was revealed.
But that number actually reflected tests processed in the 24 hours to 8pm the day before.

WA Premier Mark McGowan has reaffirmed his argument that NSW should “kill” COVID-19 rather than live with it.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has taken another swing at the NSW government for its handling of COVID-19, urging everyone in the state to “look outside” and see other jurisdictions have successfully “killed” the virus.
NSW officially recorded three new cases of coronavirus overnight, as well as two others after the daily cut-off, while WA continues to have a hard border in place for the “medium risk” state.
Comparing Queensland to NSW, Mr McGowan said it would be best to eliminate the virus from Australia.
“The idea that you tick along with the virus and somehow that is a better model is wrong,” Mr McGowan told reporters on Monday.
“I just urge the NSW government and people in NSW to look outside of NSW at what other states and territories are doing in order to crush and kill the virus.”
Queensland did not record any new local cases overnight and Mr McGowan said he was very pleased with how the state was going as it prepared to finish its three-day lockdown.
“It would have been no doubt debilitating and difficult, but they did the right thing,” he said.
“We need to eliminate the virus from Australia.
“It would be, I think, advisable if NSW eliminated the virus from Sydney and that would of course mean that we could rest a lot easier across Australia.”
Last week, WA shut its border to Queensland travellers after a hotel quarantine cleaner in Brisbane tested positive for the very contagious UK strain of COVID-19.
The Premier said he would await further health advice before considering when to reopen the border to Queensland travellers, noting Brisbane would have a further 10 days of restrictions.
“I wouldn’t expect we’d take any action before Queensland ensures they don’t have community spread of the virus, but at the end of that point in time we’ll get further health advice,” Mr McGowan said.
“Queensland doesn’t know if they’ve got community spread … and this is the British strain, which is highly contagious and obviously causing mass deaths across Britain.”
Asked if WA could reopen to Queensland after those 10 days if there were no new cases, rather than the usual 28 days, Mr McGowan said it would depend on the health advice.
WA also has a hard border in place with Victoria.

A new alert has been issued for a number of villages, a suburb and town 200km away from Sydney after virus traces were found in wastewater.
Thousands of residents on the NSW south coast have been urged to monitor for symptoms after fragments of COVID-19 were detected in the wastewater system at Ulladulla.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the catchment served a population of 32,000 people across Narrawallee, Milton, Mollymook Beach, Ulladulla, Kings Point, Burrill Lake, Dolphin Point and Lake Tabourie.
“I also want to alert the community to a sewage detection in the treatment plant at Ulladulla for the first time,” she told reporters on Friday.
“There have been no recently locally acquired cases … but this is a time of year when we have lots of mobility, we cannot exclude that someone who has the infection from either NSW, Victoria or a return to traveller from interstate, may have visited that area.”
Dr Chant said it could be the result of an old infection passing through the area.
However she urged residents in those towns, or anyone who may have visited during the last week, to come out for testing.
There were four new cases in NSW on Friday, including two linked to the Berala cluster.
One other is a household contact of the Croydon outbreak and one is a man on the northern beaches who’s infection has health authorities stumped.
He tested negative three times during his 14 day quarantine period, after he was confirmed as a close contact, but later tested positive.

Scott Morrison has weighed in on the COVID-19 vaccine debate, signalling tough new rules on international travellers who fly to Australia.
International travellers who fly to Australia without proof of a COVID-19 vaccination will be required to quarantine at their own expense.
That’s if they can get on a flight, after Qantas signalled anti-vaxxers will be banned from flying on their aircraft fleets.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison signalled the tough new rules on Melbourne’s Kiss FM radio on Wednesday.
“We’re obviously working through those issues now, but look, where people have the choice of two weeks of quarantine or being vaccinated, I think that will be an incentive, unless there’s a genuine medical reason why,” Mr Morrison said.
The cost of quarantine can run to several thousand dollars for the fortnight in a hotel, depending on what city you quarantine in.
“We’ve got a lot of those issues to work through and so do all the other countries,” Mr Morrison said.

Health Minister Greg Hunt has also hinted at the vaccination passport plan but stressed the policy was still under discussion.
“So there’s been no final decision, but we’ve been clear, and I’ve given guidance previously that we would expect that people coming to Australia while COVID-19 is a significant disease in the world will either be vaccinated or they will isolate. That’s early guidance,’’ he said.
“The likely course of events during 2021 is if somebody comes to Australia and a vaccine is widely available, either they’ll be vaccinated with verification or they’ll have to quarantine.”
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has signalled that proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be a non-negotiable condition of international air travel.
On Monday night, he told A Current Affair host Tracy Grimshaw that as soon as a vaccine becomes available it will be a condition of travel.
“For international travellers, we will ask people to have a vaccination before they get on the aircraft,’’ he said.
“Certainly, for international visitors coming out and people leaving the country we think that’s a necessity.”
If anti-vaxxers want to try alternative airlines, Mr Joyce predicted they won’t be travelling far.
“I think that’s going to be a common thing talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe,’’ he said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously suggested vaccination will be “as mandatory as you can possibly make it” before walking those comments back in recent months.
“There are always exemptions for any vaccine on medical grounds, but that should be the only basis,” he said in August.
But just hours later, Mr Morrison told listeners on Sydney radio station 2GB that the Government would not make vaccination mandatory.
“It’s not going to be compulsory to have the vaccine,” he said.
“I mean, we can’t hold someone down and make them take it.”
NSW health authorities have announced changes to their checks on returned travellers leaving hotel quarantine.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has enquired about an app that allows police to monitor people in self-isolation while announcing zero coronavirus cases overnight.
Queensland has again recorded no new coronavirus cases as Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk admits she is intrigued by a WA government app that allows police to check-in with those self-isolating at home.
The app will allow more home isolation and ease the demand on hotels with the number of international arrivals requiring quarantine set to increase.
Ms Palaszczuk said she had contacted WA Premier Mark McGowan about the app in the hope it may be able to be applied to Queensland’s quarantine regulations.
“What we will do, though, is they are launching an app and I’m very keen to know more about that,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“I texted Mark McGowan last night, I’ve asked for more information and we’ll be watching very carefully what they do in Western Australia with that app.”
Dubbed the G2G Now App, is designed to “complement the work of WA police” in what Mr McGowan suggested on Tuesday was an “Australian-first”.
Ms Palaszczuk also announced $28 million to fund two new wharves in far north Queensland to service ‘patrol boats’.
The wharves would be 100m and 80m long and provide “hundreds of jobs’ in the future.

The announcement comes just four weeks out from the state election and as Queensland reopens its borders to more northern NSW residents from Thursday.
On social media on Wednesday, Ms Palaszczuk thanked Queenslanders for their work in stopping the spread of the virus, as the global death toll reached one million.
“Of those more than 1 million deaths, six were Queenslanders,” she tweeted.
“This pandemic isn’t over, and we don’t want to see any more Queenslanders dying from this disease. Keep following the health advice.”
From Wednesday, there will be no ADF personnel manning the Queensland border, a day before allowing travel between the state and parts of northern NSW, including Byron, Ballina and Lismore.
Ahead of the border softening from 1am on Thursday, Gold Coast police chief superintendent Mark Wheeler urged motorists to be patient, with delays expected for the long weekend.
He said 15 extra police would replace the 60 defence force members withdrawing from the border.
From Thursday, Queenslanders will be able to travel to Byron Bay and vice versa without needing to quarantine, but they must have valid border declaration passes.

The family at the centre of New Zealand’s coronavirus cluster are struggling to cope with vile slurs spreading online about them.
The family at the centre of the COVID-19 cluster in Auckland were left “shell-shocked” when their tests for the virus came back positive.
The family of four, made up of three adults and a young child, were confirmed to be infected just hours before the news was given publicly in an emergency broadcast late on Tuesday, the NZ Herald reported.
It comes as the nation confirmed 13 new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand - 12 in the community and one in isolation.
Health Minister Chris Hipkins issued a stern warning about social media, saying sharing of unverified information had created “extreme distress” for the family at the centre of the current cluster.
He said one post in particular contained a “number of vile slurs and was totally and utterly wrong”.
Hipkins said it smacked of malicious behaviour.
“At a time we are fighting a pandemic, this sort of behaviour is designed to create panic ... and is completely unacceptable,” he said.
He made a plea to New Zealanders to be careful about what the believed and shared, and said information sourced on social media could not be treated as official.
Hipkins said there have always been rumours but this smacked of orchestration.
He begged people to think twice before sharing unverified “nonsense”.
“Please take your information from official sources,” he said.
“The information here is verified, the information that we share during these press conferences ... is information that you can trust. If a mistake is made, it is quickly corrected.”
Pacific health leader Dr Collin Tukuitonga said he knew the family and was in touch with them on Tuesday evening.

“They were shell-shocked that this had happened and they were a little embarrassed that it had happened to them,” he said.
Dr Tukuitonga, the Associate Dean (Pacific) and Associate Professor of Public Health at the University of Auckland, said the family – now in quarantine at a managed isolation facility – had a strong support system.
A small group of people were protecting the family – encouraging them not to read comments online and rumours that had started to spread on social media.
“It‘s not easy. The comments on social media have turned nasty.”

Dr Tukuitonga acknowledged anger among the Pacific community in the last few days after it was revealed the South Auckland family at the centre of the cluster are of Pasifika descent.
But doing so was important, he said, as this second wave of COVID-19 has hugely affected the Pacific community.
Of the 37 active cases in the community, up to 80 per cent identified as Pasifika.
“With the first wave, we were under-represented. But this second wave, the majority are Pacific.
“The Pacific community needs to understand that this time, it‘s different. Once you hear that – you can get quite (serious) about it,” he said.
“It just takes one highly infected person who goes to church or a function and that person alone can infect hundreds.”
Dr Tukuitonga is well respected in the health sector around the Pacific region.
He has worked for the World Health Organisation as the Co-ordinator of Surveillance and Prevention of Chronic Diseases, the chief executive for the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs and the Director of Public Health.
A CALL TO REPORT SECOND WAVE FIGURES SEPARATELY
Dr Tukuitonga’s bid to encourage more Pasifika people to get tested and to take this second wave seriously has resulted in him calling on current director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield to report the statistics separately.
“I‘ve sent a message to Ashley – we trained together – about this. I’ve been lobbying for the results to be reported separately.
“Of the 30-something cases in the community, all but two are Pacific.”
Yesterday, Reverend Victor Pouesi said he had urged up to 300 people at his congregation who attended church on Sunday to get tested after members of another family who attend that church had been confirmed as having COVID-19.
One of that family‘s members is understood to work with the initial family of four who contracted COVID-19.
Members of the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa, Māngere East Puaseisei were out in force at the church grounds yesterday after a pop-up testing station was set up specifically for members.
Dr Tukuitonga wants Pacific peoples to understand the gravity of the situation but also that the numbers of cases will go up before they come down again.
“Yesterday, the case numbers were high. Then they came down to seven. We‘re praying to God that tomorrow it’s only two – and then eventually, none.”

Four new pop-up COVID-19 testing clinics will be set up at strategic Queensland locations.
Four new pop-up coronavirus-testing clinics will be set up at targeted sites where tourists and residents converge.
Deputy Premier and Minister for Health and Ambulance Services Steven Miles said the government was scaling up testing efforts to detect any potential COVID-19 cases around the state.
“Pop-up swabbing clinics are being rolled out across Queensland as part of a testing blitz targeting transient groups like tourists and truck drivers to ensure anyone and everyone with symptoms are being tested,” Deputy Premier Miles said.
“We know that one of the most important things everyone can do to help in the fight against COVID-19 is to get tested immediately if they have any symptoms, no matter how mild, which include fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose, lack of taste or smell, and fatigue.
RELATED: More lives will be lost
“COVID-19 tests are free for tourists and visitors as well as residents and available at several locations around the state, including some drive-through sites.”
Clinics are being established at the Cairns Esplanade, Gold Coast Airport, Albert Waterways (Gold Coast) and Surfers Paradise Esplanade, with other regions ready to set up pop-up clinics if required.
Member for Gaven Meaghan Scanlon encouraged locals and tourists travelling too or through the Gold Coast to get tested, even if they only have mild symptoms.
“We have seen how quickly this virus can spread, that is why it is so important for anyone in Queensland to get tested if they show any symptoms of COVID-19,” Ms Scanlon said.
RELATED: Is this the first wave
“These pop-up testing clinics are in addition to other testing sites at the Gold Coast University Hospital, Robina Health Precinct Building near Robina Hospital, Community Respiratory Clinics in Burleigh Waters, Upper Coomera, Hope Island and Nerang as well as selected general practices.
“No appointment is needed and the test is fast and free.”

Staff members at a school in Sydney’s southwest have been tested for COVID-19 after they were linked to a pub cluster in the area.
Staff members at a school in Sydney’s southwest have been tested for COVID-19 after they were linked to a pub cluster in the area.
St Francis Catholic College in Edmondson Park issued a letter to parents and carers informing them that a group of teachers had attended the Crossroads Hotel on Friday July 3.
The Crossroads Hotel, in Casula, is now linked to at least eight suspected coronavirus cases in NSW.
“The staff members who attended the hotel did so after the school day ended and did not subsequently interact with students from the college,” the letter said.
“Every staff member who attended the hotel has undergone COVID-19 testing. All of the results have been negative to date, and we are now only waiting on a few final results to come through.”

It comes after NSW Health confirmed eight new cases of COVID-19 linked to an outbreak at the Crossroads Hotel.
Another pub has closed after one of those in the new cluster went to the pokies over three days.
“Another case linked to the outbreak attended Picton Hotel during their infectious period, attending on 4, 9 and 10 July in the gaming room. The hotel is closed for cleaning,” NSW Health said in a statement.
Dr Kerry Chant told 2GB Radio that the “focus is now on controlling the outbreak”.
She also confirmed that there are links between the Sydney cluster and the second wave of outbreaks in Melbourne.
“We do have some linkages to Melbourne but we need some further diagnostic tests,” she said.

Sydney has been on high alert for days, with large-scale testing regimes in place following reports of the pub outbreak.
Health authorities confirmed on Friday that two people who attended the Crossroads Hotel on Friday, July 3 were infected, prompting a pop-up testing clinic in the venue’s carpark.
A man from the Blue Mountains tested positive, NSW Health confirmed Saturday morning, and three members of his household have subsequently returned positive results.
These diagnoses follow another woman contracting the virus at the pub on the same night, with their visits declared the “only known link”.
RELATED:  Customer details weren’t taken at hotel, claims patron
Lauren, a customer who attended the hotel on Wednesday, said neither her name or any other contact details were recorded, leaving her disappointed that precautions weren’t taken.
The 26-year-old told news.com.au that the venue had been “relatively busy, as it would’ve been on any given night pre-COVID” but with less of a crowd.
And while the pub did have some social distancing measures in place – tables marked with signs telling people not to sit at them – she said it was mainly up to the patrons to ensure they were physically distanced from each other.
She said her name, phone number or other contact details weren’t taken at the door like other businesses had implemented since reopening.
“At the time I didn’t think about it too much, to be honest,” Lauren said.
“Reflecting on it now, it angers me. During the media conference they mentioned having a list of patrons … is this only the people who booked tables? Where was this list located?
“If they only had one list, why didn’t they lock off the rest of the entrances and have everyone walk through the same entry to sign it?”

Asked whether police had heard from witnesses who did not have their contact details taken at the pub, NSW Police Minister David Elliott said it would be part of the investigation.
“That’s a concern but that will be part of the investigation, and if people have information they should contact authorities,” he said at a press conference today.
It is understood pub patrons who’ve been tested will be told in the next 72 hours whether they have a positive result.
Australia’s deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth told reporters yesterday afternoon it was “critically important” that anybody who visited the pub isolates for 14 days and seeks a test.
NSW reported five new cases of COVID-19 yesterday, bringing its total to 3478.

If the MCG can’t host this year’s AFL grand final, Lions coach Chris Fagan says a Gabba decider should be the next option
Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan has called for this year’s AFL grand final to be played at the Gabba if the COVID-19 crisis rules out the MCG hosting the decider.
Queensland has become the new home of the AFL with the relocation of all 10 Victorian clubs to the Sunshine State.
Jostling for the right to stage the grand final has already started, with Western Australia and South Australia questioning the credentials of Queensland and NSW to host the match.

But Fagan said Queensland’s status has AFL’s temporary base should lead to a Gabba grand final.
“(A Queensland decider) should be given strong consideration,” Fagan said.
“Obviously the AFL have got contractual obligations to the MCG, and I would have thought that they’ll let that ride out for as long as they can before they make that decision.
“If it gets to the point where they know they can’t have it there, then it’s up for grabs.
“Queensland should be at the forefront, the Gabba should be the forefront of calculations for a grand final.”
Fagan, who hails from Tasmania, said every state was entitled to bid for the match if the MCG wasn’t an option.
“That’s just good fun parochialism between states. You’d expect that,” he said.
“If it was up for grabs, and I lived in South Australia or Western Australia, I’d be expecting my governments to put in strong claims to play the game there just as the government has in Queensland.
“That’s all understandable and it’ll just add to the theatre of this football season I’d imagine.”
Currently based in Sydney, the Lions meet GWS at Giants Stadium on Saturday before returning to Brisbane on Wednesday ahead of their next clash on Sunday week against Melbourne at Gold Coast venue Metricon Stadium.
Despite an abundance of matches to be played in Queensland for the rest of the season, it is reportedly the Lions and the Gold Coast Suns who will be among the teams asked to travel to Tasmania and the Northern Territory to play games.
And that’s fine with Fagan.
“The AFL do their best to try to make the competition as even as possible draw wise, and if that (Lions and Suns going to Tasmania and NT) happens, then so be it,” the Lions mentor said.
“We’ve all got to share the load in that regard and that’s not something we fear.
“We don’t even know that it’s going to happen, so we’ll just keep rolling with the punches.
“Who knows what will be happening in two weeks time because the landscape keeps changing.
“I’ve learnt to live this year pretty much a day at a time, and so have our players.”

The New South Wales Chief Health Officer has revealed breaches in infection control practices at the coronavirus-hit Newmarch House in Sydney’s west. 

Dr Kerry Chant said investigations were underway after announcing the concerning revelations at a press conference on Saturday. 

“There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not been occurred and those recommendations are being fed back and implemented as we speak,” she said. 

A further two staff members tested positive to the virus in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of infections at the facility to 61. 

Thirteen residents at the Newmarch House have died from COVID-19 after a nurse went to work at the facility while unknowingly positive.

A western Sydney aged care home at the centre of a COVID-19 outbreak after a carer attended work infected has recorded its first death. It comes as health chiefs attempt to assemble a crew of immune Ruby Princess staff to take the stricken vessel to sea.
A resident at an aged-care home in western Sydney has died from coronavirus.
Anglicare told families of residents in Newmarch House at Caddens of the death this morning.
“We are saddened to inform you that a resident of Newmarch House, who tested positive, passed away peacefully this morning,” Anglicare’s Residential Chief Operating Officer Gavin Pretorius told families by email.
“We would like to assure you that the staff are doing everything possible to care for your loved one.
“Please be assured of our prayers for you at this challenging time.”
As of Friday, there were 20 residents and 10 staff at Newmarch House who had contracted COVID-19.
The outbreak at Newmarch House is believed to have been caused by a member of staff who continued to work at the home for six days after unknowingly contracting the virus in early April.
NOT AN OLD PERSON’S DISEASE
A 42-year-old man has become the youngest person to die of COVID-19 in Australia.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly, who confirmed the death, said the 42-year-old man was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship leaving Fremantle today.
“So that is by far our youngest person that has died in Australia from this disease and a terrible tragedy for that man and his family,” Prof Kelly told reporters.
“But it is a reminder for us that this is not just an old person’s disease.”
The 42-year-old crewman from the Philippines died in a Perth hospital on Thursday.
The news follows NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard’s warning this morning that younger people were not immune to the virus, with about 42 per cent of all cases aged under 40.
“So for those of you who think that you cannot get COVID-19 because you are younger, well, the answer is, you absolutely can,” Mr Hazzard said
“1238 people of the total 2936 cases that are confirmed (in NSW) are all under the age of 40.
“So my strong message … to young people is to take it very, very seriously. Very, very seriously.”
The age group with the highest infections are 20-29 year olds.”
Two more people died of COVID-19 in NSW overnight but just ten new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, despite the number of tests dramatically increasing to 5152.
The NSW deaths — an 83-year-old Queensland resident who died in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital after recently returning from a cruise to South America on the Celebrity Eclipse, and a 58-year-old female who died in Tamworth Hospital — take the state toll to 28.
There are currently 25 patients in intensive care units, 18 ventilated.
Mr Brad Hazzard said the low new case numbers were an indication that social distancing measures were working and being adopted by the public.
“If the community had not listened to that message, we would certainly be in a lot more challenging times than we currently are.
Meanwhile health chiefs are trying to assemble a “core” crew of Ruby Princess staff who are immune from coronavirus before it returns to sea with police commissioner Mick Fuller said he was prepared to delay the COVID-19 stricken vessel’s departure.
A massive international expansion of the criminal probe into the virus-hit ship was also announced yesterday, with police to quiz almost 6000 passengers from its last two voyages.
CREW TESTED FOR ANTIBODIES
A COVID-19 antibody test developed at Westmead Hospital is being used to swab infected crew members to see if they have developed a resistance to the virus.
There are 153 crew members with coronavirus on the ship docked at Port Kembla, where it was due to leave on Sunday.
The death toll linked to the ship is now 21 after two ex-passengers died in the US.
NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant said stringent testing was still being carried out.
“Some of the things that we’re looking at are, do they have sufficient staff to … operate the boat?” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“Obviously we need to make sure that the core group of people are well that need to operate the boat and preferably that they’re all, either, immune and they’re not at risk of coming down with the illness should there be any residual disease transmission on the ship,” Ms Chant said.
“The antibody test is a more laborious test. It is having to be done in batches, we have to bleed the staff, so it is more time consuming than taking the swabs.
“This will really help us formulate a plan to present to the commissioner (of police), Australian Border Force and Carnival.”
Mr Mick Fuller has the final say on when the ship must leave and said he would extend Sunday’s deadline if NSW Health needed more time.
“We’re still moving towards that day but clearly if health advice is that I need to wait another couple of days then no doubt Border Force and NSW Police would honour that,” Mr Fuller said.
PASSENGERS QUIZZED, CRUISE COMPANY SUED
The first international fatalities linked to the Ruby Princess emerged this week, when two US, Steve Lazaru and Chung Chen, died after returning home after the voyage. Mr Chen’s family is reportedly taking legal action against the cruise company.

Detectives running the criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess announced on Friday thousands of Ruby Princess passengers and crew would be sent an online survey within days. Questions include whether the passengers had taken any videos or photos on board or if they had seen anyone being kept in quarantine.
Police are not only looking at the infamous voyage which disembarked passengers in Sydney on March 19 but the ship’s previous trip as well, from February 24 to March 8.
“Obviously what we’re looking to do there is create a baseline from which we can assess what occurred on the second cruise,” Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said.
“Obviously that goes hand-in-hand with the forensic examination of the telemetry box on the ship.”
Asked whether his detectives were looking for evidence the virus was on the ship before it left Sydney on March 8, Mr Stuart said: “I’m not going to speculate on anything until the investigation uncovers that and the coroner makes a decision”.
He said there were eight known deaths connected to the ship in NSW, another 11 suspected of being connected and “indirect deaths” would also be investigated.
“Obviously the coroner has an interest in indirect deaths — so a passenger interacts with an individual that may have contracted COVID-19,” Mr Stuart said.
The first international fatality to be linked to the Ruby Princess emerged this week, Californian man Steve Lazarus died in the US after travelling here with his wife.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/science/inside-look-at-how-sydney-is-testing-wastewater-to-find-coronavirus/news-story/7cba7b1f903c28c193ce8f1f68d84453
Health authorities have shown how they test wastewater to find COVID-19 lurking in the community - and they can even narrow it down by suburb.
Wastewater testing for coronavirus fragments in NSW is becoming more effective, raising hopes the virus can be contained while the state waits for the rollout of a vaccine.
Sydney Water’s lab team have been able to significantly ramp up the rate of wastewater COVID-19 testing by automating part of the process.
The team that analyses sewage run-off to detect coronavirus fragments on behalf of NSW Health has installed new equipment, allowing them to nearly double the rate of testing from 80 samples a week to almost 150.
“We needed to be able to increase the efficacy of the process,” Sydney Water executive Maryanne Graham said in an interview at the utility’s laboratory in the Sydney suburb of West Ryde.
“Because while we may not have a high level of positive cases in the community (at the moment), we need to continue testing and stay on top of it.”
Testing wastewater for coronavirus fragments has become an essential part of the NSW government’s strategy to fight the community spread of COVID-19.
The idea is that a person who has been infected will shed virus fragments that are going to travel with the flush of a toilet to eventually end up in sewage treatment plants.
By analysing water samples from those plants authorities can detect whether the virus is spreading in a specific area.
On Tuesday, NSW Health announced samples from a waste treatment plant in the Sydney suburb of Liverpool contained virus fragments.
That plant treats wastewater from some 40 suburbs with a population of close to 180,000.
Such information is crucial to encourage targeted virus testing of residents, and with the increased rate of wastewater analysis the hope is the fragments can be detected quicker.
Most days of the week, wastewater samples, chilled on ice and transported in eskis by courier services, arrive at the lab in West Ryde.
There, the murky water goes through a three-step process. The first step is to filter the wastewater, putting it through a membrane that essentially works as a coffee filter. If COVID-19 is present in the wastewater, it will stick to the membrane.
That filter is then put in a vial and sent to a different part of the lab for step two – extracting a molecule called ribonucleic acid (RNA), which the virus uses to encode its genetic information.
That’s done by shredding the filter, adding some chemicals, and grinding it into a smoothie. After separating the liquid from the debris, virus RNA is purified.
Then, finally, the experts analyse that sample to see whether molecular markers of COVID-19 are present.
It’s the second step that’s been automated, leading to a big leap in efficiency.
The virus lab team, around 20 staffers led by technical specialist Sudhi Payyappat, purchased a $50,000 apparatus called a QIAcube that will extract the ribonucleic acid automatically, a process that would previously take hours to do by hand.
“The robotics have been a big step forwards,” said Ms Graham, who is general manager for customer strategy and engagement at Sydney Water.
Another recent development is the ability to test sewage pumping stations, which contain waste from smaller amounts of people. That process will allow Sydney Water’s lab experts to narrow down the results down to specific suburbs.
“Our COVID team is always looking at how they can innovate to improve the process,” Ms Graham said.

Several people were arrested after a large crowd gathered in Sydney for an Australia Day protest, despite COVID-19 health orders limiting gatherings to 500 people. Police said they had agreed with organisers that a planned march would be cancelled and that they would “divide the large crowd into socially distanced groups of less than 500 people.” However, police were prompted to issue a formal warning after “a large group attempted to commence a march in Hyde Park.” Five people, four of whom were part of the protest, were arrested during the police attempt to disperse the crowd.

AFL icon Leigh Matthews has ripped into Cricket Australia over its handling of an Australia Day storm and entitled COVID-19 request.
AFL legend Leigh Matthews has hit out at Cricket Australia’s move to ask for government help in having its players vaccinated against COVID-19 after being on the receiving end of a stern rebuke from Scott Morrison.
The Prime Minister condemned the governing body’s decision to omit any reference to Australia Day in its Big Bash games on Tuesday, as CA instead chooses to promote them as “January 26” matches following consultation with Indigenous leaders.

Morrison labelled the move “pretty ordinary” but has since faced a wave of backlash from cricketers and other athletes — including Olympic hero Cathy Freeman — over his Australia Day remarks, which included saying: “You know on Australia Day, it’s all about acknowledging how far we’ve come. When those 12 ships turned up in Sydney all those years ago, it wasn’t a particularly flash day for the people on those vessels either.”
The Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday CA has formally asked the federal government if its players can receive the vaccine to protect against COVID-19 before they jet off on a tour to South Africa next month, because the country is deemed a “very high risk” destination for contracting the virus.
The vaccine rollout is expected to begin in the coming weeks and months Down Under, and CA’s request was seen by some as an unfair attempt to jump to the front of the queue.
Hawthorn champion Matthews, who coached the Brisbane Lions to three straight premierships, is one such figure who thinks it’s a bit rich for cricket to be asking for special treatment. He then went a step further, linking the vaccine request to the sport’s stance on Australia Day.
“CA certainly have plenty of cheek,” Matthews tweeted. “Mess around with the government currently mandated January 26 being known as Australia Day and then wanting a favour from the government to jump the COVID vaccination queue.”

Plenty disagreed with Matthews, jumping in the comments to make their opposition known.
Sports writer Richard Hinds wrote: “Leigh do you believe government aid or support is dependent on supporting the government’s political agenda and not merely on the merit of your claim for taxpayer funds?”
Several days ago Matthews had actually voiced his support to change the date of Australia Day. “Got to agree that January 1st, the anniversary of Federation is the most appropriate date for Australia Day,” he tweeted.
Earlier in the month the footy icon caused a stir when he defended deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack for saying “all lives matter”.
“Sometimes you just scratch your head with what you hear, being outraged about a simple uttering that all lives matter is bewildering as is the view that violent riots are OK if you support the underlying cause, beats me!” Matthews tweeted.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has taken another swipe at her counterparts over borders, this time accusing them of ‘making stuff up’.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has taken another swipe at her counterparts over the latest border chaos, saying she is “frustrated” before accusing them of making stuff up.
Speaking to 2GB’s Ben Fordham, Ms Berejiklian said she didn’t want to “single out” any other premiers but said they shouldn’t get to decide what is a hot spot and what isn’t.
“The central health authorities have deemed that there isn’t a single place in Australia that’s a hot spot. Why should any premier determine what is a hot spot and what isn’t?,” she said.
“We have to go by the science and the data.
“NSW … touch wood … (is) where we are at this point in time is because we’ve taken the health advice and based decisions on the science.”
Other states and territories slammed their borders shut to Sydney, and even regional NSW, in December after the northern beaches outbreak came to light.
So far, all have been reluctant to reopen them, aside from the ACT, which has deemed 11 government area as hot spots.
The Premier was also probed about incentives to encourage Australians to get the COVID-19 vaccination, with the rollout to begin as early as next month.
One of those incentives includes refusing anti-vaxxers entry to certain high-risk venues such as pubs and clubs or other hospitality businesses.
“It’s important for the community to start thinking about the vaccine and how they feel about it,” the Premier said.
“These are conversations for the next few weeks but already airlines have indicated you can’t travel overseas (unless you get jabbed), which will be an incentive for a lot of people.
“We will also consider whether we allow venues to do that.”
She acknowledged while the vaccination is the federal government’s responsibility in terms of the rollout, all workplaces and state governments will also have a say in encouraging people to get it.
The Premier could not answer whether schoolteachers would be required to get the vaccination, but those were “conversations yet to happen”.
“But there should be incentives in place for people to do certain things for their own safety and the safety of others,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“I would like there to be an incentive system where people are encouraged to have it (the vaccine) because it means they can do all these things which they may otherwise not have been able to do.”
Her comments come months after Qantas boss Alan Joyce revealed the airline’s “no jab, no fly” policy that requires travellers to be jabbed first before they can fly internationally.

There will be a welcome sight at AFL and AFLW clubs this week when full groups resume training for the first time since NSW’s COVID outbreak threatened their return.
AFL and AFLW teams were free to resume full-group training from Sunday after receiving the green light from league headquarters.
It’s understood the AFL contacted all 18 clubs on Saturday night to say players and staff who had received a negative COVID-19 test result this week could resume normal outdoor activities.
Clubs were previously restricted to training in groups of no more than 10 after being allowed to return on Wednesday.

Three AFLW squads – Richmond, Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs – took advantage of the restrictions being lifted to train in hot conditions on Sunday morning.
The Tigers even played an intraclub game of three 20-minute quarters.
Richmond’s AFL side delayed an official training return until Monday to be able to train as one group from the outset, and triple premiership coach Damien Hardwick will be on deck.
Gold Coast will also resume on Monday – after giving its players and staff a longer break – and will be largely unaffected by the three-day Greater Brisbane COVID-19 lockdown.
The Lions had to cancel AFL and AFLW sessions after the announcement.
However, the Suns will complete their 2km time trial and skills session in small groups rather than as one full squad.
Every other AFL club was back at training this week, including Collingwood, which kicked off its post-Christmas preparations on Friday.
There’s also good news at the Bulldogs, where No. 1 draft pick Jamarra Ugle-Hagan and ruck recruit Stefan Martin can train with their teammates from next week after delays in their COVID-19 test results.
They were notably absent from the Dogs’ first couple of sessions because of those delays, as per AFL rules, but have since received their results and tested negative.
GWS youngster Xavier O’Halloran is isolating in Sydney after visiting a Melbourne clothing store now on the COVID alert list.
The 20-year-old Victorian was in a South Melbourne sportswear shop on December 30 between midday and 12.45pm, when it was considered an exposed location.
O’Halloran had already tested negative by the time the Victorian Health Department added the store to its alert list on Tuesday night, as he prepared to return to training on Wednesday.
The midfielder is following Victoria Health protocols by quarantining at home, away from the Giants teammates he lives with.
The club is not concerned because O’Halloran has tested negative.
He exits quarantine on Thursday next week, 14 days from exposure.
Drafted with pick 22 in 2018, O’Halloran has played two games for the Giants.
GWS Irish defender Callum Brown is also in quarantine, while countryman Colin O’Riordan will leave isolation and return to Swans training next week.
COVID revelation: Blue stayed in NSW as borders closed
A Carlton footballer has elected to remain in NSW with family rather than rush back to Victoria to beat the COVID-19-related border closure on Friday night.
The Blues are now working through when the young player can get back into the state, with AFL clubs set to resume training on Wednesday after the Christmas break.
The initial belief was Victorians who returned after the midnight Friday cut-off would still be able to get back in, but would have to serve hotel quarantine.
However, Department of Health COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar has since confirmed only exceptional cases would be let in.
“If you seek to cross the border after midnight tonight you will be turned back,” Weimar said on Friday.
“We are not running a hotel quarantine scheme for convenience.
“We have been very clear for a number of weeks now around the risks of travelling to NSW.”
Port Adelaide has told a handful of players still on holidays in Victoria to either return to South Australia immediately or be on standby to come back at short notice amid the increasing COVID-19 cases in Melbourne.
As Victoria recorded 10 new COVID-19 community transmission cases on Saturday, Port told its Victorian players to be on standby.
The Power will resume pre-season training on Wednesday and the 2020 minor premiers will be wanting to avoid a situation where a snap border closure would force any players left in Victoria into 14 days isolation.
Port already has new recruit and former Sydney resident, Aliir Aliir, in self-isolation, and the 196cm defender will miss the first week of pre-season’s resumption.
The Power confirmed Aliir recently travelled back to Sydney for a check-up on his jaw, which was operated on after the 2020 season, and was then forced into self-isolation on his return to Adelaide.
Aliir will join his new teammates at Alberton in the second week of January.
Melbourne had two footballers in NSW, while North Melbourne had AFL and AFLW staff there but no players after warning of the risk.
A Richmond footballer was in NSW as well, but has returned and is completing quarantine at home.
St Kilda largely avoided the drama, although it recalled a squad member – not club champion Jack Steele – who was in Canberra.
Four Gold Coast players returned to Queensland from NSW on New Year’s Day.
There are complications for Greater Western Sydney’s AFLW side, which has congregated in Albury for the time-being, but is effectively stranded in NSW awaiting further advice.
The Giants are scheduled to start their season against Fremantle in Perth on January 31.
Fremantle will resume post-Christmas training with about one-third of its squad in quarantine as the national COVID-19 border drama rages on.
The Dockers confirmed to News Corp on Friday the last of their players returned from Melbourne to Perth before the new year was rung in, just in time to satisfy the WA border closure.
Details on how and where the 14 quarantined Fremantle players will train are still being thrashed out, while four Gold Coast footballers are returning to Queensland on New Year’s Day.
With state and territory governments closing their borders to NSW, and some to Victoria, AFL and AFLW stars and staff are caught among those desperately scrambling to return home.
St Kilda and Geelong are among the Victorian clubs without players in NSW, although the Saints have recalled a player – not reigning best and fairest winner Jack Steele – who was in Canberra.
Melbourne had two players in NSW who’ve been asked to race home.
One Richmond footballer was in NSW, but is back in Melbourne and starting home quarantine.
No North Melbourne footballers were in the COVID-hit-state – after being warned to avoid travelling there – but staff from both its AFL and AFLW programs were, with positive cases on the rise.
Those staff will dash home before midnight on Friday to avoid border closures, then undergo coronavirus tests on their return.
Any Queensland Government decision to flag any specific areas as ‘hot spots’ could impact on the need for the Suns quartet to self-isolate, including their return-to-training conditions.
On Friday afternoon, Greater Western Sydney’s women’s footballers made their way from the various locations they’d spent their Christmas breaks – including from COVID-19 hotspot locations in Greater Sydney and Sydney’s Northern Beaches, and various locations interstate – to Albury, where the team plans to resume training on Saturday, January 2.
The Giants, who are scheduled to kick off their AFLW season against Fremantle in Perth on January 31, are technically stranded in NSW, with all states having imposed hard borders on NSW.
Originally, the Giants planned to spend two weeks in regional Albury before heading to Melbourne, where they’d spend another two weeks and then onto Perth having satisfied all then-in-place government requirements to enter the states.
But when WA imposed a hard border on Victoria late on Thursday, that plan was scuttled.
If current restrictions remain in force, GWS will face a 14-day quarantine period when entering any other state.
The team is planning on spending the next two weeks in Albury for pre-season training, and will then await further advice and instruction from government authorities as well as the AFL as to the next steps.
AFL clubs are scrambling to get their male and female stars home after a series of snap border closures were triggered by Sydney’s worsening COVID crisis.
While Sydney Swans and Greater Western Sydney continue to plan for a return to training on January 6, other AFL clubs moved to immediately recall players holidaying interstate.
Melbourne and North Melbourne are among the clubs advising its AFL and AFLW footballers to return as soon as possible.
The Demons on Thursday night confirmed it had multiple players currently in NSW.
None of the Kangaroos’ players are in NSW after being warned against it before going on their break, although some staff from both programs are in the COVID-19-hit state.
Those staff will bolt back home before midnight on New Year’s Day to avoid border closures before undergoing coronavirus tests on their return.
Kangaroos’ players and staff on the border have already returned to Melbourne.
It’s understood there won’t be any quarantine requirements at this stage.
Geelong and St Kilda don’t have any players in NSW.
The AFLW season is in jeopardy with border closures wreaking havoc, forcing the AFL to consider multiple contingencies.
On Thursday, both the South Australian and Victorian governments announced they were closing their borders to all NSW residents from midnight on January 1, joining Western Australia in introducing a hard border.
Hours later WA closed its border to Victoria.
The turmoil leaves the Giants’ women’s team stranded in NSW with less than a month until the start of the AFLW season. Their first match is scheduled to be played in WA on January 31.
The Giants women’s team will on Friday relocate to Albury for 14 days, before then moving into Melbourne to play a practice match on the weekend of January 15/16.
The team was then planning to travel to WA 14 days later for their opening Round 1 game against the Dockers on January 31 at Fremantle Oval.
The reason for the relocation to Albury was that it would satisfy the then-in-place government requirements to enter Victoria, which only restricted residents from COVID-19 hot spots, including Greater Sydney, from entering the state.
But Victoria’s decision to close its border to all of NSW from midnight complicates that plan. The Giants will work with the Victorian Government and the AFL on the next step, which on Thursday night was uncertain.
Western Australia’s decision to stop Victorian’s entering the state unless they have an exemption could potentially force a raft of fixture changes and make a “hub” a real possibility to save the season.
As it stands, there are four matches scheduled to be played in NSW in the nine-round 2021 season: GWS takes on Melbourne in Round 2 on February 6, followed by Brisbane on February 13, then Western Bulldogs on February 28 all at Blacktown International Sportspark. The Giants then take on St Kilda on March 20 at Giants Stadium.
Should border restrictions remain in place beyond January, none of those games will be possible for the travelling teams and it could mean all AFLW games are rescheduled outside NSW.
Considering the 2020 AFLW season was cancelled with no premier declared during the height of the global pandemic, the AFL will be desperate to see this season played out in full.
For Sydney’s AFL clubs, at this stage, players from both the Swans and GWS are scheduled to return from leave on January 6 as originally planned.
The Swans say they are expecting to train at Moore Park in line with both the AFL and state government protocols, while the Giants will return to their training headquarters at Sydney Olympic Park.
However, both clubs will be keeping close watch on COVID numbers over the coming days and whether the state government introduces restrictions on group training sessions, which are currently not in play.
An AFL spokesman said: “We will continue to monitor the situation and will be led by the Government and health officials when adapting to the changing environment. We are committed to the season and will adjust accordingly as required.”

A busy supermarket has been added to the list of Victorian venues on alert, as authorities reveal new details of the Chadstone man’s movements.
Health authorities have listed the specific times that a confirmed case of COVID-19 

visited 11 stores at Chadstone shopping centre on Boxing Day.
Victoria’s Department of Health and Human Services updated the advice for Boxing Day shoppers on Thursday evening as they also added Woolworths Southland – another major shopping centre in Melbourne’s southeast – to the list of coronavirus venue alerts.
Both Chadstone and the MCG are being investigated as potential coronavirus acquisition sites after a man attended the Boxing Day sales and day two of the Boxing Day Test and later tested positive to COVID-19.
Health authorities do not believe the man was infectious during his time at both locations, but rather acquired the virus there.
The new alerts come as Victoria recorded zero new locally acquired cases and zero new hotel quarantine cases on Thursday.
At least 95 sites have now been listed on the DHHS website as coronavirus exposure sites.
Anyone who attended the following stores at Chadstone on December 26 during the times listed below must get tested immediately and quarantine until a negative result is received:
The health department said the proximity of the stores meant there could be overlaps in the times when the man attended individual stores.
Woolworths at Southland Shopping Centre in Cheltenham was also added to the venue alerts list on Thursday after a confirmed case shopped in store on December 31.
Anyone who attended the store between 6pm and 6.30pm has been urged to monitor for symptoms and get tested immediately if they develop and then isolate until a negative result it received.
Other venues updated late on Thursday by the DHHS include the Merrymen Cafe in Hampton, the Sikh Temple in Keysborough, Coles Hallam, the Woodlands Golf Club in Mordialloc, Costco Moorabbin and Wonthaggi Plaza.
A full list of exposure sites can be found on the DHHS website.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/queensland-quarantine-hotel-cleaner-tests-positive-for-covid19/news-story/46f6f7b1f58000b2ca1094c96298b81d
People in three Queensland suburbs have been urged to get tested, as a hotel cleaner tests positive to the mutant UK strain of COVID-19.
Restrictions have been placed on visits to hospitals, aged-care and disability services after a cleaner at a Brisbane quarantine hotel tested positive for the UK mutant strain of COVID-19.
Queensland’s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeanette Young said the restrictions to vulnerable facilities in Greater Brisbane was a precaution, while contact tracing efforts continued.
“We’re taking a very cautious approach with this case, now that we know for sure this person has the UK variant of the virus,” she said in a statement late Thursday.
“Evidence shows that this variant is 70 per cent more infectious than other strains.
“This is why I’m taking this firm action swiftly, to protect our most vulnerable facilities.”
The visit ban also applies to corrections facilities and will be enforced immediately and comes as Queensland bans Greater Sydney residents from entering the state until at least February.
“These restrictions apply to the Metro North, Metro South and West and West Moreton Hospital and Health and Service regions,” she said.
The cleaner, a woman in her 20s, has had the highly infectious strain of the virus, which has been spreading through the UK, since January 2.
Coincidentally, a child who recently arrived from the UK and is in hotel quarantine also tested positive for the virus but not the mutant strain.
Ms Young said earlier on Thursday that the worker was deemed infectious from January 2 and worked at the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
The cleaner was tested as part of the weekly testing regimen for quarantine hotel workers.
“So she got tested as part of our routine, weekly … testing, on December 29 and was negative,” Ms Young said.
“Since then, she has developed symptoms. So she came forward to get tested, and we got that result late last night.
“So we’ve been working with her through the night and she has been fantastic and has co-operated fully.”
Earlier, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the cleaner “did everything right” by getting tested immediately after she started showing symptoms of the virus.
The two people are among 20 active cases in Queensland, most of them in hotel quarantine, following 15,000 tests overnight.
“This cleaner did everything right,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“She developed the symptoms yesterday and got tested yesterday.”
Ms Palaszczuk also ruled out opening the borders to Greater Sydney residents in January, and said the state was watching Victoria.
“In relation to travellers coming from Greater Sydney, you will not be allowed to come to Queensland,” she said.
“This will be reviewed at the end of the month.
“I know this is very disappointing for people during this time, but we are concerned still about Greater Sydney.”
Dr Young called for testing to be ramped up so employees are tested after each shift.
“I would like every single one of these people to be tested every shift, not just every seven days,” she said.
Anyone in the Sunnybank Hills, Algester and Calamvale areas with symptoms should get tested, Dr Young said.
The new cases come as Victoria and NSW recorded zero new cases in the past 24 hour testing period.
She asked anyone who visited Orange, Nyngan and Broken Hill from January 2-3 to get tested immediately and quarantine at home until they receive a negative test result.
The hotel cleaner travelled to and from the Hotel Grand Chancellor on a train on January 2 before visiting a local shopping centre the following day.
Anyone who visited these sites at the following dates and times and is showing symptoms of coronavirus is urged to get tested immediately.
TRAIN: Altandi to Roma St station, January 2, 7am
TRAIN: Central Station to Altandi, January 2, 4pm
CALAMVALE: Woolworths Central Shopping Centre, January 3, 11am – noon
SUNNYBANK HILLS: Coles, January 5, 7.30am
SUNNYBANK HILLS: Shoppingtown Newsagent, 8.15am

A Boost Juice worker based within a popular Melbourne shopping centre has tested positive to coronavirus meaning two kiosks have been forced to close.
Two Boost Juice kiosks at a major Melbourne shopping centre have been shut after a worker tested positive for coronavirus.
In a statement, Chadstone Shopping Centre said it was working closely with the team at Boost Juice.
“Our team has been notified a person who worked at Boost Juice (outside Bonds) has returned a positive test for COVID-19. The team member last worked on-site on Tuesday 29 December between 6pm – 11pm,” it said.
“Both kiosks at Chadstone are currently closed and a deep clean has been undertaken. We’ve also completed a deep clean of our centre, as an additional precaution.”
The information – which came out on Monday – is yet to be released on the Department of Health’s website.
It comes as restaurants, a cinema and hair salon were added to the list of Victorian locations exposed to the coronavirus, with health authorities asking people who visited the sites to get tested and quarantine immediately.
Victoria recorded three new locally acquired cases on Monday.
But long queues for testing forced many to turn back, sparking fears there could be more virus in the community.
Anyone who visited these locations listed on the DHHS website  must get tested immediately and quarantine for 14 days regardless of symptoms.
BLACK ROCK: Smile Buffalo Thai restaurant from 7.30-9.30pm on December 21; 6.30-9.40pm on December 21 and 7.30-9pm on December 27.
BRIGHTON: Royal Brighton Yacht Club from 12-2pm on December 29.

An epidemiology expert has claimed having crowds at the SCG for the New Year’s Test match could pose an “unnecessary risk”.
An epidemiology expert has claimed having crowds at the SCG for next week’s Test match   could pose an “unnecessary risk” as the Greater Sydney’s coronavirus cluster grows.
After it was revealed there were seven new cases of COVID-19 in New South Wales on Saturday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian restricted outdoor gatherings to 2000 people.
With the third Test match between Australia and India scheduled to commence on Thursday, it therefore seemed incredibly unlikely the event could go ahead in Sydney.
However, Ms Berejiklian emphasised the SCG rules remain in place for the time being, and any changes to the 50 per cent capacity limit would be decided following a safety review of the venue.

But speaking on ABC’s Weekend Breakfast, epidemiology expert Professor Raina MacIntyre explained why hosting up to 24,000 spectators at the New Year’s Test was “quite risky”.
“I think it is an unnecessary risk at this critical time,” Prof MacIntyre said on Sunday morning.
“It may also be a time when the cases are starting to increase because if there were transmissions on New Year’s Eve, we would be expecting to see a rise in cases from the end of this week over the following weekend.
“So the timing is also quite risky.”
Prof MacIntyre is a researcher at the University of New South Wales, and has been studying pandemics and disease for more than 28 years.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, NSW Deputy Premier John conceded the lingering threat of rain could impact the public safety plan at the SCG.
“There are some concerns about the SCG and the upcoming Test that (NSW) Health is working with those organisers,” Mr Barilaro said on Sunday.
“We’ve got to deal with some issues around wet weather, if that was to apply over the few days.”
The Deputy Premier also advised people from Cumberland Shire to reconsider whether they attend the Test match.
“(NSW Health) is working with the SCG and the Cricket Australia and organisers to make sure that when the next Test is played in Sydney it’s done in a safe way,” Mr Barilaro said. “We protect those patrons, we protect the community.
“We have already proven in this state that we can hold large events like the NRL Grand Final and State of Origin, and we haven’t had that issue of a transmission.”
Ms Berejiklian believes the SCG Test would provide a beneficial community morale boost, meaning the venue is currently exempt from the newly-introduced COVID-19 guidelines.
“Our health officials, police and event organisers will be doing a walk-through to go over the … COVID-safe plan,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Saturday.
“This is an example where the NSW government strategy is to keep jobs, to keep community morale and wellbeing while making sure we are COVID-safe.
“There are very stringent guidelines in that plan about making sure people stay within the zones they are required to stay in.
“It will be a very controlled and ticketed event, and the fact that people have to wear a mask when going to or from the event, public transport or otherwise, will also mitigate the risk.

“We appreciate what people might say about us continuing to hold those events, but also consider the thousands of jobs it keeps, consider the sense of normality it gives us.
“I recall some people were very upset when they heard we were continuing with the fireworks display, but … most of us felt a sense of relief there was something we could look forward to and something we could find a sense of normality through.”
However, the decision to proceed with the event has sparked significant backlash, with many social media users questioning why it was allowed to go ahead while other tough new rules have been introduced to curb the spread of the latest alarming coronavirus outbreak.
Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed at this stage masks would not be compulsory for spectators at the SCG. However, anyone travelling to the ground via public transport would be required to wear a mask.
Iâm looking forward to watching the Third Test against India in Sydney, from home. NSW is on a knife-edge and the Government must reconsider allowing 24,000 people into the SCG during a pandemic. #nswpol pic.twitter.com/l3kJHKcjg7

A person who attended a coronavirus exposure site has tested positive for the virus, their employer - Yarra Trams - has confirmed.

A Yarra Trams worker has tested positive for COVID-19.
The employee, who worked at the Malvern depot, contracted the virus after attending a public exposure site, Yarra Trams confirmed.
A spokeswoman for the company said the employee “has no interaction with passengers or the public”.
“The employee is self-isolating and work areas they frequented have been deep cleaned. All our employees who are possible close contacts have been identified, and are self-isolating and getting tested,” the spokeswoman said.
It is understood that as soon as the infected worker found out they had attended a public exposure site, they were tested and returned a positive result on January 1.
Victoria has recorded 10 new locally acquired coronavirus cases, while a genomic link has been established between the Victorian outbreak and an outbreak in New South Wales.
All of the 10 new cases are linked to the Black Rock cluster, including in one staff member at Smile Buffalo Thai restaurant and several others who dined at the restaurant on December 21.
Two of the cases were reported in NSW, but are Victorian residents. These two cases were announced yesterday. These two cases have returned back in Melbourne.
Health Minister Martin Foley will provide a virus update from 9.45am.
18,337 tests were recorded in the past 24 hours.
Two cases were also recorded in returned overseas travellers.
There are currently 29 active cases in Victoria.
Eighteen cases have now been linked to a Black Rock Thai restaurant in just 48 hours since Victoria’s 60-day coronavirus-free run ended.
More virus exposure sites are expected to be announced later today, including sites in Camberwell.
More than 220 primary close contacts of the cases have been ordered into 14-day isolation, while health investigators are also placing their secondary contacts into isolation for potentially shorter periods until more about their level of risk emerges.
It comes as New South Wales records seven new cases.
Ballarat federal member Catherine King will undergo a Covid-19 test after confirming she had visited a coronavirus public exposure site while on holiday.
The Labor member said in a Tweet on Saturday evening that she had “just found out” that she had been to the Chants Summer Carnival in Lakes Entrance in eastern Victoria - which DHHS has added to the list of places visited by a confirmed case of COVID-19.
“Not the best way to end our holiday,” Ms King wrote in a Tweet.
“Just found out we were at an exposure site and will test and isolate but so grateful to DHHS for up to date info and clear instructions- oh and the mandatory mask wearing. It makes a difference!”
Returned NSW travellers who could not provide sufficient documentation have been made to enter hotel quarantine.
DHHS testing commander Jeroen Weimer said 70 people had entered hotel quarantine after arriving in Victoria on flights from NSW.
The Alfred Hospital and North Melbourne coronavirus testing sites have closed due to overwhelming demand for the second day in a row.
By 3pm, people were being turned away by security staff at The Alfred, despite the clinic listing its opening hours as 8am until 6pm.
The security guard told people arriving to come back on Sunday morning.
Queues were building at COVID testing sites across Victoria early on Saturday morning after several were forced to close early due to overwhelming demand on Friday.
Testing commander Jeroen Weimar urged everyone who had been to exposure sites or had symptoms to get tested, but they should be prepared for lengthy delays.
“Make sure you are prepared with water and diversionary material to wait out the queues that will be there,” he said.
He urged everyone to keep trying to get tested, and to isolate in the meantime.
Two NSW travellers who allegedly fled from police to dodge hotel quarantine after flying into Melbourne from Canberra will be fined at least $19,000 each breaching coronavirus restrictions.
Health Minister Martin Foley confirmed the 26-year-old man and 24-year-old woman had returned to the Goulburn region in NSW after the incident.
Two more people who attended the Smile Buffalo Thai restaurant on December 21, before travelling to NSW on December 30, were confirmed as coronavirus-positive on Friday.
The two were already in line for a COVID-19 test in NSW on Thursday when contacted by Victoria’s health department in relation to their attendance at the restaurant. However, Victorian authorities were not aware of their positive results until late on Friday as their positive tests were recorded in NSW.
The pair have now returned to Victoria to isolate, but had visited Lakes Entrance on December 28 and 29.
Mr Weimar said it has been a “phenomenal piece of detective work” for contact tracers to have identified and isolated all the latest cases before they had tested positive, minimising the chances of further spread.
However, with the virus having been present for up to a fortnight and its exact source still a mystery, an increase in testing was the only way to determine if it had already spread to other parts of Victoria.
“If you’re sitting around any other part of Victoria thinking you’re not feeling 100 per cent, you may be part of that other new chain of transmission that we don’t have identified,’ he said. “The only way we stop these clusters is if
Scott Morrison wants “greater consistency” when it comes to border closures, but has stopped short of criticising state premiers who have slammed their borders shut in recent days.
The Prime Minister warned that states must balance “the risk of COVID and its transmission against the disruption to people”, stressing that leaders have to explain and be accountable to the public for their decisions.
New border restrictions were announced on Thursday; among them South Australia and Victoria shutting out all of NSW and Western Australia closing its border to Victorians.
In WA about 16,000 Victorians, who had arrived in the state since Monday, were suddenly forced into self isolation.
Mr Morrison also said he eagerly awaited the findings of the inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
“We’re patient and we continue to monitor the progress of that inquiry closely and support its swift conclusion,” he said.
NSW announced three new community transmission coronavirus cases on Friday, all from Western Sydney, and investigations were continuing into the source of the infections. There are 144 cases linked to the Avalon cluster.
Sydney’s northern beaches remain in lockdown, with stay- at-home rules in force.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian remains adamant the SCG can host the New Year’s Test despite new coronavirus guidelines.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has insisted the SCG can still host the New Year’s Test match, despite the growing number of coronavirus cases in Greater Sydney.
After it was revealed there were seven new cases of COVID-19 in the state today, Ms Berejiklian announced outdoor gatherings would be restricted to 2000 people from midnight on Saturday.
With the third Test match between Australia and India scheduled to commence on Thursday, it therefore seems incredibly unlikely the event could go ahead in Sydney.

However, the decision to proceed with the event has sparked significant backlash, with many social media users questioning why it was allowed to go ahead while other tough new rules have been introduced to curb the spread of the latest alarming coronavirus outbreak.
Cricket journalist Dennis Freedman tweeted: “You just can’t have a crowd at the SCG Test. It shouldn’t have gone there in the first place given the COVID issues in NSW. What a catastrophic clusterf**k all in the name of politics and $$$.
“If you attend the match, you are an arsehat putting everyone at risk.”
Masks to be made mandatory in some indoor settings in Sydney with $200 fines attached. Gym classes reduced to 30. SCG cricket match to go ahead with estimated "baseline" crowd of about 20,000 ð¤#covidnsw #WearAMask

With controlled, outdoor gatherings (seated, ticketed etc) reduced to 2,000 surely this is the death knell for the SCG test? ð pic.twitter.com/JJGBWo8Lr6
Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed at this stage, masks would not be compulsory for spectators at the SCG. However, anyone travelling to the ground via public transport would be required to wear a mask.
“Currently they are encouraged to wear masks as part of the COVID-safety plan and the messaging associated with all our events,” Dr Chant said.
“Previous events, operators handed out, for instance, masks that were in the team colours to promote it. It is important risk mitigation, but we are particularly concerned about points where people might be coming on transport because it is closed.”
On Wednesday, Dr Chant suggested sitting in the crowd at the SCG posed less risk than gathering at home.
“Bring seated outdoors poses less risk than people perhaps gathering in households to look at the Test,” she told reporters.
“This is balancing – but we have got faith in the transport plan and the work Sydney Cricket Ground has done.
“We are looking over the plans as we speak. Anyone who is unwell do not attend the Test.”
The third Test between Australia and India is scheduled to commence on Thursday.

Tony Abbott has been blasted as “disrespectful” after he was questioned – and later cleared – of flouting restrictions on Sydney’s northern beaches.
Tony Abbott has come under fire for allegedly flouting restrictions in Sydney’s northern beaches.
The former Prime Minister, who lives in the southern zone of the northern beaches, has been spotted by business owners and locals cycling and visiting a cafe in the northern half – the epicentre of the latest outbreak which is under the toughest lockdown in NSW.

Labor Senator Kristina Keneally made the revelation in a Twitter post on Thursday.
“At Church Point post office in northern beaches red zone to get our mail and a coffee today (because I live here),” she wrote.
“My neighbours and the cafe owner told me they spoke to Tony Abbott here two days ago. People are not happy. Lockdown rules only work if everyone follows them, Tony.”

Independent Warringah MP Zali Steggall, who ousted Mr Abbott from his seat in the 2019 election, described his actions as “disappointing and disrespectful”.
“Many northern beaches residents have written to me about this,” she told news.com.au.
“The lockdown and separation of the northern and southern zones of the northern beaches has come at a high cost to individuals and local businesses. It is disappointing and disrespectful to the community if Mr Abbott, a former Health Minister, has not complied with health directives to not travel between the zones.”
NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing addressed the issue during a press conference on Thursday.
Mr Willing said police had investigated the matter and found Mr Abbott was “exercising with another individual”.
“Police responded to that, spoke to the former Prime Minister and formed the view he was not in breach of the health order as it applied at that time,” he said.
“He was out for an lawful excuse exercising with another individual. That was checked and proven to be right.”
But this appears to conflict with the official directive from NSW Health.

Although residents are allowed to leave their homes for outdoor recreation activities “that supports mental, physical or emotional wellbeing”, the NSW Health website states people are not allowed to move between the two zones.
“Up to five people, including children, may gather outdoors in a public place for exercise or recreational activity (including boating), but everyone must be a northern area resident,” it says.
The rules for residents of the southern zone are similar.
“Up to 10 people, including children, may gather outdoors in a public place for exercise or recreational activity (including boating), but everyone must be a southern area resident,” it says.
Several social media users raised questions about the apparent double standard.
“Tony Abbott was investigated and not charged by NSW Police because he cycled from the southern to the northern zone of the northern beaches in the pursuit of exercise,” one Twitter user wrote.
“How stopping off for coffee fits into this is just one of many questions that arise from this.”
Another said, “My husband also saw Tony Abbott at Church Point that morning. We live in the red zone in Avalon and my husband was on an early morning ride to West Head – all within our lockdown area. Why is Tones allowed to break the rules?”
As of Thursday the Avalon cluster has reached 144 confirmed cases.
NSW Health and NSW Police have been contacted for comment.
Really don't think it was widely understood at all that you could leave your northern beaches zone for exercise. Tony Abbott did what barely anyone else contemplated
Excellent. Tony Abbott has been cleared on grounds of exercise. Now I can go up to Avalon for a surf with a mate and catch a coffee afterwards. Exercise!
According to #NSWPolice & #LNP, #TonyAbbott didnât break the health advice travelling from the south to the Northern Beaches because he was exercising. So anyone who wants to visit the North of the Northern Beaches for a NYE party bring a bike or wear joggers & Lycra & itâs cool

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/six-new-covid19-cases-in-croydon-sparks-fears-sydneys-outbreak-is-spreading-west/news-story/e9c284b2f9e8a95fb237af26699f8a82
NSW Health officials are scrambling to investigate a new cluster in Sydney’s inner west that has prompted New Year’s Eve restrictions to be further tightened.
NSW Health officials fear Sydney’s COVID-19 outbreak is spreading even further, with six new cases linked to a family at Croydon in the city’s inner west overnight.
Sydney recorded 18 new cases in the past 24 hours with nine of those linked to the northern beaches cluster.
But concerns the virus is spreading west were revealed by NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant on Wednesday, as she announced a new, unlinked cluster that has at least 34 close contacts.
“There are six cases – three adults and three children, all members of the same extended family and they're all linked to the cluster in the inner west which we’re now calling the Croydon cluster,” Dr Chant said.
“One of these cases was first reported yesterday morning, as that case had come in very late the prior night.
“We are expecting there will be additional cases linked to that cluster just because of the number of close contacts and the close household contact that a number of those contacts had over the period of Christmas and the following days.
“That Croydon family had a number of gatherings over a number of days. There were (at least) 34 close contacts.
“There are not 34 people infected; what we have announced is six. What we're saying is we know there were a lot of the interactions, a lot of household gatherings between approximately 34 close contacts.”
Dr Chant said she was most concerned that there has been no link established between the northern beaches cluster and the new mystery outbreak.
“This Croydon cluster, at this moment, we have not found a link to the northern beaches despite 24 hours of really intensive investigations,” she said.
“It's not to say we won’t, but at this stage, that is concerning. Again, this highlights the fact that COVID could be anywhere, so that is why our advice about wearing a mask maintaining social distance in an while queuing.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian stressed health officials still had the outbreak under control.
“The health advice is still such that we have a handle on the current outbreak,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“I mean, obviously the Croydon cluster is concerning because there is no established link. But all the other cases, there is some crossover with venues or regions that we have identified as a concern.
“We request people to urgently get tested. That gives us a sense of the scope and how many we're dealing with.”
There are three further locally-acquired cases still under investigation. Two cases, members of the same household, are from the Wollongong area and one is from northern Sydney.
One of the cases from Wollongong and the northern Sydney case were first reported yesterday morning.
Seven cases were acquired overseas and are in hotel quarantine.
The outbreak has forced the government to further tighten restrictions a day out from New Year’s Eve.
Indoor gatherings in greater Sydney are now limited to five per household, while outdoor gatherings have been reduced from a maximum of 50 to 30.

Cricket Australia has decided where the third Test against India will be played after COVID-19 threatened the fixture in Sydney.
Cricket Australia has decided the third Test between Australia and India will go ahead at the SCG despite concerns about the threat of COVID-19.
A recent outbreak in Sydney forced CA to consider contingency plans that may have seen the players remain in Melbourne to play a second match in a row at the MCG.
However, Sydneysiders desperate to see some live Test cricket can breathe a sigh of relief after the call was made to plough ahead with the initial plan, which is scheduled to see the third Test kick off in the Harbour City on January 7.

A coronavirus outbreak in Sydney’s northern beaches saw people living in that area forced into a strict lockdown and the virus has since spread to other parts of the city.
On Tuesday NSW recorded three new cases which were identified in hotel quarantine and acquired overseas, and three other cases not linked to the Avalon cluster. Because more potential hot spots have emerged and there is mystery surrounding the origin of several COVID-19 cases, the state is remaining on high alert.
It meant the traditional New Year’s fixture at the SCG was at risk of being moved but CA confirmed late on Tuesday night Sydney will still host the third Test.

RELATED: Warne calls for Aussies to swing the axe
Acting CA CEO Nick Hockley said the decision to play in Sydney — and keep the fourth Test in Brisbane on the schedule — was made after discussions with the NSW and Queensland governments.
“We have met regularly over the past week to assess the unfolding public health situation in Sydney and gauge its impact on border restrictions around the country,” Hockley said. “To date, we have been able to deliver a safe and successful summer thanks to our detailed biosecurity protocols and the amazing work of so many great people behind the scenes.
“We are confident that both this match, and the fourth Test in Brisbane, will play out in a safe and successful manner and thus round out what has been a magnificent men’s international program this summer.
“We are very grateful to the New South Wales and Queensland Governments for their willingness to work with us to deliver the series as planned in a manner that places the safety and wellbeing of the players, officials, staff and the wider community as its top priority.
“In response to the public health situation in NSW and the requirements of the Queensland Government, CA will put in place appropriate biosecurity measures and we thank all players, staff and broadcasters for their co-operation to play the matches safely.”
The Queensland border is closed to Sydneysiders, leading to suggestions Australian and Indian players might need to isolate while only being allowed out to train ahead of the fourth Test in Brisbane.
Before the decision to play in Sydney was confirmed, Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said: “We have had a number of discussions with Cricket Australia and they (the teams) would need to follow the same arrangements that we’ve had in place for other sporting codes when they travel from a hotspot.
“I’ve just made clear what would need to occur if they were to play in Sydney and Sydney was still regarded as a hot spot at that time. Because that’s not even certain, of course.”

Victoria recorded its 60th straight day without any new coronavirus cases, but Melbourne is enforcing a strict rule on New Year’s Eve.
Despite recording 60 straight days without any new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, Victorians are being urged to stay away from the CBD on New Year’s Eve unless they have a booking at a hospitality venue.
The strict rule – similar to a measure Sydney put into place after the northern beaches cluster exploded just before Christmas – was announced on Tuesday by Acting Premier Jacinta Allan.
Speaking on behalf of Daniel Andrews who is taking a break, she told reporters the health advice was for people “only who have a booking at a hospitality venue” to venture into Melbourne’s CBD on Thursday evening.
“We have now seen how our hospitality venues have really strong COVID-safe practices in place … and that’s a really important way of helping with the testing and tracing should there be a case,” Ms Allan said.
“That’s why we’re wanting to see only people with bookings come in and out of the city.
“Other movement, we know, can cause risk of transmission, and particularly with the situation being so active in NSW, we want to make sure that we can minimise the risk here in Victoria and Melbourne.”
Victoria recorded its 60th straight day without any new coronavirus cases on Tuesday.
Ms Allan said it was a “strong result” and urged Victorians not to go out and celebrate on New Year’s Eve if they had symptoms.
“Do not go out and celebrate New Year’s Eve if you have symptoms because it is only going to contribute to the spread of the virus,” she said.
“Even if you are on holidays and you do have symptoms, please do get tested at one of those 60 testing sites around Victoria … it is all part of keeping the community safe and holding on to those precious gains of no known local community transmission.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian banned any gatherings in Sydney Harbour on New Year’s Eve, with current COVID-19 restrictions to continue beyond December 30.
“You cannot come to the CBD on New Year’s Eve unless you have a booking from a hospitality venue. But even if you have a booking, you have to get a permit through Service NSW to prove you got that booking,” she said.
“You cannot just, unfortunately, pick up and go along to those frequently attended venues without a controlled and ticketed event.”
Only people with a New Year’s Eve pass from Service NSW will be allowed to enter designated zones around Circular Quay, North Sydney and the City.

Guests at a Sydney wedding reception have received huge fines for breaching public health orders.
A dozen guests at a Sydney wedding reception have received $1000 fines for breaching COVID-19 directions.
Police were called to a venue on Pirrama Road in Pyrmont about 5pm on Sunday after receiving a tip-off from Crime Stoppers about possible breaches of a public health order.
Officers recorded contact details for more than a dozen guests, who are Northern Beaches residents, and after inquiries with NSW Health, issued $1000 penalty infringement notices.
Those fined include a man and woman, both aged 43, from Allambie Heights, a 33-year-old Narraweena woman, a 27-year-old Frenchs Forest man, as well as three women, aged 19, 22 and 28, and two men, aged 23 and 63, all from Beacon Hill.
Police say a further three fines are expected to be issued to a 34-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman, both from Frenchs Forest, and a 26-year-old man from Beacon Hill.
A local resident who filmed the wedding alleged the venue “never follows the rules”.
“It’s ironic this venue is on a wharf,” said the resident, who did not wish to be named.
“Will it be the next Ruby Princess?”
Inquiries are continuing, with police appealing to the community to report suspected breaches of ministerial directions or behaviour that may affect others’ health and safety.
Anyone with information about COVID-19-related breaches is urged to contact Crime Stoppers.

Despite a growing cluster, residents in this coronavirus-plagued Sydney suburb are allowed access to public playgrounds and beaches.
NSW northern beaches residents are allowed to attend playgrounds and public beaches under a new COVID-19 exemption, despite a growing virus cluster.
It comes as the state recorded seven new locally acquired infections on Sunday, with all but one linked to the cluster.
The rule change, which comes into effect immediately, allows people to enjoy outdoor exercise.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard signed the exemption to the Public Health (COVID-19 Northern Beaches) Order 2020 on Sunday.
It means residents from the northern beaches can use public outdoor playground equipment and natural swimming pools, and brings the area’s restrictions in-line with the rest NSW.
Adults from different households must maintain 1.5m apart from one another and all residents from the northern beaches must continue to comply with the public health order in place.
A natural swimming pool under the exemption contains untreated water from the ocean or other natural water sources and does not have a circulation system.
After a three-day reprieve over Christmas, residents from the area have returned to lockdown and can only leave home for one of four reasons.
Those from the region are only permitted to leave home for work or education, essential shopping, exercise and for health or compassionate care.
The changes come into effect as the number of cases linked to the Avalon cluster increased to 122.
On Sunday, health authorities said they were investigating five cases of COVID-19 that have no known source.

After being stood down without pay, hotel manager Joshua Dows was called back to manage the quarantine program at Sheraton Grand Sydney Hyde Park.
Joshua Dows remembers going to breakfast at Altitude Bar in the Shangri-La Hotel Sydney one day in March and being confronted with staff wearing masks and taking guests’ temperatures.
Later that day he was on Balmoral Beach when it was closed and people were told to head home because of COVID-19.
The next day, the food and beverage manager at Sheraton Grand Sydney Hyde Park was given the news he will never forget – to close all the hotel’s bars and restaurants, after which he was stood down without pay.
A week later, the hotel entered the quarantine program, accepting guests off international flights who were forced into 14-day hotel isolation, and Dows was called back to help manage the operations change.
He was nominated in our Thanks a Million campaign by his brother Matthew for his quick-thinking ability to make fast and drastic changes at the hotel.
To qualify as a quarantine hotel, the Sheraton Grand had to be able to provide isolating guests with three meals a day and manage the logistics of using single-use plates and cutlery, along with getting meals to 565 rooms as they were operating at full capacity.
“I never thought it was possible to just close all restaurants and bars, it was unlike any situation we had ever experienced,” Queensland-born Dows, 33, said.
“When we closed down the restaurants and bars, it was like an opening, but in reverse.”
New legislation was later introduced to allow places that could satisfactorily separate quarantine guests from regular guests, the ability to open their restaurants and bars to the public.
“We literally built a makeshift wall on level two to keep quarantine guests separate from the public,” Dows said.
“And due to this we were able to keep up to 70 per cent of the food and beverage team employed.”
The hotel went above and beyond implementing activities to keep their quarantined guests occupied in interesting ways.
They introduced virtual wine tasting experiences, in-room fitness programs and Zoom yoga, to name a few.
At the end of their 14-day stay, guests received a quarantine certificate to mark their historic time at the hotel.

CHRISTMAS LUNCH BRINGS CHEER TO DISADVANTAGED AUSTRALIANS
Goodwill and good times made Christmas a special day across Sydney as disadvantaged Australians gathered for some festive cheer at a special takeaway lunch hosted by The Rev. Bill Crews Foundation at Ashfield.
And there was no shortage of goodwill from volunteers.
The bakery team at Woolworths in Ashfield supplied 1500 Santa choc chip cookies (320 packs of five) made specially for the annual lunch.
Host Bill Crews said the event was a special way to spread festive cheer and support struggling Australians who couldn’t afford to put food on the table.
“I’d like to thank Woolworths for the help they’ve given us and the special cookies they have baked for our Christmas Day lunch and special food hampers,” he said.
The Rev. Bill Crews Foundation gives free meals, support and hope to thousands of homeless, poor and disadvantaged Australians every week.
This Christmas, the team assembled 1500 emergency food hampers for guests and key frontline crisis agencies as well as prepared for a Christmas Day takeaway lunch in coordination with NSW Health.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared this Australia Day as our national day of thanks following a tumultuous 12 months. Find out what is being said in your state.

A woman who arrived in Qld on a superyacht before a positive virus test has angered police, as nobody on board will say where they’ve been.
Queensland health authorities have slammed the managers of a superyacht who entered Australian waters with an infected crew member on board and refused to reveal vital information about where it had been.
The state’s health minister Yvette D’Ath said those responsible for the crew have been referred to the police while the infected staff member, a woman in her 20s, was placed in quarantine.
“We will leave that for the police to deal with, but we are very disappointed they are not co-operating and providing factual and correct information to the Queensland Police,” she told reporters on Thursday.
Dr Young said the guest passengers on the superyacht had been moved into quarantine, but six crew members remained on the boat to keep it safe.
“We are now testing those six crew and ensuring that none of them have COVID-19,” she said.
“The superyacht originated in the Maldives and then came to Cairns, so we are trying to work through with them how it got onto that yacht.”
Dr Young said the infection should serve as a warning that the virus can survive and thrive among a small crew of people regardless of he time spent at ocean.
The infection is one of two new cases reported in Queensland on Thursday, with the other being a man who had recently visited the northern beaches.
The man in his 40s, who lives in Queensland’s south east, had been in the Sydney region at the time the deadly pandemic was spreading through the community.
When he returned home to the Sunshine State, he had a test on December 18 which was negative. But he remained in isolation and later returned a positive result after feeling unwell.
“I want to say thank you to that gentleman, he has done everything right since coming back into Queensland,” Ms D’Ath said.
“He has been isolating himself in quarantine at home, which has significantly reduced any risk of spreading this to other people and this is the gold standard of what we expect of anyone who has travelled from the northern beaches.”
The man was not one of the 53 people NSW Health had recommended to their Queensland counterparts as a likely contacts to the cluster, which chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said should serve as a warning for anyone who visited the northern beaches to be proactive with testing and isolation.
“Don’t wait for a text message from NSW that you are a close contact from someone on the northern beaches,” she said.
“If you have been in the northern beaches you have been asked to go into home quarantine up until just recently when (we announced) everyone goes into hotel quarantine, you must absolutely stay in the home quarantine and should not have contact with anyone else, and you should not have visitors to your house.”
Thursday marked 100 days without any locally acquired cases of coronavirus in Queensland.

All close contacts of a 15-year-old Victorian girl who contracted COVID-19 while holidaying in Sydney have tested negative for the virus.
Victoria’s testing commander Jeroen Weimar on Wednesday confirmed that two people who were living in the same house as the girl did not appear to have the disease or become infectious.
They will still be required to isolate for 14 days but the results means that there are no high-risk exposure sites for Victoria and that secondary contacts will no longer need to quarantine.
The girls mother, who travelled with her on the car trip back from Sydney to the Moonee Valley local government area, has also tested negative.
Mr Weimar said the results were welcome news but urged all Victorians to remain vigilant, particularly those on permits returning from NSW.
He said the girl may not have infected others because of the virus’ incubation period.
“People are not equally infectious to other people,” he said.
“It may well be entirely possible that this girl continues her infectious cycle and that nobody else in the household contracts COVID-19.”
Mr Weimar said there would be as many as 60 testing sites open over Christmas and Boxing Day, but that local GPs and other smaller venues may not have regular opening hours.
“The virus doesn’t stop for Christmas, we don’t stop for Christmas,” he said.
“If you’ve got symptoms on Christmas Day, go and get tested on Christmas Day.”
Police have turned away more than 100 vehicles trying to enter Victoria without valid permits.
About 700 Victoria Police officers are guarding the Victorian/NSW border to prevent the NSW’s coronavirus cluster from spreading into Victoria.
A total of 102 vehicles have been barred from entering Victoria since the border security operation began midnight Sunday.
The permits allow people in NSW’s “green zone” to enter Victoria.
Those who visited Greater Sydney or the Central Coast since December 11 are no longer able to return to Victoria without completing 14 days mandatory hotel quarantine.
New South Wales has recorded eight cases of local transmission in NSW overnight, seven linked to the Avalon cluster.
The state’s premier Gladys Berejiklian also revealed how people in Sydney will be allowed to celebrate Christmas amid the city’s coronavirus outbreak.
Sydneysiders will be allowed to have Christmas with up to 10 family and friends at home under new coronavirus restrictions announced on Wednesday, not including children.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced “modest changes” to Sydney’s coronavirus restrictions over the Christmas period.
From Christmas Eve until Boxing Day residents in greater Sydney will be able to have 10 people over to their home plus children aged under 12.
After Boxing Day the restrictions will revert back to 10 people in a home including children under 12.
Residents in the northern region of the northern beaches can have five other people from the same region in their homes.
Residents in the southern region of the northern beaches will be able to have 10 people in their homes. They cannot leave the area but people will be able to visit from greater Sydney.
Ms Berejiklian said on December 27 the restrictions would revert back to the current lockdown provisions.
A communication bungle in which multiple people who visited a testing site in Melbourne over the past week were told to isolate over Christmas and New Years has been identified by authorities.
Several people who visited the hospital for a test were texted on Wednesday morning informing them they were close contacts of a positive case and needed to isolate, even if their test had come back negative.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the issue on Wednesday morning.
“We have received reports that a number of people with a negative COVID-19 test result may have received a text message from a metro Melbourne hospital informing them that they need to isolate for 14 days,” the spokesman said.
“We have followed up with this hospital to correct the messaging error, and they have confirmed they will send a follow-up SMS with the right instructions.”
The spokeswoman apologised for the inconvenience.
It comes as 4296 people applied for exemption permits to leave the Greater Sydney area and return to Victoria on Sunday.
A total of 35 people have been detained for returning from the red zone by air without exemption permits
The 15-year-old Moonee Valley girl who contracted coronavirus has been tested twice and both tests have been positive.
She was asymptomatic at time of first test but now has symptoms
Victoria reported just one new internationally case of coronavirus on Wednesday.
A whopping 22,956 Victorians were tested for the virus on Tuesday.
Victorian authorities remain on high alert after a Melbourne teenager tested positive to COVID-19 after visiting a Sydney hot spot last week, prompting a warning that the pandemic was “far from over”.
The 15-year-old girl tested positive on Monday while in isolation after driving home to the Moonee Valley area with her mother on December 18.
About 300 people already in Victoria have been in close contact with the Sydney cluster and are awaiting their test results.
Department of Health and Human Services testing commander Jeroen Weimar said he expected that number would grow.
“These are people who we know have been in the red zone or the amber zone and who we are continuing to pursue in terms of testing results and isolation requirements,” he said.
“I expect that number to grow over the coming days as we get test results for remaining returning travellers.”
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said “leakage” from the NSW cluster was to be expected and urged people to get tested.
“Given the large size of the outbreak in NSW, it is not unexpected that we would experience some localised cases in Victoria,” he said.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley warned the pandemic was “not over by a long shot” after the positive case interrupted a 53-day streak.
“We should take this as a really significant lesson that this is not over,” Mr Foley said.
“We need to work hard every day between now and when every Australian is vaccinated to keep us all safe.”
He said there were “many, many” people who had re-entered Melbourne from Sydney exposure sites.
Questions remain over whether any close contacts of the positive girl may have been infected and visited locations in Victoria.
Mr Weimar said authorities were still working through the details, with the teen’s mother the greatest risk of infection but already having returned a negative result.
A mutated form of the coronavirus has been found in Victoria, sparking concerns over arrivals from England.
The two cases were picked up in returned travellers in hotel quarantine, along with another two cases in NSW.
The UK COVID-19 variant – believed to up to 70 per cent more contagious – has sparked widespread border closures across the world.
But chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the altered virus was, at this stage, largely a “concern in the UK” and the Australian hotel quarantine system should be trusted.
“Here in Australia, we have our ways of dealing with people coming from overseas in terms of our hotel quarantine system … that has been extremely effective in controlling any virus that may be coming from other parts of the world,” he said.
“We put faith in that.”
Australia’s peak body of medical experts – the AHPPC – met on Tuesday to discuss the developments.
“Four cases with this variant have been documented in Australia, two in NSW and Victoria respectively at this time,” they said in a statement on Tuesday evening.
“All cases have been or are being managed in hotel quarantine and the variant has not spread into the community.
“Australia has a world-class system for genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 to be able to detect occurrence of this variant. “
Hundreds of police, including homicide and counter terror detectives, cancelled Christmas plans to guard Victoria from NSW’s growing coronavirus outbreak.
About 700 Victoria Police officers have been deployed to 31 checkpoints along the NSW-Victorian border.
All vehicles — except freight vehicles — will be checked by police and those without a valid permit or who have visited Greater Sydney or the Central Coast will be refused entry to the state.
Deputy Commissioner Rick Nugent said the operation was crucial in protecting Victoria from another COVID-19 outbreak.
“This is a significant community safety challenge for us. None of us want to go into stage four lockdown again,” he said.
So far 12 people without permits have been turned away at border checkpoints, and three were arrested for burglary and drunk driving matters.
Police from across the force, including specialist officers and cadets, will patrol the borders, with assistance by the SES, CFA and DEWLP.
The Australian Defence Force declined its support, unlike during Victoria’s second wave where troops made up the metropolitan “ring of steel”.
Many police gave up their holidays to guard the Victorian-NSW border, with some required to sleep in tents due to the lack of available accommodation over the busy holiday period.
Mr Nugent said: “Many of them will be sleeping in tents. Many of them will be foregoing Christmas functions, family functions to be down there.”
The top cop conceded policing in Victoria would be impacted by the snap border enforcement operation. However he said was confident there would be no compromise to public safety.

Confusion surrounding new quarantine rules in South Australia left many travellers waiting hours at Adelaide Airport on Sunday December 20. According to local news reports, New South Wales arrivals were told they had to return to Sydney or enter 14 days’ quarantine, despite landing hours before South Australia’s midnight border closure. On Monday December 21, the state’s police commissioner reportedly apologised for the errors, saying authorities were still “trying to find out where the breakdown in communication came about.” The midnight border closure in South Australia is one of many new restrictions introduced by states across Australia to prevent the interstate spread of a COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney’s Northern Beaches region, first reported on December 16, and an increase of cases in Greater Sydney.

Nash Rawiller was among four jockeys stood down after travelling to NSW but a negative test means he will be back in the saddle at Sandown.
Group 1-winning jockey Nash Rawiller will be back in the saddle at Sandown on Wednesday after tests cleared him of COVID-19 on Tuesday morning.
Rawiller, among four hoops stood down on Friday after travelling to New South Wales, has four rides for the meeting and joins Craig Williams, who also returned a negative result.
“I wasn’t at any stage concerned,” Rawiller said.
“I did the right things while I was up there (Sydney) and was nowhere near where it (coronavirus outbreak) was.”
He will ride early favourite Narvaez in the second at Sandown, and then Collectable in the fifth, Laundy in the seventh and Helavabel in the last.
A cutaway rail is to be trialled by Melbourne Racing Club at the meeting and it will also be adopted for the Lakeside track on January 6.
Feedback will determine if the club proceeds with the cutaway rail in the winter.
Rawiller has also picked up a handy ride on Saturday, replacing his son, apprentice Campbell, on Gold Fields in the Listed Lord Stakes at Caulfield.
Leading jockey Damien Oliver will miss the Sandown meeting, but has been booked for the ride on Pandemic in the Christmas Stakes over 1200m on Saturday, although trainer James Cummings has yet to decide if the four-year will run.
Pandemic, a last-start winner at Rosehill on December 5 when ridden by James McDonald, is still in Sydney and Cummings was still weighing up the options before acceptances on Wednesday morning.
But Pakenham trainer Phillip Stokes has declared quality sprinter Samson in “good order” as he chases a hat-trick of wins in the Listed Christmas Stakes.
“The horse is going great,” Stokes said.
“He had a freshen up since he won a stakes race on the last day of the (Spring) carnival.
“He worked well this morning, had a jump out. He is fit and well and goes into the race in good order.”
Samson conquered South Australian Parsifal over 1200m at Moonee Valley on October 23 and then beat home another two SA sprinters Morvada and Bold Star after leading throughout in the Chatham Stakes over 1400m at Flemington on November 7.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/breaking-news/kyle-daniels-how-mosman-swim-coachs-seven-week-sex-abuse-trial-ended-in-covid19-chaos-and-a-hung-jury/news-story/dd1ec4b505ba57a0d41bd010bbe54712
The full story of the jury issues that took place in the trial of former Mosman swim teacher Kyle Daniels can be revealed after they failed to reach a verdict.
It had been just 90 minutes when the jury sent the first note.
“It’s not without complexity,” District Court Judge Kara Shead said to the tense, sparsely populated courtroom.
“The note indicates disagreement strongly that will not be resolved.”
The note, and the deep divisions it exposed, was an early, worrying sign all was not well in the jury room at the trial of Kyle Daniels.
It had begun nearly two months earlier, on October 28, at the Downing Centre court complex in Sydney’s CBD.
Mr Daniels, 22, stood accused of sexually abusing nine young girls as he taught them at Mosman Swim Centre on Sydney’s affluent North Shore between February 2018 and February 2019.
The young swim instructor pleaded not guilty to 26 charges and has consistently denied the allegations.
During the trial, the eight men and four women of the jury watched prerecorded evidence from the nine girls and heard from their parents, swim school staff, police, experts, and Mr Daniels himself.
Prosecutor Karl Prince argued Mr Daniels was driven by a sexual interest in his students, brazenly touching them for his own sexual gratification despite the high risk of getting caught.
He urged the jury to find there was no coincidence in the similar stories of the nine young girls.
Mr Daniels remained unflustered as he was cross-examined by Mr Prince, calmly and emphatically denying the numerous allegations against him.
Defence barrister Leslie Nicholls attacked the Crown case from multiple directions, honing in on inconsistencies and errors in the girls’ stories.
He sought to paint a picture of a police investigation that targeted Mr Daniels from the moment of his arrest, taking particular aim at the officer in charge, Detective Senior Constable Emma Lay.
The trial overshot the estimated 5-6 weeks, prompting concerns as time went on that the jury may enter their deliberations feeling pressured for time.
As the Christmas period loomed, marked by the annual Downing Centre nativity scene appearing in the lobby, Judge Shead extended the court’s sitting hours.
The jury finally went out to deliberate at approximately 9.15am on Thursday December 17, the 34th day of the trial.
As Mr Daniels stood and watched the jury exit to decide his fate, he slowly fastened the two buttons of his suit jacket, as he did every time they entered or exited.
The note landed with a thud 90 minutes later.
According to Judge Shead, it had simply not been long enough.
In the jury’s absence, she said: “The views are strongly expressed, but this is a seven week trial.”
Before long, there was a second note. It said verdicts had been reached on five charges, but the jurors remained at an unassailable stalemate on the others.
The foreman handed down the five verdicts: all acquittals, clearing Mr Daniels of half the alleged incidents described by one of the girls.
He was acquitted of four counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and one alternative count of indecent assault.
Mr Daniels closed his eyes and nodded slightly as each “Not guilty” rang through the silent courtroom.
But everyone in court knew the bulk of the charges remained.
By Thursday afternoon, a third note arrived: “With all due respect we are at a deadlock and no amount of time would result in a different outcome.”
The three notes, all in different handwriting, were expressed with “vehemence”, Judge Shead said.
Mr Prince said he was concerned jurors were frustrated and asking them to continue ran the risk of people being pressured into a result just to get out of the room.
Judge Shead urged the jury to keep trying — a female juror nodding her head in agreement as she did so — before sending them home early for the day.
But when court resumed on Friday morning, the deadlock was not the only problem facing the trial.
First, a juror was missing. One of the 12 was stuck in the Northern Beaches COVID-19 lockdown and NSW Health had made clear jurors were not exempt.
Second, a different juror had a flight leaving NSW that evening.
Deliberations ground to a halt for the day as Mr Prince, Mr Nicholls, and Judge Shead tried to figure out what to do.
The juror with the flight — the woman who nodded as they were urged to keep going — was discharged; the rest sent home in the hope the lockdown might be short lived.
By Monday morning, it was obvious it would not be.
By then, Sydney was fully in the throes of a concerning virus cluster.
Everyone donned a mask for court, including Judge Shead, lawyers, jurors, and the Daniels family, who reside in the lockdown zone.
The second juror, still stuck on the beaches, was discharged in his absence, leaving just 10 to continue deliberations.
This eliminated the possibility of a majority verdict, leaving a unanimous decision as the only option.
An hour and a half later, another note arrived: “I was wondering if we could get an alternative or further explanation of beyond reasonable doubt.”
The High Court has barred judges from explaining the concept of reasonable doubt, which is the standard of proof in criminal cases.
Juries are directed they can only convict a person if convinced beyond reasonable doubt they are guilty.
Judge Shead simply told the jurors it is “an expression that means what it says”.
“You should apply the ordinary everyday meaning of those words,” she said. “It is for you to decide whether you are left with a reasonable doubt.”
A male juror shook his head with frustration as she spoke.
An hour later, the fourth and last note advising of a deadlock arrived.
Judge Shead described it as “expressing in considered and absolute terms that there is no prospect of agreement”.
Mr Prince and Mr Nicholls reluctantly agreed there was now no option but to let the jury go.
It is the third high profile case to end in a hung jury in the past month.
There were hung juries in the unrelated sexual assault trials recently faced by St George Illawarra Dragons player Jack de Belin in Wollongong and former Parramatta Eels player Jarryd Hayne in Newcastle.
Both are expected to face a retrial in Sydney next year.
Jeremy Gans, a professor at Melbourne Law School who has written a book about juries, said the series of high profile hung juries “might be a total coincidence”.
If it’s not, he has two theories: one, prosecutors are pursuing more difficult, less clear-cut cases; and two, jurors or potential jurors may be more aware of cases in which a verdict is not reached, affecting their discussions.
“The hope that the legal system has is that jurors will initially start off split but will eventually, through long discussion or argument, get to the right result by convincing one side or the other that they’re wrong,” he said.
“It’s possible that gets undermined when jurors hear that earlier juries have split. That they think ‘well, maybe I should stick to my guns too’.”
Despite the recent spate of hung juries, Mr Gans said in his view there is no obvious upside to sexual abuse matters being heard by judges alone.
“If I had to choose, I’d say the opposite,” he said. “We’re down to calls of credibility, and there’s no reason judges are better at that than jurors.”
Judge Shead said to the 10 remaining jurors as she discharged them: “I know that must be perhaps for some of you, or all of you, a relief.”
She thanked them for their service, particularly in light of the lengthy trial, the Christmas period, and the COVID-19 outbreak.
She explained that at any retrial the evidence of the nine complainants, already prerecorded, would simply be replayed, the young girls not required to testify a second time.
And she directed the jurors to counselling support, saying: “Trials like this, with this sort of subject matter, can be difficult.”
Mr Daniels again buttoned his jacket as he watched the jury depart for the last time, his peers unable to agree on a verdict.
He and his family, as well as Constable Lay and prosecutors, all left court stony-faced, the unenviable prospect of a long retrial laid bare before them as they ran the gauntlet of cameras for the last time in 2020.
The matter will return to court in February 2021.

As air travel borders shut down early in South Australia on Sunday, so too did the roads, with police admitting 100 people were incorrectly turned away.
South Australia’s border bungle forced about 100 travellers, who drove for hours from New South Wales, to turn back after a “miscommunication” of instructions at checkpoints.
Under recent border restrictions, announced on Sunday, those from the Greater Sydney area could enter SA without quarantining up until midnight last night.
But, many travellers were told otherwise when they arrived prior to the 12am deadline, causing mass confusion at Adelaide Airport and road checkpoints.
Many people were incorrectly given the option to return to NSW or quarantine in SA for 14 days.
Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said there was some “miscommunication” in the process of communicating the new directions between authorities, which led to the incorrect instructions being given to border control teams.
“This obviously has had a significant impact on certain travellers, he said.
“That anomaly was identified at about 9.30pm last night and correct information was given to our border control teams.
“We obviously regret the inconvenience and disruption that this has caused people who were affected by the incorrect advice being provided to our checkpoints.”
Mr Stevens, who is also the state coordinator, said there were about 100 people who presented at the road border who decided to turn back to NSW.
There are also about 550 people who are currently quarantining and will be directly contacted by SA Police with advice on if they need to quarantine or not.
“The majority of those people will be allowed to leave quarantine immediately, but they must wait until they are spoken to by police,” Mr Stevens said.
“The reason for this is because some of those people have been in the northern beaches area, and they will still be required to quarantine for 14 days having come into SA before midnight last night.
“This is a very unfortunate set of circumstances at a very unfortunate time of the year when people are travelling to spend Christmas with their families.
“We apologise for the inconvenience but we ask people appreciate that this is exceptionally difficult work undertaken by a team of people doing their very best to protect SA from COVID-19.”
Health Minister Stephen Wade said travellers seeking compensation over the debacle could contact SA Health.
It is understood their travel costs, which would need to be supplied as proof of purchase, would be reimbursed and would be considered on a “case-by-case basis”.
“People who believe they're entitled to compensation can make contact with SA Health,” Mr Wade said.
SA recorded no new COVID-19 infections on Monday, and currently has three active cases which are all repatriated Australians in hotel quarantine.

Cricket Australia remains hopeful the SCG Test match can go ahead despite the recent coronavirus outbreak in Sydney’s northern beaches.
Cricket Australia remains hopeful the third Test match between Australia and India at the SCG can go ahead despite the recent coronavirus outbreak in Sydney’s northern beaches.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New South Wales climbed to 71 this weekend, prompting Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews the shut the border to New South Wales from midnight on Sunday.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian also announced new lockdown restrictions for Greater Sydney as the northern beaches cluster continues to spread.
The third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is scheduled to commence on January 7th. Despite suggestions the five-day fixture should be played at the MCG or Canberra’s Manuka Oval, CA interim chief executive Nick Hockley confirmed the SCG remains the preferred venue.
“The third Vodafone Test is more than two-and-a-half weeks away, which provides us with time to assess the evolving public health situation on the northern beaches of Sydney,” Hockley said in a statement.
“We have made no changes to our schedule and our preference remains to play the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
“Cricket Australia has developed a solid track record of delivery throughout this most challenging of summers and will continue to make appropriate and proportionate decisions in consultation with our biosecurity team, governments, State & Territory Associations, the Australian Cricketers’ Association, our partners and venues.
“CA has prepared for the possibility of COVID-19 hotspots and state border closures over the course of the summer and the protocols that we have put in place have been effective in ensuring the safety and success of the men’s and women’s domestic and international programs to date.
“It was less than a month ago that South Australians were contending with an outbreak of the virus in Adelaide and we have just completed a brilliant first Vodafone Test at the Adelaide Oval. We faced similar issues in relation to the Melbourne Cricket Ground playing host to the Boxing Day Test and we are now less than a week away from welcoming back Victorian crowds after a difficult year for the state.
“We will continue to work closely with all relevant parties to make the right decisions in the appropriate timeframes.”
Australian pace bowler Pat Cummins said the players had been discussing the ongoing COVID-19 situation throughout the day-night Test in Adelaide.
“Fingers crossed it doesn’t escalate too much,” Cummins told reporters.
“Cricket Australia have been amazing with our medical staff – they’ve thought of every contingency and are red-hot on our discipline with mask-wearing and isolation with people coming into the bubble.
“Fingers crossed Sydney can look after themselves.”
On Saturday, Australia secured a sensational eight-wicket victory over India in series opener at Adelaide Oval.
The Test squad will travel to Melbourne this week for the second Test, which will commence on Boxing Day.
As the Australian public awaits the coronavirus vaccine rollout, some of the country’s top cricketers may soon get the jab in India.

‘Reg’ the seal was seen enjoying an afternoon of peace and quiet at Sydney, Australia’s popular Dee Why Beach as a COVID-19 outbreak forced many residents into quarantine during mid-December. There were 38 cases of the virus as of 8 pm on December 18, New South Wales (NSW) Health reported. This was after two cases were first reported in the Northern Beaches region on December 16. A stay-at-home advisory was to be enforced across the area while hospitality venues and function centres would be ordered to close as of 5 pm on December 19, NSW Health said. Residents carrying out essential activities were told to wear masks indoors while virus testing was ramped up across the region. However, the encircling crisis fell on deaf ears when it came to ‘Reg’ the seal, affectionately named by locals, who could be seen relaxing in the damp weather as a double rainbow stretched overhead.

Hundreds of northern beaches residents have been told to self isolate after two gyms in the area had a positive coronavirus case.
Hundreds of people on Sydney’s northern beaches have been told to undergo COVID-19 testing and self-isolate after a positive case visited an Avalon gym.
NSW Health on Saturday issued a health alert after the person visited Anytime Fitness at Avalon over several days last week.
Anyone who visited the Avalon Parade gym on December 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12 has been asked get tested and isolate immediately.
The gym has closed for cleaning until further notice.
It was one two gyms NSW Health named as venues of concern because of the northern beaches region outbreak after Fitness First, Mona Vale was added to the list on Saturday.
Anyone who visited the Fitness First centre on December 13, 14 and 16 has been asked to get tested immediately and isolate.
Other new venues of concern are 4 Pines, Newport (December 15),  Sunset Diner, Avalon Beach (December 11) and  Café Relish, Avalon Beach (December 17).
NSW Health said that due to the large length of the exposure, there were hundreds of people who were potential contacts.
“Can I acknowledge the great cooperation of that gym owner in providing data last night for us,” NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said.
“We will be contacting people that went to that gym.”
It comes as restaurants and bars on Sydney’s coronavirus-gripped northern beaches have begun voluntarily closing their doors as authorities attempt to stem a rapidly growing outbreak in the area.
Less than a week out from Christmas, restrictions have put in place for the northern beaches after the Avalon cluster on Saturday ballooned by 23 to a total of 38 total cases.
NSW Health has issued alerts for venues right across Sydney and Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned that unless the rise in new cases can be stemmed, further restrictions could be implemented for all of greater Sydney.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard, whose Wakehurst electorate takes in part of the northern beaches, took to social media to thank local businesses for closing to help stop the outbreak, noting pubs had elected to shut their doors voluntarily.
Mr Hazzard went on to say that some cafes and restaurants had also made the tough decision to close their doors.
“The Hotel Association has voluntarily asked its hotels on the northern beaches to close for the next few days and they’ve done that voluntarily,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“It’s wonderful to see them come forward and make that offer to us in a bid to get this virus under control because we know if we work hard in the next few days, we have a better chance of making sure we don’t limit activity moving forward.”
14 of 17  pubs on Northern Beaches are closed or will close 4  the weekend VOLUNTARILY. Most churches/ houses of Worship have advised â¦@NSWHealthâ© they will close this weekend. Thank u 2 Northern  Beaches community  4 response to the Avalon Cluster outbreak! Amazing pic.twitter.com/Zpj7p6eBPm
I am now hearing some cafes, restaurants as well as some clubs have closed to assist @NSWHealth and Dr Chantâs Public Health team get on top of the COVID-19 outbreak . This on top of churches and pubs closing. I am just so grateful.
The Merivale Group, which operates an empire of over 60 venues across Sydney, said it was closing its northern beaches venues The Newport, Bert’s, The Collaroy and Queen Chow Manly.
All of NSW is on high alert following the swell in new cases, with residents from all of Sydney told to get tested if they display even minor symptoms.
A total of 21 Sydney beaches have been closed on the city’s northern beaches, with residents from the region advised to stay indoors.
Further alerts were issued on Saturday and include several bus routes. Anyone on the routes below are considered close contacts and must isolate and get tested:
Route B1-1, December 14, Departing Warriewood BLine, Pittwater Rd 6.55am, arriving Wynyard Station, York Street Stand M, 7.50am
Route B1-2, December 14, Departing Wynyard Station Stand B 5.45pm, arriving Warriewood BLine, Pittwater Rd, 6.40pm

Route B1-2, December 16, Departing Wynyard Station Stand B 4.45pm, arriving Warriewood BLine, Pittwater Rd, 5.30pm
Anyone who attended Nick Scali at the SuperCentre in Belrose on December 16 between 10am and 5:30pm is considered a casual contact and must monitor symptoms, get tested and isolate until they get their result.
COVID alerts have been issued for venues in Darling Point, Rosebery, Penrith, Cronulla, Kirribilli, Lane Cove, Turramurra and Woolloomooloo, amid a fear it could spread to other areas.
Health officials on the Central Coast have confirmed a local resident has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and they are self-isolating at their home.
The case has been linked to the northern beaches cluster.
They travelled on a ferry from Palm Beach to Wagstaffe on Wednesday evening and all other people on the 6.15pm ferry have been advised to undergo testing and self-isolate until a negative result is received.
Its has thrown Christmas travel plans into disarray for thousands after several states imposed fresh travel restrictions.
Northern beaches residents are banned from entering Victoria, while anyone from the region must undergo 14 days of self-isolation after entering Queensland.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/covid19-sydney-21-beaches-closed-as-city-grapples-with-virus-outbreak/news-story/d1ff1c3586a64b3a4705c755245b72ed
More than 20 beaches have now been closed in the Sydney region at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak after initially staying open in the morning.
A total of 21 Sydney beaches have been closed as health officials battle to contain a growing outbreak of coronavirus on the city’s northern beaches.
The red and yellow flags were lowered on all beaches from North Palm Beach through to Manly on Friday afternoon, just hours after 10 new cases were added to the cluster that has emerged from Avalon.
Residents of the region have already been advised to stay home as much as possible for three days as NSW Health grapples with a growing COVID-19 cluster that has spread from Avalon.
Northern Beaches Council has also temporarily closed a host of community facilities including libraries, parks, swimming pools, skateparks, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and theatres.
Despite that beaches remained open on Friday morning where surfers could be seen out off Narrabeen beach with a handful of well-behaved families and exercisers walking along the sand.
But by 3pm it was announced the beaches would close, with surf clubs now shut and volunteer lifesaving patrols scheduled for the weekend cancelled.
Northern Beaches mayor Michael Regan said the community had to work together to avoid further lock downs.
“It’s tough but we are hoping this short-term pain will reward us with long term gain. Let’s stop the spread now so we get a chance to enjoy this Christmas together,” he said.
“Council will be providing lifeguards at all beaches providing surveillance.”
Surf Life Saving NSW advised that people are swimming at their own risk if no flags have been raised.
The organisation’s chief executive Steve Pearce said the decision was backing the State Government’s call for residents of the northern beaches to stay home.
“Please don’t go to the beach, both to limit the risk of spreading the virus, along with staying safe because beaches will not be patrolled, however, lifeguards are maintaining surveillance capability,” he said.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian told media on Friday the message for northern beaches residents to stay home remained only advice and that the government was not yet considering mandatory orders.
Ms Berejiklian’s stance came after 10 new cases were diagnosed overnight, all of which were linked to the Avalon cluster that now stands at 28.
NSW Health have identified 15 instances of community transmission in the last 24 hours.
“We are hopeful it won’t come to that because today the community has demonstrated enormous goodwill, they have responded to the additional testing we have asked them to do, we know from anecdotal evidence this morning that people are staying home and not coming to work and are restricting their behaviour so I want to thank the community for taking that response,” the Premier said.
“We don’t want to go down the mandatory path but we will if we have to but at this stage, let’s see how the next 24-48 hours goes and I will not hesitate to take on health advice if Dr (Kerry) Chant and her team give us advice to the alternative.
“At this stage we believe what we have in place is commensurate or matches what the risk is.”

The actor’s rant at staff had “zero” to do with COVID-19 and all to do with showing off his “tyrant” power, according to former Scientologists.
Tom Cruise’s epic rant at film staff had “zero” to do with COVID-19 and all to do with showing off his “tyrant” power, according to his former Scientology pals.
The furious star tore into workers who broke COVID rules on the set of Mission: Impossible, screaming: “If I see you doing it again, you’re f***ing gone”, The Sun reports.
Scientology’s former Commanding Officer at its Los Angeles Celebrity Center, Karen Pressley, was a high ranking member of the hardcore Sea Org for 12 years, signing a billion-year contract.
She also wrote a book about how the Church hooks in A-list celebrities, called Escaping Scientology, An Insider’s True Story.

RELATED: Crew members quit over Tom Cruise’s spray
As an expert on the church’s stars, Karen says prominent Scientologist Cruise’s rant has “zero” to do with COVID and describes it as “Scientology mindf**k”.
“TC’s [Tom Cruise’s] rant to his film crew is a classic example of the Scientology mindf**k I witnessed for 16 years working under David Miscavige and other seniors in Scientology’s food chain,” Karen told The Sun.
“There’s enough truth and logic in the content of TC’s rant that makes people stand to attention, listen and comply. Yes, TC makes a good point: they all have to be perfectly careful and not screw up in the middle of this great opportunity to work on this movie when so many in the industry are out of work because of COVID.
“And, in TC’s case, he believes himself to be a saviour to people wherever he goes, whether he’s making a movie – he has to save the day, or he drives by an accident, and is the only one who can save them because he’s a Scientologist.
“But how to convey his message is a matter of choice. He uses way too much force than is necessary, he uses beratement and threats of job loss for not complying. He verbally pummels the people instead of using compassion and intention.
“This was dramatised every day in the Sea Org, with seniors showing their total inability to contain their anger and frustration, unable to communicate effectively using reason with the right words and intention.
“Instead, throwing their emotional garbage into their delivery of the message – reduce the people, fill them with fear, make them feel they must comply or they would be punished.
“Acting like a tyrant is a choice, especially with his saviour complex, while getting people to believe he’s doing them a favour. But that’s Scientology.”
Scientology Church spokespeople have previously denied claims of beratement and emotional abuse of subordinates.
Brendan Tighe, Cruise’s former security guard in Scientology, says the way the actor was ranting was pure “Church-speak” and inspired by the star’s friend and Scientology leader, David Miscavige, who has a reputation for abusive tirades.
Brendan, a former Scientologist for 30 years, says: “I’ve only ever heard this exact way of ‘talking’ while in Scientology.
“One hundred per cent channelling David Miscavige. I would even go out on a limb and say he is not personally concerned about COVID or even financial loss but wanting to be in control – and not in a healthy way.
“This is eerily similar to the rantings of [founder L. Ron] Hubbard that the mission of Scientology is more important than the individuals in it.”
Former follower Katrina Reyes worked for celebrities such as Cruise, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, who would come to the global HQ in Clearwater, Florida for their courses.
Katrina allegedly signed a billion-year contract with the Sea Org at the age of 11, before leaving eight years later.
Since then, she’s not been able to speak to her mum Yelena, a Sea Org member, who is now the manager of the Church’s retreat hotel The Sandcastle in Clearwater, where Tom’s son Connor has reportedly been living for the last four years.
She says that not only does he sound like Miscavige, but he could have been rebuking Scientology members on-set, which could be indicated by them responding to his rant with “Sir”.
In the past, Cruise has been known to demand Scientology handlers have behind-the-camera film roles and his sister Lee Anne DeVette, also a devout follower, was his film agent.
“He totally sounds like David Miscavige when he rips staff members for small mistakes. The phase ‘gold standard’ sounds very much like Scientology language to me. The way he addressed the film crew like he was some general drilling his army was very uncalled for, but very normal in Sea Org and Scientology world,” Katrina said.
“Also, when I hear a couple of people respond to, ‘Is that understood?’ I’m pretty sure I heard a couple of people say, ‘Yes, sir’. These are probably Scientology employees that work for Tom, because in Scientology, Tom has to be called ‘Sir’ by everyone.
“I honestly can’t answer if he actually cares about COVID, I know in Scientology you care about rules, orders and structure more than anything else. So is he just on a power high or does he care about COVID?”
Cruise, 58, flew into a rage after spotting two of the film crew standing less than a metre away from each other at a computer screen.
Fifty members of staff working on set at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, Herts, were left shocked by the furious tirade.
Cruise was left frustrated that his efforts to keep filming going during the pandemic could be at risk, adding: “They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherf***ers.
“That’s it. No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their f***ing homes because our industry is shut down.”
The Sun reached out to the Church of Scientology and a representative for Tom Cruise for comment.

The list of venues with virus cases continues to grow as more confirmed infections are added to Sydney’s northern beaches cluster.
Dozens of venues are on high alert and train passengers have been urged to monitor symptoms as Sydney’s northern beaches cluster continues to grow.
There were 17 confirmed cases of the virus by midnight Thursday, with that figure expected to grow as beachside residents flock to testing sites.
The list of venues with confirmed cases is growing, with major supermarkets, banks and a chemist now among them.
Those who have visited the following locations have been urged to get tested immediately and isolate until they receive a negative result:
Woolworths Mona Vale, 25/29 Park St, Mona Vale, December 13, 12-12.30pm

Avalon Beach Post Shop, 45 Avalon Parade, Avalon Beach, December 16, 3.30-3.50pm
A confirmed case also travelled on the train network on December 14. NSW Health said passengers are considered casual contacts and should get a test and isolate until they get a negative result.
Roseville to Redfern, 6.50-7.40am
Redfern to Milsons Point, 11.20-11.45am
Milsons Point to Roseville, 3.15-3.40pm
Three RSL clubs are also on high alert including one in the city’s west.
The health department said people who visited the venues are considered close contacts and need to get a test and isolate for 14 days.
These include:
Avalon RSL Club, December 11, all day until close
Penrith RSL Club, December 13, 1-6pm
Kirribilli Club, December 14, 12-3pm
Contact tracers are racing to determine the source of the infection, with early reports suggesting one of the RSL clubs may be the key.
On Thursday NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said it was “critical” to locate everyone that visited the Avalon RSL Club on December 11.
“Our working hypothesis is that someone at that RSL club was potentially the source of infection for a number of subsequent cases,” she said.
“So, it is critical that we identify any individuals that may be positive there.”
The news comes as it was revealed one positive case played the drums in a band who performed all around Sydney, spreading possible sites of infection across the city.
Several other sites were also listed earlier on Thursday. Anyone at the venues below must get tested and isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.
Hungry Ghost Cafe, 20 Avalon Parade, Avalon – Sunday, December 13, 9.30-11am and Tuesday, December 15, 9.30-11am
Sneaky Grind Cafe, 3/48 Old Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach, December 14, 9.30-11am Barramee

Bangkok Sidewalk Restaurant, 1/21-23 Old Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach, December 14, 7-8pm
Avalon Bowlo (bowling club), 4 Bowling Green Lane Avalon Beach, December 13, 5-7pm (not 3-5pm as previously reported) and Tuesday, December 15, 3-5pm
Palm Beach female change rooms, December 13, 9-9.15am
Coast Palm Beach Cafe, Barren Joey Road, Palm Beach, December 13, 10‑11am
There are also a number of spots where visitors at certain times have been advised to get tested and then self-isolate until a negative result is received. These include:
Bing Lee, Gateway, 1 Mona Vale Road, Mona Vale, December 14, 4.30‑4.45pm
Woolworths Avalon Beach, 74 Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach, December 13, 12-5pm, and Tuesday, December 15, 12-12.30pm
Oliver’s Pie, Careel Shopping Village, 1 Careel Head Rd, Avalon Beach, December 14, 9-9.15am
New pop-up testing clinics have been made available, along with a drive-through version at Avalon Bowling Club.
Meanwhile, states have announced a series of changes to travel that could see some forced to quarantine over Christmas at their own expense.
The infections are NSW’s first cases of community transmission since December 3.
The prime minister has been accused of “going missing” on coronavirus issues including quarantine and state border closures.

The worrying cluster on Sydney’s northern beaches continues to grows, with more infections revealed on Friday.
The northern beaches cluster continues to grow, with 10 new cases revealed on Friday, taking the outbreak to 28 as stay at home orders kick in.
An additional case was also recorded in a resident who travelled to Queensland and will be reported in Queensland’s numbers.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people to stay at home and expects numbers to grow over the coming days.
“People should be not leaving their home unless absolutely necessary,” she said.
“Wear a mask, especially if going grocery shopping and stay away from non-essential activities.
Of the new cases, eight attended the Avalon RSL, 16 went to the Avalon Bowlo, two cases attended both and two have been linked back to those events.
RELATED : People ordered to stay home amid new border measures
“If we don’t get on top of it in the next few days it could mean further restrictions,” Ms Berejiklian said.
No further cases have been linked to the Sydney airport bus driver who transports flight crew and tested positive earlier in the week.
It is also likely the strain came from the US, chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed, prompting concerns about quarantine and restrictions in place for US-based airline staff.
“NSW Health can now confirm the viral genome sequencing of the Avalon COVID-19 cluster does not match the virus strains seen in recent clusters in Australia,” the health department said in the statement.
“This virus may be of United States origin and linked to international aircrew, however investigations are continuing.”
New cases include two residents from southeast Sydney who are also linked to the Avalon cluster.
RELATED : Sydney’s virus outbreak moves south.
Meanwhile residents north of Sydney’s Spit Bridge, all the way to Palm Beach, have been warned to stay home as health authorities race to determine the source of the outbreak.
People in the area have been urged against visiting friends or relatives in aged care facilities or hospitals unless it is essential.
Unnecessary gatherings should be avoided, as well as high-risk venues such as clubs and restaurants, and people should stick to their household group.
“At this time, we request that people from outside the area should avoid unnecessary travel to the Northern Beaches,” a spokesman from NSW Health said.
The request applies to everyone from Palm Beach to The Spit.
Several venues have also been put on alert and queues at testing clinics in the Northern Beaches have exploded, with queues starting hours before the centres opened on Friday.
Pop up clinics are operational until 10pm.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard urged people who live in the northern beaches of Sydney to get tested if they felt any cold or flu-like symptoms.
“Err on the side of having the test,” Mr Hazzard said.
The news comes as other state leaders have slammed their borders shut on anyone crossing the NSW border.
Northern beaches residents are banned from entering Victoria as of midnight, while Queensland has also resorted to a hot spot method.
Anyone arriving in Western Australia needs to self-isolate for 14 days.
Tasmania declared Sydney’s Northern Beaches Local Government Area high risk on Friday morning.
While anyone who travels from there to the Northern Territory will have to stay for 14 days in a supervised quarantine facility in Alice Springs or Darwin.

A jam-packed crowd at the SCG was almost inconceivable six months ago, Tuesday’s match was a welcome return.
Sydney’s cricket fans were treated to a glimpse of life before COVID-19 during the third T20 international between Australia and India on Tuesday evening.
There was no social distancing on display at the SCG – as tens of thousands of vocal spectators filled the stands, with very few gaps visible in the crowd.

Only 50 per cent capacity was permitted at Sunday’s thrilling T20, but the New South Wales Government revealed coronavirus restrictions would be eased from Monday, allowing the SCG to host events at full capacity.
“From Monday, life will be very different in New South Wales,” Gladys Berejiklian promised.
The New South Wales Premier’s remarks were validated on Tuesday, as cricket fans packed into the light rail trains at Central Station, squeezing into carriages like sardines.
The traffic heading south across Sydney Harbour was even more cataclysmic, with commuters stuck in the tunnel for up to 45 minutes.
And the jubilant Swami Army was in full voice outside Gate E, their chants and drums echoing around Moore Park.
They were scenes unlike anything we’ve come to accept amid a global pandemic, but it was a refreshing change of atmosphere after several months of self-isolation.

Although the third T20 international was slated as a dead rubber, that didn’t stop Sydney locals filling the 48,000-seat venue, with less than 500 tickets going unsold.
And as expected, the Victor Trumper Stand was a lively sea of blue, which erupted every time an Australian wicket fell.
When Aussie skipper Aaron Finch was dismissed for a duck in the second over, dozens of Indian flags magically appeared among the chaos.
It was a stark contrast to the eerie atmosphere that greeted Australia’s one-day side at the same venue in March.
The world was only just coming to terms with the pandemic when Cricket Australia decided the first ODI against New Zealand would be played without spectators.

The footage of empty stands was bitterly confronting at the time. Finch and Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson giggled politely after they almost shook hands at the coin toss, but their laughs masked feelings of uncertainty and trepidation.

Early in Australia’s innings, paceman Kane Richardson was rushed off for a COVID-19 test after experiencing flu symptoms. He had a few days earlier returned from a tour to South Africa.
Adam Zampa’s precise wrong-un to remove Williamson would have typically evoked stunned applause from spectators. But instead, he was congratulated with a splutter of polite claps from the changerooms, barely audible on Fox Cricket’s coverage.
In the end, Finch’s side secured a comfortable victory over their trans-Tasman rivals, but the match signified a turning point in Australian sport. It was the last ODI to take place before the world went into lockdown.
A few days later, the NRL and AFL postponed their respective competitions.
As global cases drastically snowballed in the autumn months, there were genuine concerns the 2020/21 summer of cricket would not go ahead.
A jam-packed crowd at the SCG was almost inconceivable six months ago, and for that reason, Tuesday’s match was a welcome return to normality.
As the Australian public awaits the coronavirus vaccine rollout, some of the country’s top cricketers may soon get the jab in India.
Nobody was quite sure what was happening when Indian cricket star Mohammed Siraj was filmed acting strangely with a teammate.

An incident at a Queensland hotel has led to almost a dozen officers being forced into isolation after potentially being exposed to COVID-19.
An incident at a Queensland quarantine hotel has led to almost a dozen officers being forced into isolation after potentially being exposed to COVID-19.
Some 11 police officers have been asked to isolate in hotels or at home after a returned traveller tried to flee their hotel, a Queensland Police spokesperson confirmed to news.com.au.
A police source told 7 News the returned traveller, 41, was suffering from psychosis when they tried to leave the Rydges Hotel Southbank. The man was stopped by police given a medical assessment.
Police later took him back to his hotel, and the man later tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday.

The officers involved have been told to self isolate. Some are quarantining in their homes and others are in the Rydges Hotel Southbank.
A Queensland Police spokesperson said the officers were wearing personal protective equipment at the time of the incident.
“The 11 officers remain in isolation and as of today, all have returned negative tests,” the spokesperson said.
“The Queensland Police Service is conducting welfare checks on the members each day and has been able to make arrangements to ensure adequate staffing is in place while they are isolating.”

Meanwhile, traces of coronavirus have been detected in wastewater in far north Queensland, despite the state celebrating more than 70 days without transmission.
Viral fragments were found in samples of wastewater collected in Cairns last Tuesday, in sewers servicing quarantine hotels and Cairns Hospital, according to reports.

A spokesperson for Queensland Health told The Cairns Post the discovery could mean there are undetected cases in the area.
“People shouldn’t be alarmed but they shouldn’t be complacent either, if you are sick with symptoms which could be due to COVID-19 go and get tested and then stay home until you get your results,” the spokesman said.
He added the detection of the virus in the wastewater did not necessarily indicate there was a positive case in the community.

It’s been more than four months since the border between NSW and Victoria was closed but tonight, that all changes.
The border between New South Wales and Victoria will reopen tonight as each state celebrates weeks without any local cases of COVID-19.
“I’m feeling very confident about today’s decision and also confident, fingers crossed, that our people will continue to do the right thing,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in the border town of Albury on Sunday.
The closure began on July 8 when Victoria’s second wave of triple-figure daily infection totals started to take hold. Only those with valid entry permits or authorisation could enter.
Sunday marked the southern state’s 23rd consecutive day of no new coronavirus cases and Saturday was the 14th straight day of zero cases in NSW.

Earlier this month, the NSW government revealed the border will reopen at 12.01am on Monday, November 23.
Ms Berejiklian said the reopening is “another step in the right direction”.
“I want to thank the community, particularly in our border towns, for their patience during what has been an extremely difficult time,” she said at the time.
“We have worked closely with the Victorian Government throughout the border closure and will continue to monitor the situation as restrictions are eased.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the date marked two weeks since Victoria dropped its “ring of steel”, allowing for travel between the state’s regions and metropolitan Melbourne.
“This will be good riddance to a border that COVID-19 forced on us,” he said.
“Victorian and NSW residents’ efforts have ensured families and friends will be back together and businesses will operate freely but in a COVID-safe way.”
NSW Health states people entering from Victoria will no longer need a border entry permit.
Murray River Police District Commander, Superintendent Paul Smith, told The Albury Wodonga News there will be works along the border from 12.01am and 6am on Monday to remove the checkpoints.
This includes the Sturt Hwy at Buronga, Cobb Highway at Moama, Wodonga Place at Albury, Hume Freeway at Albury and Princess Hwy on the South Coast.
“There will be works going on at all 27 sites and we want everyone to be safe while we get these checkpoints packed down,” he said.

Authorities have revealed the plan that will allow 50,000 rugby league fans to sit side-by-side without causing a COVID-19 outbreak.
Queensland COVID-19 restrictions will ease on Tuesday afternoon, just in time for the State of Origin decider to be played in front of the largest crowd anywhere in the world since the onset of the pandemic.
It’s been 64 days since the last case of community transmission in the Sunshine State. The virus-free run last week prompted the chief health officer to advise the Premier to peel back restrictions, including increasing stadium capacity to 100 per cent.
More than 52,000 people are therefore technically able to be seated side-by-side at the game but are being advised to wear face masks and practise social distancing where possible.
It comes as Queensland authorities race to track down more than 7000 people who have entered the state from South Australia since last Monday, as quarantine restrictions are imposed following a worrying outbreak in Adelaide.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk asked those people on Monday to isolate where they are and get tested, as Queenslanders returning home from South Australia from midnight on Monday have to enter two weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said no one who had been in Adelaide would be able to attend the match, and contact tracing would ensure – in the event of a positive case from the match – that all exposed individuals could be quarantined.
Ms D’Ath said all ticket holders from Adelaide had been contacted by Ticketek, and as of Tuesday morning, authorities were aware of five people who had been in Adelaide since last Monday who had purchased tickets.
The SA cluster blew to 20 cases on Tuesday morning, understood to have originated from a medi-hotel in the capital city.
Ms Palaszczuk said the outbreak posed a concern to Queensland after a large number of flights arrived in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Cairns from Adelaide within the last week.
“The last thing we want to see is Queenslanders having to go into any form of lockdown,” she said on Monday.
“But this cluster outbreak is of concern.”
Dr Jeannette Young said the priority was finding those people who had arrived from Adelaide and get them tested.
“We know all the people who have come into our state from Adelaide, so we’re going to be able to contact them all and make sure that they get themselves tested,” Dr Young said.
Wednesday’s Origin decider comes two weeks after the first game of the series was played in Adelaide; however, Dr Young said the period of concern dated back only to last Monday.
The game at Suncorp will be the largest sporting game anywhere in the world since the first wave of COVID-19 suspended crowded matches in March.
The full capacity of Suncorp Stadium is 52,500, and as of Monday, there were only 4000 tickets remaining. Two thousands tickets were put aside as a gift to frontline healthcare workers and emergency services personnel.
Ms D’Ath said stadiums were able to fill 100 per cent of their seats because of allocated seating, and ticket sellers keeping all contact information.
“We know where every single person is sitting … If there are any cases, we know who to directly contact,” she said.
As a buy-in, Suncorp Stadium has introduced measures to keep the match COVID-safe, including advising ticket holders to bring their own masks and wear them to and from the game, especially when entering, exiting and moving around the stadium and on public transport.
Zone allocation is designed to limit movement within the stadium and to reduce congestion. Patrons are also asked to arrive during the time frame on their ticket and only leave when their zone is called.
The stadium is asking people who feel unwell or are showing symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home. In addition, anyone who has been in a COVID-19 hot spot in the past 14 days, which now includes Adelaide, or has been in contact with someone who has been to a hot spot should stay home.
Last month, the second Bledisloe Cup game in Auckland recorded the largest crowd anywhere in the world at a sporting match since COVID-19, welcoming 46,049 spectators.
The NRL grand final in Sydney in October recorded 36,000 spectators.
Meanwhile in the United States, 31,700 fans packed a Texas stadium on November 8 to watch an NFL game.

People have flooded Adelaide Airport, desperate to get out as states shut their borders in response to the state’s COVID-19 outbreak.
Adelaide Airport was thrown into chaos on Monday, with large crowds of passengers scrambling to either leave or return to SA after a number of jurisdictions closed their borders to the state.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the airport had little foot traffic for months.
But the flood of people came after SA recorded 17 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, all linked to the Parafield cluster.
Hundreds of people were seen there on Monday, with a number wearing masks.
WA residents Trish and Peter Skinner told NCA NewsWire they had travelled to SA last Tuesday for a friend’s wedding but decided to leave the state — before the November 21 celebration they travelled for — as soon as they heard about the outbreak.
Mrs Skinner, 52, from Karratha, said it was a “scary” experience and she wouldn’t travel “for a long time”.
“We were supposed to be here three weeks but (WA Premier) Mark (McGowan) closed the border so we want to go home,” Mrs Skinner said.
“I just read an update from him that said ‘Anyone from Adelaide should reconsider their travel to Perth’ but that’s home so we can’t stay here. We have jobs, animals, a house to get back to.”
Deborah Lennox, also from Western Australia, booked flights from Perth to Sydney that transited through Adelaide.
She was unaware of the changes to border restrictions and said she was concerned about her return flight next Monday.
“My daughter just had a child and I haven’t been able to leave Perth to see her and meet my grandson. I’m very excited to meet him,” Ms Lennox.
“Now she’s really struggling so I’ve taken a week off to see her and help her get into a routine and this flight gets me there quicker and I also have a friend who lives here that I haven’t seen for 15 years so I was hoping to catch up with them.
“(My daughter) has been alone for all of her pregnancy during COVID and Mark McGowan has been really strict.”
The cluster has triggered panic interstate, with the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Tasmania following WA’s footsteps and closing their borders to the state.
However, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced her state would keep its borders open with SA but said authorities would watch the situation closely.
“The situation in South Australia is very concerning,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“Our position in New South Wales is: we need to live with COVID and every time there’s an outbreak, you can’t shut down borders, disrupt lives, disrupt businesses.”
While Victoria labelled SA a hot spot, it also kept its borders open.

While Victorians are finally able to leave their homes, there’s still a long road ahead before they’ll be able to take a holiday.
Victorian holidaymakers are furious after it was announced camping at a popular Victorian coastal strip would remain banned until February.
Mornington Peninsula Shire Council revealed on Thursday it had postponed camping on its foreshore, saying this was the most prudent approach given COVID-19 restrictions remain in place.
“One of our major concerns is the transmission risk from people having to use the shared toilet and shower amenity blocks,” shire CEO John Baker said.
“This approach is consistent with the Chief Health Officer’s advice, which has underpinned our decision”.
Every summer, large visitor numbers flock to the peninsula to camp along the natural foreshore reserves in Rosebud, Rye and Sorrento.
But the decision to postpone the camping season has drawn fury from some who took to the council’s Facebook page to complain.
“Very poor decision by council to ban camping over Xmas. Please consider and reverse that decision!” Andrew Tucker wrote on the council’s Facebook page.
“The Department of Health and Human Services has not banned camping, why should you? What do you know that they don‘t?” said Derek Jones.
“Step up cleaning, maybe reduce capacity, but to ban it and further economically strangle our recovery without good cause defies logic.”
Others also feared it would affect the economic recovery of local shops and businesses hit hard during COVID-19.
Some, though, were unphased: “There are plenty of nicer, less crowded places than the pretentious Mornington Peninsula to spend your holiday dollars,” tweeted Bronnie.
Shire CEO Mr Baker said while it is disappointing to postpone camping, the decision was taken carefully to keep visitors and the local community safe.
Mr Baker said even as the shire is expected to move from stage three restrictions into the final stage of the roadmap, social distancing, density quotients, group sizes and a range of other measures will still be required.
“It’s not feasible to have foreshore camping under many of these conditions,” he said.
The shire will provide an update on the reopening of foreshore camping in January.
Under current rules, camping grounds and caravan parks are not open in metropolitan Melbourne but camping is allowed in regional Victoria, although there will be lower capacity to allow for social distancing.
Parks Victoria advises campers to check individual park pages before travelling, given a number of restrictions and closures are in place.
Campers must wear a mask whenever leaving their tent or caravan unless eating, drinking or doing strenuous exercise.
You can camp with the people you live with, your intimate partner, and up to two other people and their children if they cannot be left alone.
You also can only camp with people who also live in regional Victoria

On the back of big changes to work culture caused by COVID-19, a new study shows just how beneficial working from home has been.
Working from home just two days per week can save a person $860 a year in travel costs, a new report suggests.
As COVID-19 forced the nation into lockdown, it led to changes in how we worked and where.
A new study by the NSW Innovation and Productivity Council (IPC) found time and cost savings, greater productivity and increased flexibility were some of the benefits of remote working.
It saved an average of one hour and 17 minutes each day in travel time as well as a reported 13 per cent increase in productivity.
However, the study, which surveyed 1500 remote workers, found collaboration and social isolation were key challenges in working from home.
As restrictions continue to ease, the report suggested remote workers want a hybrid model in future – where they can work two to three days from home – to combine the best aspects of on-site and remote working.
Jobs and Investment Minister Stuart Ayres said while the NSW Government encouraged employees to spend more time in the office, it expected long-term changes to how the working week took shape.
“This has been an incredibly tough time with huge upheaval and change for the NSW workforce,” he said.
“The IPC’s report looks into what we learned from the experience and how it could affect the future of work.”
IPC Member Steve Sammartino said the report showed the pandemic sparked a cultural shift, with more employees and businesses wanting to continue working remotely.
“The biggest benefit is the time we save from commuting, which on average is more than an hour a day. Reducing traffic congestion makes life better for everyone, even people who don’t work remotely,” Mr Sammartino said.
“But COVID-19 pushed remote working to an unhealthy extreme, with a lot of work unable to be done remotely. It can get lonely, and collaboration is difficult.”
“In the future, NSW workers want the best of both worlds – a hybrid of remote and on-site work. Cities and offices will be buzzing again, and central business districts will be crucial for collaboration, innovation and consumption.”

Two of the three women at the centre of one of Queensland’s COVID-19 clusters have had their matters heard in court.
The young women accused of being at the centre of a Queensland COVID-19 cluster have had their matters heard in court.
Diana Lasu, 21, Olivia Muranga, 20, and Haja Timbo, 21, face up to five years’ jail and a $13,000 fine after they allegedly deceived authorities about where they had been when they returned to the Sunshine State in July.
Ms Lasu and Ms Muranga’s matters were briefly heard in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday, one month after their first appearance.
The pair, who were not required to attend, are facing charges of fraud and providing false or misleading documents.
Ms Lasu and Ms Muranga contracted COVID-19 while in declared hot spot Melbourne in July.
They infected at least three other people and sparked numerous contact tracing alerts.
Ms Timbo did not contract the virus.
At the time, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was “furious” after it was revealed the women flew from Melbourne to Sydney before landing back in Queensland on July 21, allegedly lying on their border pass about being in the southern hot spot.
At the time, Queensland’s borders were closed only to Victoria.
The fraud charge relates to the allegation they dishonestly “gained a benefit of avoiding the mandatory 14-day self quarantine period”.
Ms Lasu and Ms Muranga spent days in the community while infectious, shutting down schools and shopping centres.
One of the women worked at Parklands Christian College as a cleaner for three days while infectious, prompting it to close while all students and staff underwent mass testing.
One of the women’s sisters became infected, resulting in the after-hours school care facility she worked at to close.
Two diners at a restaurant at Sunnybank, who ate at the same time as one of the women, also contracted the virus.
Thousands of Queenslanders came forward to get tested in the aftermath.

AT THE time of writing the spring weather in southwest Victoria is being controlled by a local dairy farmer. He or she has provided generous amounts of sunshine, warmth and rain and I have spent a good part of early spring watching the wheat planted for the ducks grow before my eyes.
While there was a day in late September when Jodi, the good wife, and I had to clean up a flooded duck pen after the person in charge dialled up 40mm of rain in one night, I like to believe they thought they were doing the right thing by their cows (next time, whoever you are, spread the 40mm over two nights at least).
Cleaning up from a flood and watching wheat grow proved a useful distraction to what was happening in the real world. The hospitality industry has been cruelled by the pandemic and we are linked to it given our core business is, was, might yet be, selling paddock-reared ducks direct to chefs who care about where their food comes from.
When the pandemic first hit and restaurants closed, our order book was emptied overnight. Our goal then was simple: to keep Great Ocean Ducks in business. We made paddock-loads of changes and had a few fortunate lifelines – selling to chefs making take-home duck dinners and freighting a regular supply of ducks into South Australia have been serious wins. But by early spring it was back to putting cryovac ducks in the freezer.
The good wife and I had done this before during the first shutdown. The first time we packed hope as well as ducks into those boxes. This time we packed anticipation with the birds.
There has to come a time when the world might move a little closer to normal and we want to be ready to sell when it does.
Fortunately we’re not spending too much time in the freezer. We’ve also been selling charcuterie packs during the last week of each month. Rob Kabboord is a talented and respected chef who has lived in Melbourne and Sydney but has recently seen the light, bought some land and relocated to Wheatsheaf, near Daylesford.
He still runs his Melbourne restaurant and there he has cured duck-breast ham, crafted rillettes, a smoked duck sausage and other treats for our packs. Jodi sells them via Instagram and our recently upgraded website. Unfortunately, she sells mainly into Melbourne as solving the logistics puzzle for selling elsewhere is almost as difficult as raising children.
And that is a realm in which Jodi and I have failed, as our two girls, Madi, 17, and Milla, 16, have become criminals. They haven’t been officially convicted, but the judge (me) is investigating. Desperate to upgrade their mobile phones, the teenagers were told they needed to earn their own dosh to do so and during the pandemic began working on the farm before and after school.
Recently they acquired their phones but forensic accounting has uncovered they have charged their parents an hourly rate so extreme it could match what the Tigers are paying Dusty.
I sincerely hope the matter is speedily resolved for other pressing challenges loom. For the last few years Jodi and I and the two criminals have hosted our extended families, including my 80-something dad, John, and Jodi’s parents, for Christmas. We’d very much like to be able to do it again. Is it a luxury to be able to think this way, to not be consumed by the grind and plan for better times? I hope not.
I don’t have much time to dwell on the answer as Christmas is approaching with speed. All of us have done some hard yards to get to some sense of COVID-normal and let’s hope it continues so we can do what is most important: enjoy a festive season with our families.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/travel/travel-news/australias-travel-bubble-with-nz-opens-how-border-rules-will-change/news-story/ef5d68d79ec3871a3a86dcbbe3d19974
Australia’s borders have been locked tight for more than six months but tomorrow, three incoming passenger jets will change everything.
More than six months after Australia dramatically locked down its borders in response to COVID-19, the arrival of an Air New Zealand flight at lunch time tomorrow will signal a bold new phase of the pandemic.
Australia’s border rules will be relaxed tomorrow as the country establishes a trans-Tasman travel bubble with New Zealand.
Under the deal, New Zealanders will be allowed to travel quarantine-free into NSW and the Northern Territory if they have not been in a COVID-19 hot spot in the previous 14 days.
It will be a one-way deal initially, with New Zealand yet to say when Australians will be able to make their own journey across the ditch.
More than 350 passengers from New Zealand will arrive in Sydney on three flights on Friday after the travel bubble opens at midnight.
The first flight, Air New Zealand flight NZ103, is expected to touch down at Sydney Airport about 12.20pm with 200 passengers on board.
It will be followed by Jetstar flight JQ204 at 1.40pm and Qantas flight QF146 at 5.55pm.

While international flights continued to arrive in Australia throughout the pandemic, passengers on these flights will be the first in months to leave the airport freely, rather than being whisked away for mandatory hotel quarantine.
Kiwi holiday-makers, those reuniting with friends and relatives, and New Zealanders who are usually based in Australia are expected to be among those on board tomorrow’s flights.
Sydney Airport chief executive Geoff Culbert said the arrival of the flights would be a welcome change.
“We haven’t welcomed people to Sydney in months that haven’t had to come through customs and go straight on to buses to hotel (quarantine),” Sydney Airport chief executive Geoff Cuthbert told yesterday’s AFR National Infrastructure Summit in Sydney.
New Zealand passengers who touch down in Australia will be kept separate from returning travellers from other countries, who still need to complete hotel quarantine on arrival.
But visitors from New Zealand will still have to complete 14 days of quarantine when they return home, at a personal cost of around $NZ3100 ($A2900) per person, which has reportedly dulled interest in travelling across the ditch.
Air New Zealand told Stuff.co.nz it had seen a “small” increase in bookings to Sydney since the travel bubble was announced on October 2.
While NSW and the Northern Territory are currently the only options for travellers from New Zealand, South Australia may be the next to join the bubble, having recently relaxed its state border, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said this month.
New Zealanders hoping to take advantage of the travel bubble – which is formally called the “safe travel zone” – will be eligible if they have been in New Zealand for the last 14 days and not in a designated hot spot, and if they are travelling on a quarantine-free flight as determined by the airline.
There are no areas in New Zealand that are currently designated as hot spots by the Australian Government.
Travellers who tick all those necessarily boxes won’t have to apply for an Australian Government border exemption, but they will have to hand in a COVID-19 declaration form from the Department of Home Affairs before they board their flight.
The bubble does not apply to New Zealand citizens who are outside New Zealand.

Sydney residents are urged to get tested if they visited major stores, including a McDonald’s, Bunnings, and Woolworths after a positive case.
A person with COVID-19 visited popular locations in NSW, including a Woolworths, McDonalds, Bunnings, and Ikea.
NSW Health issued a public health alert on Tuesday afternoon urging anyone who has visited the key sites to get tested for coronavirus.
The shops and restaurants are in southwest Sydney, and a pop-up clinic has been rolled out at Oran Park to help people get tested.
Anyone who attended the following venues is considered a casual contact and must monitor for symptoms and get tested immediately if they develop, NSW Health said.
After testing, they must remain in isolation until a negative test result is received.
The venues of concern are:
Testing numbers have dropped recently, which NSW Health said was a “concern”.
“NSW Health is appealing to the community to come forward for testing right away if you have even the mildest of symptoms like a runny nose or scratchy throat, cough, fever or other symptoms that could be COVID-19,” a spokesperson said.
The new pop-up clinic to get tested is at Julia Reserve Community Centre walk-in, Peter Brock Drive, Oran Park.
It will be open from 1pm on Tuesday and will remain open daily, from 8am to 6pm, until Sunday, October 13.
The locations of all COVID-19 testing clinics can be found here or call your GP.

Prominent WA politician Mathias Cormann says the state has an “inflated sense of security” around COVID. But the Premier has rejected that idea.
Federal Finance Minister Mathias Cormann claims Western Australia has a “somewhat inflated sense of security” with its border closure and is unprepared for a COVID-19 outbreak, but the Premier says it is better to not have the virus at all.
Life in WA is essentially back to normal, but the state government has been criticised by the commonwealth and other state leaders for not reopening the border to low-risk jurisdictions, even being accused of economic protectionism.
“(WA has) this, I don’t want to call it false sense of security, but perhaps somewhat inflated sense of security from the border,” Senator Cormann told a business event on Monday.
“I don’t think we are prepared as we could be or as we should be to deal with (an outbreak).
“We haven’t really set up the systems and processes to minimise the risk and to respond to it as swiftly as we can on the basis that we believe that our border is going to keep us secure. Well, it might, it might not.”
Health Minister Roger Cook said the WA senator was wrong about the state’s preparedness, while Premier Mark McGowan said it was far better to not have the virus at all than to live with some degree of it.
“We do have all of the measures ready that if the virus comes back in we can engage in contact tracing, we can quarantine people, we have staff on standby ready to perform all those roles,” he told reporters.
“The idea that somehow it’s better to have the virus and then contact trace and clamp down and close parts of economy, close parts of the society versus not having the virus … clearly not having the virus is better.
“I know there’s lots of complaint by the commonwealth government, and particularly people from the east about these matters, but if you went to Sydney or Melbourne today there’s all sorts of rules in place about how you can gather.
“In WA we don’t have those rules in place because we’ve successfully kept the virus out.”

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/food/sydney-pub-owner-wants-customers-to-be-more-mindful-of-new-covid-rules/news-story/83380bcbfbfcbac4c09eaa4aa832f663
Some of Sydney’s most iconic nightlife venues have teamed up to beg punters to abide basic COVID restrictions as they battle to stay open.
At the end of every night, pub owner Ben Johnson breathes a “big sigh of relief”.
Another 24 hours with no COVID contact notices, no police whacking his business with a fine of up to $50,000 over misbehaving customers – he lives to trade another day.
But the Lord Gladstone hotelier says it’s getting “a little bit frustrating” that customers are still not fully compliant with the new rules, which have been in place for months.
“I am always afraid I’m gonna walk in one day and get a phone call or an email saying there was a casual (COVID) contact at the pub or that someone’s gonna walk in and say you’re not complying and fine us,” he told NCA NewsWire.
“It would put a big dent into all the work we’ve put in over the last few months, all the extra hours we’ve worked to save money.
“It would be devastating to have a chunk of the money we busted our arse for (taken as a fine) because punters weren’t taking it seriously.”
The Lord Gladstone is one of dozens of venues in Sydney that have teamed up with the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) for a new campaign aimed at complacent customers.
The ‘check check check’ campaign reminds pubgoers to check in with their correct details at the door, check their hands by regularly washing or sanitising and to check their physical distancing while they spend time out of the house.
“In the same way venues are prepping for customers before they arrive, punters need to establish new rituals when they get to their favourite local,” NTIA chair Michael Rodriguez said.
“Similar to Slip, Slop, Slap, when leaving the house it’s ‘wallet, phone and keys’ and then at a venue it’s check in, check your hands and check yourself.”
Mr Johnson says for him, there hasn’t been much of an issue until late of an evening, when the Lord Gladstone would typically move the traditional pub set-up out of the way and set up a dancefloor.
“After 10pm, when people would be used to gearing up for a big night … you see people getting a bit antsy,” he said.
“It is frustrating, but in the scheme of everything we’re dealing with, it’s not the end of the world.”
The publican said he just wants to see punters come in with “open eyes and open ears”, noting all the information they need to be across can be taken in through various, clearly placed signs before they take their first sip of beer.
“All the info is usually at the front door or the bar,” he said.
“There’s no secret conditions or points of information … there’s no secret folder you need to find to be able to drink in the pub properly.
“Keep your eyes, ears open and look for the QR code.”
The pub, unable to allow dancing or any sort of crowding under the current COVID restrictions, is still only trading at 35 to 40 per cent.
Mr Johnson said while he was enjoying the new challenge, he’d be happy to broker a deal with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.
“If Gladys and the NSW government ease the restrictions in the next two weeks, I’ll change the name of the pub from the Lord Gladstone to the Lady Gladys,” he said.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/qld-police-strategy-to-deal-with-pandemic-floods-and-bushfires-all-at-once/news-story/50cbe638fa4092f72fd0759bfe7765b4
Queensland police are bracing to respond to concurrent events with the COVID-19 pandemic and a La Nina this summer.
Queensland police are preparing for a summer season like no other, as they race to devise a strategy to concurrently deal with the coronavirus crisis and a La Nina.
Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski told ABC radio on Friday morning the force’s 12,000 sworn officers were preparing for the likely situation of a bushfire, flood, or other major weather event at the same time police manage the state’s coronavirus response, including manning the domestic border.
It comes as a La Nina event was declared for the Australian summer, the first since 2010. As a result, there’s likely to be above average rain for northern and eastern Australia, with up to 15 cyclones possible.
Until this week, police at the Queensland/NSW border had been supplemented by Australian Defence Force troops, with police now needing to adjust to fill the gap.
“We wish they (the ADF) could have stayed, they did a fantastic job,” Mr Gollschewski told ABC radio.
“But we’ve got a rather interesting looking wet season to prepare for.”
On “day 248” of Queensland’s public health emergency, State Disaster Coordinator Mr Gollschewski is now planning for the likely situation of “concurrent events” this summer.
“We anticipate some sort of weather event – whether that’s a bushfire or heavy rain or flood – at the same time as (we are dealing with) COVID-19,” he said.
“We’re preparing strongly for that, but we’re confident we have that under control.”
At least 1000 police officers around the state are involved in the COVID-19 response, 12 per cent of the force’s 12,000 sworn officers. On Thursday, at least 95 were stationed at the border.
ADF support continues to be provided at other major coronavirus management points such as hotel quarantine and international arrivals, assistance Mr Gollschewski welcomes as Queensland’s arrivals cap increases.
“The flight cap has this week increased to 700 people per week, and up to 1000 in the coming weeks. It’s great to have more people coming home,” he said.
“We’re grateful for ADF assistance.”
Queensland’s border has relaxed slightly to allow free travel between the Sunshine State and more regions of northern NSW, giving an extra 152,000 people access to the northern state.
In the first 24 hours, police checked 4644 cars and turned around 71. Police are urging motorists to plan ahead for the long weekend, with lengthy delays expected for Monday’s public holiday in Queensland and NSW.
“Please be patient,” Mr Gollschewski said.

Staff transport difficulties because of COVID-19 are the main reason Tofane will have her last run before The Everest in Saturday’s Group 2 Gilgai Stakes in Melbourne.
The search for the perfect preparation led to Melbourne mare Tofane having her final lead-up run before The Everest in Saturday’s Group 2 Gilgai Stakes at Flemington.
Yulong Investments secured Tofane as its representative in The Everest after the five-year-old’s solid first-up third in the Group 2 Bobbie Lewis Quality (1200m) at Flemington on September 12.
Since securing a slot in the $15 million event, trainer Mike Moroney’s focus has been on getting Tofane to Sydney with the same staff member that looked after the mare in the autumn.
Tofane thrived during the Sydney autumn carnival, running third in the Group 1 Galaxy before scoring her maiden Group 1 win in the All Aged Stakes (1400m) in April.
But Melbourne’s COVID-19 crisis and resulting travel restrictions into New South Wales have made the logistics difficult for the trainer, meaning Tofane needed to have her lead-up to The Everest in Melbourne.
“There was the Premiere (Stakes in Sydney) but we’re having a lot of trouble getting a staff member up there,” Moroney said.
“We’ve worked away with NSW on it for the last 10 days but it looks like we’re going to have to send her up with someone else for a while to look after her.
“For that reason, we kept her down here as long as we can.”
Moroney said Tofane’s immense breeding value also meant he had to be careful with her transport. He said he eventually found a solution but not his first-choice arrangement.
“You have got to remember she’s worth a lot of money now and I’ve got an obligation to the owners to make sure she’s looked after well because of her value,” Moroney said.
“I didn’t want to send her up there early because it would mean she’d be up there a while (before The Everest). I wanted to send the girl up that looked after her last time when I couldn’t go.
“We’ve got someone up there, the girl that ran my stable up in Sydney will look after her.
“She knows her ways so it’s not as bad but I would still have liked to send the girl that looks after her down here.”
Damien Oliver will ride Tofane in the Gilgai Stakes before Tommy Berry takes over aboard the daughter of Ocean Park in The Everest.

An overwhelming majority of new cases recorded in Victoria still remain under investigation, with authorities desperately trying to link the cases to known outbreaks. It comes as Brett Sutton hit back at claims Victoria is pursing an eradication strategy for COVID-19 after a series of comments by former Health Minister Jenny Mikakos.

Victoria has recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus, along with four deaths.
The state’s death toll is now 798.
The consistently low infection numbers mean Melbourne‘s crucial 14-day average remains firmly below 20, standing at 16.4.
Regional Victoria’s rolling average is 0.3.
There are 21 cases of an unknown source in metropolitan Melbourne and none across regional Victoria, with nine of today’s cases will under investigation.
Two of today’s are linked to aged care (Estia Keilor and Edenvale Manor) and two are linked to the Butcher Club at Chadstone. The other nine cases remain under investigation.
Currently, there are 326 active cases of COVID-19 across the state, including 147 in aged-care and one in disability care, and 46 among healthcare workers.
Regional Victoria is home to three cases, with no new cases recorded today.
The latest fatalities include a woman in her 70s, a woman in her 80s, and a woman in her 90s. Two of today’s four deaths are linked to a known aged care facility outbreak.
Forty-four Victorians in hospital, including six in intensive care all of which are on ventilators.
A total of 2,694,959 test results have been received which is an increase of 17,937 since yesterday.
It comes after 10 new cases and seven deaths were recorded on Tuesday.
All of Tuesday unknown new cases have been closed off and linked to existing outbreaks.
If cases remain low, Melbourne is expected to take the third step on the state’s COVID-19 recovery road map on October 19, a week earlier than originally scheduled.
Premier Daniel Andrews is set to provide an update at 11am.
CHADSTONE ADDED TO CITY’S HIGH RISK VIRUS LOCATIONS
A number of popular stores at Chadstone Shopping Centre have been added to the growing list of high-risk coronavirus hot spots around Melbourne.
“The locations listed are where there is a higher risk you may have been exposed to coronavirus (COVID-19),” the Department of Health and Human Services website says.
“The information is based on advice provided to the department by people who are confirmed cases.
“Risk locations will remain on the list for 14 days from the most recent exposure.
“The locations on this list are not a current risk to the public and you can visit them in line with current restrictions.”
Authorities say anyone who visited the locations during the dates should watch for symptoms and immediately get tested if symptoms do occur.
The new risk locations include:
— Woolworths Ashwood on 26 Sept,
— Coles Chadstone on 27 Sept,
— Chadstone Shopping Centre Fresh Food Precinct on 23-26 Sept between 6am-6pm,
— The Butcher Club – Chadstone Shopping Centre on 23-26 Sept between 6am-6pm.

VIC NOT PURSUING ERADICATION STRATEGY: CHO
Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton on Wednesday reaffirmed that Victoria’s coronavirus strategy was to suppress the virus.
It comes after two public comments by former Health Minister Jenny Mikakos in which she referred to the state as being on track for eradication.
Prof Sutton said the focus remained on tackling community transmission and would not be drawn on Ms Mikakos statements.
“I’m not commenting on an ex-Mp commenting on Twitter,” he said.
“There’s nothing new in this space, the aggressive suppression strategy is a national cabinet strategy.
“We are looking to get to zero community transmission
“But it is in recognition of the fact the virus is out there globally, the virus will always have an opportunity to re-emerge in any jurisdiction no matter how long they might have gone without any community transmission.
“That’s been the case in Auckland, New Zealand and that’s been the case in other jurisdictions in Australia.”
Prof Sutton said Ms Mikakos was “extraordinarily hard working” and her replacement Martin Foley was up to the role.
“Having met, spoken to and gone through the strategy with Minister Foley, we are on the same page,” he said.
“He’s not been disconnected from the department of health’s work in general with his previous portfolio (mental health) obviously sitting in the building.
“It is the work of the department that he will oversee that everyone is totally focused on that task and knows their job.”
ACTIVE OUTBREAKS IN VICTORIA
Active aged care outbreaks with the highest active case numbers are
Estia Aged Care Facility Keilor: 33 (46 total)
Opal Hobsons Bay Aged Care Facility Altona North: 21 (total cases: 45)

— 5 linked to the Springvale shared accommodation outbreak (total cases: 5)
— 4 linked to Alfred Hospital (total cases: 11)
— 3 linked to Footscray Hospital (total cases: 20)
ANGLESEA RESIDENTS URGED TO GET TESTED
Sewerage testing on Tuesday picked up traces of coronavirus at Anglesea.
The result may not mean there are active cases in the region but a testing blitz will be launched in the area as a precaution.
An active testing centre has been set up at Anglesea town hall, testing commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed.
“Anybody in the area who has any symptoms whatsoever ... please come forward to get tested. We know either there is somebody who had COVID-19 who is in the area or someone who passed through, but someone could have coronavirus and not be aware of it,” Mr Weimar said.
BIRTHDAY PARTY GUESTS HID IN GARDEN
Twelve people have been fined after police pounced on a Melbourne birthday party and found guests hiding in the garden.
They were among 101 fined for COVID-19 breaches across Victoria over the past 24 hours.
Police caught the partygoers hiding in the garden at a private property in Coburg. The residents confirmed the gathering was to celebrate a birthday and 12 fines were issued.
Seven people from different households were also caught gathering at a Sunshine West address.
Sixteen others were fined for failing to wear a mask and 23 people were fined at vehicle checkpoints.
More than 28,000 vehicles were checked and 912 spot checks were done on people at homes, businesses and public places across the state.
It brings to 470,359 the number of spot checks conducted since March 21.
TESTING STEPS IN HIGH RISK INDUSTRIES
High-risk industries will be asked to test a quarter of their workforce each week under a new plan to tackle future coronavirus outbreaks.
Medium and large employers in the meat, poultry, seafood processing will be asked to test a quarter of their staff each week, with the goal of having most of the work force tested every month.
This will include supermarket and refrigerated distribution sectors.
Employees will not be required to self-isolate after every test and will be encouraged to use one of the government’s 200 testing sites from Thursday even if they are not symptomatic.
The Commonwealth will also test all private age care staff through a private tester.
Metropolitan aged care staff will also be tested every fortnight.
“Those businesses know it’s in their interest and everyone’s interest across the state to have that sense of monitoring,” Daniel Andrews said.
“This thing can simmer, it can be out there and not necessarily be obvious to you.”
ANDREWS STANDS BY EMBATTLED SENIOR BUREAUCRATS
Premier Daniel Andrews is standing by three senior bureaucrats savaged by lawyers assisting the inquiry into the botched program.
Counsel assisting the inquiry said on Monday that three departmental secretaries – Premier and Cabinet’s Chris Eccles, Health and Human Services’ Kym Peake, and Jobs, Precincts and Regions’ Simon Phemister — had failed to properly brief their ministers.
But Mr Andrews has backed the trio, saying he was satisfied they should remain in their roles leading the public service out of the pandemic.
“I’m confident that those three public servants are acting appropriately,” he said.
Mr Andrews said that he would move quickly to act on any recommendations the inquiry made in its report, due on November 6.
But he said flights — diverted from Melbourne — would not resume until after the inquiry hands down its report.
“There’s quite a lot of work going on so that we can be ready on that issue, to set something up that is as safe as possible,” Mr Andrews said.
“It will be one of those things where we want to leave room to be able to add to that framework in the event that the board puts to thus is certain things we should do.”
Self-Employed Australia wrote to WorkSafe on Tuesday “seeking prosecution of the Victorian government for breaches of work safety laws”.
The group urged the watchdog to prosecute the Premier, three ministers, 16 senior bureaucrats and five government departments over “indictable criminal offences against the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004”.
“The public evidence given under oath to the Inquiry describes a work system of hotel
quarantine that was chaotic, disorganised, uncoordinated, badly resourced and without
control systems capable of achieving the primary objective — namely, to contain and stop
the spread of COVID-19 by returning travellers,” the group said.
The Department of Justice and Community Safety confirmed on Tuesday that nine people who worked at the “health hotels” had tested positive for COVID-19 since July 27 — but said it was not believed they were infected while working at the hotels.
It comes as concerns are raised that the entire scheme may have been unlawful, and the nation’s medical expert panel considers a bold plan that would triage overseas arrivals and allow, at least some, to quarantine at home.
Scott Morrison said it had been the states and territories that were “the most urgent in moving forward” with the hotel model.
But the Prime Minister said the medical expert panel was now considering “alternative methods” for quarantining those returning from overseas.
“As time goes on, we will need a more flexible approach that gives us more options for managing this,” he said.
Concerns about the lawfulness of the scheme have been raised over the failure of authorities to regularly review the holding of a person in detention.
The Department of Health and Human Services was advised it must conduct reviews every 24 hours of persons detained in the hotel quarantine program – but failed to do so.
The government could now face potential legal action over the failure.
Human Rights Law Centre executive director Hugh de Kretser, who was detained in the hotel quarantine program, said there were serious questions about whether authorities acted unlawfully.
“The government has been given extreme powers to respond to this pandemic and its critical they are used responsibly,” he said.
RESTRICTIONS WE COULD BE FORCED TO LIVE WITH
Watching footy at the MCG and dining in Melbourne restaurants could be changed for a decade by COVID-19.
Expect to see more than 15 per cent of the crowd at next year’s Grand Final wearing masks; a prospect Victorians could not have dreamt of just six months ago.
And prepare to dine differently in Melbourne’s popular cafes and restaurants than you did pre-pandemic.
Leading demographer Bernard Salt said masks were set to become a feature of Victorian – and particularly Melbourne – life, for perhaps the next ten years.

HAVE YOUR SAY ON HOW VICTORIA SHOULD REBUILD
TEACHERS FIRE BACK AT TREASURER’S SCHOOL CLAIMS
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has called for all Victorian students to return to school “now”, but principals groups have urged him to “stick to his knitting”.
The Victorian MP urged Premier Daniel Andrews to allow all year levels to get back to the classroom, citing concerns over declining mental wellbeing.
Mr Frydenberg said as a Victorian parent he was “very focused on my children and other people’s children getting back to school”.
“I note that the timetable has been accelerated for some of the year levels but I cannot see why all students can’t get back to school in Victoria now,” he said on Tuesday.
But Australian Principals Federation president Julie Podbury said Mr Frydenberg should concentrate on the economy and “let us deal with education”.
“My principals are very happy with the timeline,” she said.
“It’s not just the wellbeing of the kids — it’s the wellbeing of teachers, principals and support staff and they’re worried about (virus) numbers.”
It comes after the return of primary kids in grades 3 to 6 was brought forward by two weeks, to October 12, while those in years 7 to 10 continue to wait until at least October 26.
Mr Frydenberg said he’d read letters from doctors and GPs that spoke to a declining mental health of Victorian children due to the lockdown.
Among them was a letter from Melbourne GP Dr Stacey Harris, who urged Mr Andrews to return children in term 4, saying she had to put young patients on anti depressants, who “cry how much they are missing school and friends”.
“And the number of cases that they are seeing through their doors (are) skyrocketing, providing antidepressants to kids as young as 12 and 13 as a result of this lockdown,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“So I say to the Premier, follow the medical advice, but please get Victorian children back to school at all levels.”
Victorian Association of State Secondary Principals president Sue Bell said Mr Frydenberg should leave the decisions to the health and education experts.
“We feel his pain and frustration as a parent, but as a leader in our country, we expect him to look at the bigger picture,” she said.
Ms Podbury said principals noted the return timeline was “playing very cautiously” so to not disrupt the compulsory General Achievement Test for VCE students on October 7.
“I’m fairly confident that most of the kids will be back fairly quickly after that,” she said.
Education Minister James Merlino said “all decisions about the return of 7-10 students to face-to-face learning will be based upon expert public health advice”.
Meanwhile, about 100 Victorian boarder students who live in remote NSW are being forced to fly to Sydney if they want to go home in a “bizarre” state health order.
Caroline Booth, from southern NSW, is calling for changes to arrangements that force her three kids boarding at Ballarat Grammar to travel to Melbourne and fly to Sydney if they need to return home, increasing their COVID-19 exposure risk.
“Boarding school is difficult at the best of times, but if the kids get sick for example I’ll have no choice but to bring them back through Sydney even though our place is only five hours from Ballarat,” she said.

APP NOT USED FOR CONTRACT TRACING
For a fortnight at the height of the second wave, the Victorian Government stopped using the COVIDSafe app to track down coronavirus cases.
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was concerned about the privacy of user data, according to the federal Department of Health.
“DHHS were also concerned about whether the privacy laws prohibited access to COVIDSafe App data by contact tracers from interstate and third party providers who were assisting Victoria in their contact tracing efforts,” the federal Department of Health said in an answer to a question on notice.
“As a result, contact tracing interviews did not collect information or access details of cases who had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, while the legal position was clarified.”
The DHHS halted using the app on July 16 and did not restart until August 1.
Victorian Senator James Patterson said it was a shame the state had scrapped the use that has proved useful in tracking down cases in NSW.
“It’s disappointing that at the height of the crisis the Victorian government wasn’t using every tool available at its disposal to quickly track and trace the virus,” Senator Patterson told the Herald Sun.
“We will never know how many were missed in Victoria by their failure to do so.”
A DHHS spokesman said the app would play an “important role in the response to the pandemic going forward”.
To date, 1837 Victorian cases have used the app.
Daniel Andrews has been under sustained pressure to improve the state’s troubled contact tracing system, with Victorian officials sent to NSW to learn from their counterparts north of the border.

Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has scathingly critiqued the Federal Government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Anthony Albanese is set to unleash a scathing critique of the Federal Government’s leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying support measures created debt that would take generations to repay.
The leader of the Labor Party, who will deliver a speech to the McKell Institute in Sydney on Wednesday, said the Coalition needed to explain how a $1 trillion debt was manageable.
“Australia is in a deep and painful recession. The Morrison recession,” Mr Albanese said.
“Nearly a million Australians are unemployed and 400,000 more will join them by Christmas.
“Let’s not forget before anyone had even heard of coronavirus, the Coalition had already doubled debt.
“Economic growth was already below trend, wages were stagnant, productivity was already going backwards, business investment was already in decline (and) household debt was already at record levels.
“We can’t avoid the need to borrow money to get by until the economy recovers but we should be disciplined about it.”
Mr Albanese accused Prime Minister Scott Morrison of “leaving people behind” as income support schemes JobKeeper and JobSeeker were scaled back.
“Worse than that, he’s kicking people while they are down. By December, 700,000 vulnerable Australians will have their payments cut when they can least afford it.
“Australia needs leaders who are prepared to tackle the big challenges facing our nation and its people. Yet Mr Morrison has no jobs plan. He has no plan for growth. No plan for skills training.
“Mr Morrison dislikes having to take responsibility unless it involves political gain.”
He said many people were forgotten in the JobKeeper scheme, including casuals, artists and university staff, and the COVIDSafe App did not prove as successful as anticipated.
“JobKeeper was poorly targeted.
“Students working a shift a week for pocket money were suddenly eligible for $1500 a fortnight in JobKeeper assistance - while single mums who worked long hours as casuals and had children to feed were ineligible.”
Mr Albanese also pointed to government mishaps, including its recent $4.5 billion allocation to “clean up the mess” of the NBN and sports rorting scandal.
In order to generate economic activity, he said the federal budget needed to prioritise job creation and allow investment in social housing, early education and universities, and roads and railways across the country.
“Above all, the budget must invest in our nation’s greatest resource - our people. That should include attacking the skills crisis created by seven years of Coalition neglect and inaction.
“With record levels of debt, massive deficits and the economy in recession, every dollar of new spending must be used to protect jobs, create secure jobs, train and upskill Australians and support those who need help to pay the bills and put food on the table.
“Any new spending is borrowed money. It can’t be wasted on mates, or rorts, or dodgy deals, or pork-barrelling.”

As restrictions ease in Queensland, the state has recorded another day of no new cases, one day after three new cases were confirmed.
Queensland has recorded no new cases of coronavirus overnight with only eight active infections remaining across the state.

A new border battlefront has erupted as Queensland now has only eight active COVID-19 cases and the state recorded no new infections on Monday morning.
Three cases were confirmed on Sunday, one was a returned overseas traveller in hotel quarantine, and the other two were crew members on board a ship off Cairns.
It comes as the deputy Prime Minister is demanding the Queensland Government tear down the border and end hard closures in order to bring the country back together.
Monday, 28 September – coronavirus cases in Queensland:• 0 new confirmed cases• 8 active cases• 1,157 total confirmed cases• 1,099,835 tests conductedSadly, six Queenslanders with COVID-19 have died. 1,141 patients have recovered.#covid19 pic.twitter.com/LNQTsuGYGC
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk earlier issued a stern warning about new waves of coronavirus that are “wreaking havoc around the world, claiming lives and ravaging economies.”
Speaking on Sunrise on Monday morning, Michael McCormack said it wasn’t “good enough” that Australians couldn’t move freely within their own country.
“We want the Premiers of those states who have still got very tight lockdowns to ease those restrictions,” Mr McCormack said.
“Because what we need to have are planes back in the air. Planes in the air means jobs on the ground. People want to travel, particularly as we approach these warmer months where people want to go on holidays and they want to catch up with their loved ones over Christmas.
“It’s not good enough that we’ve got tight lockdowns, border restrictions that are preventing many people from travelling where they want to be around this great nation.”
COVID-19 restrictions in Queensland continue to ease, despite pressure from federal politicians to open the state’s borders soon. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Dan PeledSource:News Corp Australia
It comes as Queensland marks its first weekend of being reopened to the ACT, after border restrictions eased on Friday. Family and friends were able to visit loved ones in aged care homes and hospitals for the first time in over a month on the weekend, as restrictions on visiting also eased.
Further easing of restrictions will come into place from this Thursday, when the border zone is extended to allow easier travel between Queensland and Byron, Ballina, Lismore, Richmond Valley and Glen Innes shires in northern NSW.
Double the amount of patrons will be able to sit outside at pubs, beer gardens, and cafes from Thursday, when density restrictions move from one person per 4 sqm to one per 2 sqm.
Stadium capacity will also increase from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, in time for the Brisbane Lions to face off against the Richmond Tigers in Friday night’s AFL qualifying finals.
It has been, pre than two weeks since a known case of COVID-19 was out within the community.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/breaking-news/olivia-muranga-diana-lasu-haja-timbo-to-face-court-over-alleged-covid19-fraud/news-story/3448c339e841e1d0209bc73afda3dcf7
The women allegedly responsible for Queensland’s most recent COVID-19 clusters have fronted court for the first time.
The young women accused of being at the centre of Queensland’s most recent COVID-19 clusters have fronted a Brisbane court for the first time.
Diana Lasu, 21, Olivia Muranga, 20, and Haja Timbo, 21, face up to five years’ jail and a $13,000 fine after they allegedly deceived authorities about where they had been when they returned to the sunshine state.
The trio appeared briefly in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday charged with fraud and providing false or misleading documents.
As well as not sitting together or speaking, the young women also appeared separately before the magistrate.
Timbo had her case adjourned to October 21, while Lasu and Muranga’s matters will be heard on October 28.
The women remain on bail and are not required to attend court next month if they are legally represented.
A large media contingent was waiting as they exited the building one at a time, flanked by family and their lawyers.
They refused to answer questions or make a statement.
Lasu and Muranga contracted COVID-19 while in Victoria in July.
They infected at least three other people and sparked numerous contact tracing alerts.
Timbo did not contract the virus.
At the time, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was “furious” after it was revealed the women flew from Melbourne to Sydney before landing back in Queensland on July 21, allegedly lying on their border pass about the fact they had been in the southern hotspot.
At the time, Queensland’s borders were closed only to Victoria.
The fraud charge relates to the allegation they dishonestly “gained a benefit of avoiding the mandatory 14-day self quarantine period”.
Lasu and Muranga spent days in the community while infectious, shutting down schools and shopping centres.
The pair have also been linked to southeast Queensland's biggest cluster in months, which sparked outbreaks in the Queensland Corrective Services Academy, Brisbane Youth Detention Centre and Ipswich Hospital.
One of the women worked at Parklands Christian College as a cleaner for three days while infectious, prompting it to close while all students and staff underwent mass testing.
One of the women’s sisters became infected, resulting in the after hours school care facility she worked at to close.
Two diners at a restaurant at Sunnybank, who ate at the same time as one of the women, also contracted the virus.
Thousands of Queenslanders came forward to get tested in the aftermath.
Queensland’s chief health officer has said on numerous occasions that the state’s latest cluster, which was first picked up in a woman in her 70s who worked at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre, is almost certainly linked to the two infected women.
While health authorities still haven’t determined the missing link between the cluster of more than 50 people and the women who returned from Melbourne, Dr Jeannette Young said she was confident they were connected.
“That’s the most likely scenario and even more likely after doing more testing out there and not finding any other chains of transmission,” Dr Young said earlier this month.
“We didn’t find the first cases in this cluster, we found a subsequent case and that’s why it’s taken longer to get on top of it.”
Queensland’s latest cluster forced gatherings to be limited to just 10 people in metropolitan Brisbane, Ipswich, and the Gold Coast as well as restrictions placed on aged care homes and hospitals.
The region marked 14 days of no new community transmission late last week, sparking an easing of restrictions; however, Dr Young has warned against complacency.

Contact tracers have issued a COVID-19 warning to people who visited a popular Gold Coast venue.
A GOLD COAST venue has been added to the state’s list of contact tracing alerts as Queensland celebrates another day with no new COVID-19 cases.
Locals who spent time at the Royal Pines Resort on August 24th between 7.45am and 3pm are being asked to watch out for symptoms of the virus.
It is understood an individual spent time at Tees Club House Restaurant and the Golf Shop while infectious.

Contact tracers are looking to get in touch with anyone who had face-to-face contact with a confirmed or probable case for more than 15 minutes in total over the course of a week.
For example, having three chats of five minutes each over seven days is considered 15 minutes total contact.

Close contacts are also people who have shared an enclosed space with a confirmed or probable case for more than two hours.
The news comes as the state announces the expansion of border zones further south into New South Wales.
“We have not seen cases in the border zones for quite some time and we have not seen cases north of Sydney,” Chief Health Officer Dr Jeanette Young said.
“We have now not seen a case infectious in the community since the 10th of September which is really good.”
There are currently two active cases of the virus on the Gold Coast, bringing the city’s total since the pandemic began to 199.
As of Tuesday morning 900 locals are still subject to quarantine notices.

A man in his early 70s has died in a Sydney hospital after he was diagnosed with coronavirus, as NSW recorded just two new cases overnight.
A man in his early 70s has died in a Sydney hospital from COVID-19, as authorities scramble to contain the potential spread of the virus by a cabbie who drove for nine days while possibly infectious.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Sunday that the man died in Royal North Shore Hospital on Saturday after contracting the virus from a Sydney CBD cluster.
“He got the disease from one of the CBD clusters recently and unfortunately succumbed to the disease,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this very difficult time.”
It takes the state’s COVID-19 toll to 55 and is NSW’s first corona-related death since August 16.
NSW recorded just two new cases from 13,635 tests - one is a man who is believed to have contracted the virus from Liverpool Hospital and the other is an returned overseas traveller in hotel quarantine.

NSW Health are undertaking a massive contract tracing campaign after the taxi driver worked for more than one week and visited a number of locations across western Sydney and the South Coast.
Three different local health districts are trying to track down people who may have come into contact with the man last week.
NSW Health said the man had the COVIDSafe app, which is being used to track the potential spread.
Authorities are casting a wide net and urging anyone to be aware of symptoms if they caught a taxi in western or south-western Sydney in the past fortnight.
The man worked as a taxi driver at Moorebank, Bankstown, Chipping Norton, Liverpool, Lidcombe, Warwick Farm and Milperra from September 7 to 10, and 14 to 18.
NSW Health issued an alert for five venues across western Sydney and the South Coast after the man visited them over the past several weeks.
Anyone who visited the following venues for at least an hour at the following times has been urged to get tested and isolate for 14 days regardless of the results;
* Mama Wok, MacArthur Square Campbelltown - September 9 1.30pm-2.30pm
* Milton Ulladulla Ex Servos Club – September 12, 2pm-6.15pm
* Carlo’s Italian Restaurante Bar & Seafood, Ulladulla – September 12, 8pm-9.30pm
* Bannisters Pavilion Rooftop Bar & Grill, Mollymook – September 13, 12.30pm-2.15pm
* Campbelltown Golf Club, Glen Alpine – September 16, 2pm-4.30pm
Anyone who attended the Picnic Point Bowling Club (September 18, 3pm-6pm),  Campbelltown Golf Club course Glen Alpine (September 16, 9.30am-2pm) and  Wray St Oyster Shed Batemans Bay (September 12, 12pm-1 pm) should also monitor for symptoms.
Meanwhile, the NSW government has announced workers without leave entitlements will be eligible for a one-off $1500 payment if required to self-isolate or quarantine.
NSW has opted into the federal government’s Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment scheme, which was announced in August.
Under the scheme, a state of emergency must be declared to be eligible, however the Morrison government relaxed the criteria after being approached by the NSW Premier.
“NSW is successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic, including through contact tracing and the country’s highest testing rates,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“By introducing the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment we are ensuring we continue to do everything we can to protect the community against undetected transmission.”

There have been three new cases of coronavirus  in NSW, including a hospital worker at Concord who was treating COVID patients.
There have been three new cases of coronavirus diagnosed in NSW up to 8pm on Friday night.
Of the new cases announced on Saturday, two are from hotel quarantine, while one was locally acquired with no known source.
The mystery case worked at Concord Hospital while potentially infectious, Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
The case had cared for patients with COVID-19, and further investigation is underway to identify how the infection was acquired.
More than 15,000 tests were conducted on Friday, though Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been pushing to get the number above 20,000 leading into the school holidays, when families in Sydney are expected to scatter into the regions for a getaway.
Three new cases of #COVID19 were diagnosed in the 24 hours to 8pm last night and one previously reported case has been excluded.Of the three new cases: - 2 are returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine - 1 is locally acquired and under investigation pic.twitter.com/ptM0cPa9d0
Dr McAnulty said while the number of locally acquired cases in the last 24 hours, and over the past few days, has been low, the virus is “likely circulating among people in the community with mild symptoms”.
“As such, the risk of outbreaks and a resurgence of cases remains,” he said.
“It’s vital that everyone who does have the virus is tested and diagnosed, in order to stop further spread to others.”
Anyone with even mild symptoms, like a runny nose or a scratchy throat, is urged to come forward for testing.
There are currently 83 active cases of coronavirus in NSW, with four of those in intensive care.
Two of the ICU patients are currently being ventilated.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has hit out at the Queensland government, questioning how her state will ever meet their border “benchmark”.
Restrictions on gatherings and visitors to aged care and hospitals will ease in parts of southeast Queensland, as the state records no new cases.
Deputy Premier and Health Minister Steven Miles said it was great news that there had been no new cases of community transmission in the last four days.
It’s been more than two weeks since confirmed COVID-19 cases were out in the Gold Coast and Darling Downs communities, prompting health authorities to repeal restrictions.
Gathering restrictions to allow 30 people, and visitors will be able to return to aged care homes and hospitals in those areas. There will also be an easing of PPE requirements.
Restrictions in the Greater Brisbane area will ease only when there has been no community transmission in the West Moreton, Metro South, or Metro North Health and Hospital Service areas in 14 days.
It comes as it’s revealed Queensland is considering softening the requirements to reopen the border to New South Wales.
The chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young has previously been vocal about wanting 28 days straight of no community transmission in NSW before reopening the borders, something NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has repeatedly called a “tall order”.
Every time a new case with no known source is recorded in NSW the clock resets to zero, which happened on Tuesday. The last time NSW recorded 14 days of no community transmission was in mid-June.
Pressure is mounting on the Palaszczuk government to lift restrictions for people coming from the ACT, after South Australia eased their border measures.
Mr Miles said they would continue to monitor the situation in other states.
“It’s been 65 days since the last case in the ACT, we will take that into account when we make decisions about our borders, which we do at the end of each month,” he said.
“The ACT is complicated because it is surrounded by NSW.
“I’m keen to look at what South Australia has done.”
Addressing the possible easing of the border “benchmark”, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the possible new goal of 14 days straight without a case set by Dr Young was still a tough ask.
“If you look at any proposed definition of a hot spot, there isn’t any hot spots in NSW,” she said on Wednesday.
“I’d be arguing there’s no reason for the border to be closed today. We only had four community transmissions overnight all from existing clusters and no unknown cases.
“There’s no basis to have the Queensland border shut. I would argue that even the 14 day limit is potential unrealistic.
“I am relieved that she [Palaszczuk] has put impossioble benchmark to an unhighly unlikely benchmark. But by anyone’s definition at this point in time NSW doesn’t have any hot spots.”
Mr Miles said further genomic testing had shown all cases in recent clusters in the state’s southeast have all been confirmed to be “very closely related.”
“It’s been at least five days since cases were related to clusters in the state’s southeast,” Mr Miles said.
Mr Miles said while southern states were making positive headway in driving down new COVID-19 case numbers, he reiterated how important it was to protect Queensland.
“More people have lost their lives in the past 24 hours in Victoria than in the entire year in Queensland,” he said.
But the Tourism Queensland chief executive officer has spoken to Dr Young and asked if she would consider slashing that to 14 days, something she is reportedly considering, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.
Daniel Gschwind said he was hoping it would be urgently changed.
“We believe such a high bar is going to be very hard to achieve. It is almost aiming for elimination, which appears to be a far-off objective,” he told the Herald.
Dr Young said she was still concerned by the number of cases in NSW with unknown causes of transmission.
“We’ve all done so well to protect Queensland and we can’t let our hard work and sacrifices go to waste by rushing a critical decision,” she said on Tuesday.
Changing the requirement from 28 days to 14 days would need to be agreed to by chief health officers in other states and could be discussed when the Palaszczuk Government reviews border restrictions at the end of September.
For people flying straight from Canberra to South Australia, there will no longer be a requirement to quarantine. People who drive through New South Wales will still need to quarantine for 14 days.
The push to soften the border restrictions comes as The Australian reports the Palaszczuk Government had spent more than $500,000 on coronavirus polling in the past few months to gauge voter sentiment about the state’s restrictions.
Queensland first shut its borders on March 26, and reopened to all but Victoria on July 10. On August 8, the door slammed on NSW and the ACT.

A Dubbo business has doubled its workforce despite  Australia being in the midst of its first recession in 30 years as families prepare to spend summer at home.
COVID-19 is behind a rise in the number of families digging deep to enjoy more time in their own backyards, according to Dubbo pool installers.
Dubbo Regional Council data shows the number of pool builds is up 6 per cent in 2020 when compared to the same time last year and if the experience of installers is anything to go by, that trend is being replicated across western NSW.
Narellan Pools Dubbo owner Meagan Reaks estimates sales have gone up by 30 per cent.
“The biggest thing that pools compete with are overseas holidays and caravans, and because they’re really off the table at the moment, we’re not competing with those things,” she said.
“The other day we had a person who was going to buy a caravan buy a pool instead because they said there was no point at the moment.
“A lot of people are stuck at home, looking in the backyard and we’ve definitely noticed a massive increase in sales.”
A surge in demand, coupled with federal government JobKeeper payments, has allowed the business to hire more staff and rebound from the shock of when the pandemic began.
“Initially when the coronavirus hit in March there was a lot of panic with people pulling out of pool contracts,” Ms Reaks said.
“It was really scary times for us, especially coming off the back of a three-year drought.”
Nautical Pools owner Greg Hodgkinson said his workforce has doubled because of the boom in pool sales.
“This year’s gone crazy and I think it is because people are holidaying at home,” he said.
“I’ve got a heap of work ahead of me at the moment.”
Ahead of work trips to Orange and Mudgee, Mr Hodgkinson said demand for news pools was up across western NSW.
Ms Reaks said her team recently completed new pool builds in Bourke, Brewarrina and Cobar.
Despite the welcome boost, she is worried about the long-term effects of the pandemic.
“I’m just worried about once the backup of the JobKeeper finishes, what’s going to happen?
“At the moment it’s just a case of ‘let’s make hay while the sun’s shining’.”

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has taken aim at Aussie states for the “economic impacts” of their border closures and COVID-19 restrictions.
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has championed one state’s COVID-19 response over all other jurisdictions, adding fuel to the country’s incessant border fire.
“In the last 24 hours, you’ve seen 17 cases in New South Wales,” he told ABC’s 7.30 on Wednesday night.
“But you haven’t seen their border closed like you’ve seen in Queensland or Western Australia. They’ve managed to deal with the virus much better than I think other jurisdictions have.
“You need to take into account the economic impacts of your policies and that’s why I’ve been so vocal, as well as the business community, in calling for Victoria to provide a road map out of stage four (coronavirus restrictions).”

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews plans to do just that on Sunday, while New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has announced an expansion of the bubble zone along the NSW-Victoria border to a 50km radius from Friday morning.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who faces a state election on October 31, this week revealed the state’s border would remain shut for all of September.
The Treasurer appeared on 7.30 hours after the country officially plunged into a recession for the first time in 29 years.
GDP collapsed by seven per cent in the June quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed in its release of national accounts data on Wednesday morning, following a 0.3 per cent decline in the three months to March.
Asked by host Leigh Sales if the Government was going to proceed with “planned tapering” of income support measures from this month, Mr Frydenberg said the program was “always meant to be transitioning over time”.

He noted JobKeeper was legislated for six months but will be split into a two-tiered system in four weeks and extended for another six months.
“I think it’s important to transition because outside of Victoria, the jobs are coming back,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“Seven out of eight jurisdictions are opening up and easing restrictions.
“Of the 1.3 million Australians who lost their job or saw their hours reduced to zero since the start of the crisis, we’re now seeing 700,000 or more than half come back, and of the 340,000 jobs that were created in the last two months, importantly 58 per cent of those have gone to women and 44 per cent have gone to young people.
“So there is some hope. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. We need to get the virus under control.”
Former Treasurer Wayne Swan slammed Mr Frydenberg’s remarks on Twitter.
“Frydenberg says on #abc730 the economy depends on virus control yet he bags virus control in Victoria and QLD constantly,” he wrote.

Mr Frydenberg was also questioned about comments from former Prime Minister Tony Abbott at a speech made in London overnight, when he indicated elderly COVID-19 patients should be allowed to die to reduce the economic costs.
“In this climate of fear, it was hard for governments to ask ‘how much is a life worth?’ because every life is precious,” Mr Abbott said.
“And every death is sad, but that’s never stopped families sometimes electing to make elderly relatives as comfortable as possible as nature takes its course.”
Sales asked the Treasurer, given there is no cure yet for coronavirus, whether Mr Abbott has a “point” that there are “difficult conversations that need to be had about what is a manageable number of cases, and by inference deaths, in the community at any one time”.
“I look forward to you getting all the hate mail for making that comment about Tony Abbott,” Mr Frydenberg replied.
“I mean, the reality is Tony Abbott’s entitled to his own views, and we heard from two other former Prime Ministers this week from the other side of politics. We need to manage the health response as best as we can. That’s what we are doing.”
Sales persisted with the remarks, drawing the exact ire on social media that Mr Frydenberg had predicted, however some of the reaction was directed at him.
Had ear surgery today. You know, I thought I heard the words, âdoesnât Tony Abbott have a point?â on #abc730.  Clearly have more recovering to do.
Isn't Joshy sweet, Leigh? He looks forward to you getting all the hate mail, for suggesting Tony Abbott has a point. Geez Louise. #abc730
When the majority of Australians clearly support the actions of state premiers, yet the federal government see fit to run constant interference, we are shown how utterly bereft of ideas, leadership and policy they are. #auspol #abc730
#abc730 and @leighsales seriously countenancing that Tony Abbott's reprehensible suggestion that there's a number of deaths we can regard as acceptable to keep the economy going is the lowest point in journalism I can recall.
“Regardless of how he framed them, at the core of it is the point if we wanted zero deaths from coronavirus, we could lock everyone up indefinitely. If you didn’t care, you could let everyone out and go with herd immunity,” Sales said.
“Presumably we have to land somewhere in the middle of it. Isn’t it a conversation that needs to be had about what it looks like?”
It was at that moment the Treasurer heralded the coronavirus response in the Liberal Party-governed state of NSW.
“We’ve never been seeking to eliminate the virus. That’s important to make that point. Our strategy is about suppression,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“That’s why the contact tracing and testing is so critical.”
A HEARTBREAKING DAY FOR AUSTRALIA
Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Frydenberg said the GDP figures were “sobering” and “heartbreaking”.
“Behind these numbers are heartbreaking stories of hardship, being filled by everyday Australians as they go about their daily lives,” he said.
“Be it the tourism operator in Cairns. The tradie in Melbourne. The cafe worker in Adelaide. The domestic flight attendant in Sydney. They have all been hit hard by COVID-19.
“The road ahead will be long, the road ahead will be hard, and the road ahead will be bumpy.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the economic figures represented a “heartbreaking” day for the nation.
“This is a devastating day for Australia,’’ he told parliament.
“Our Australian economy has been savaged by the COVID-19 global pandemic and recession. It is delivering an awful and heartbreaking blow to Australians and their families all around the country.
“Australians know why we are now in a COVID-19 recession. And they also know, as the government has known, that this day, as I said, would come. The government has acted to protect lives and livelihoods.”

Photos of crowds gathering at beaches across Sydney show the city is on track for “ensuring a risk of continued community transmission”.
Photos of packed beaches across Sydney have sparked fears of a second wave of COVID-19 in NSW, with a leading epidemiologist saying the beachgoers are “putting the whole community at risk”.
Police were called to three different beaches in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on Sunday as the temperatures were the warmest since late May. Police said they attended one event at Gordons Bay with 50 to 60 people.
“In NSW it’s a worry. We’re still having low levels of cases and we haven’t eliminated community transmission,” Professor Nicholas Talley from the Newcastle University School of Medicine and Public Health, and editor-in-chief of the Medical Journal of Australia told news.com.au.
“Outside is better than inside, but in crowded spaces, where people weren’t socially distancing, there’s a risk. We know superspreader events can occur and one person can infect many others.
“It’s a formula for ensuring a risk of community transmission continues.
“I know there’s fatigue and it’s really understandable. But I think at this stage, crowds on beaches, indoors and outdoors just shouldn’t be permitted. It’s understandable but it’s putting the whole community at risk,” Prof Talley said.

Asked whether or not an outbreak could have already taken place, Prof Talley said it couldn’t be predicted.
“It’s impossible to know,” he said.
Prof Talley said about 20 per cent of people infected with coronavirus are responsible for most of the spread of the virus – “presumably because of the viral load”.
He said for these kinds of large, outdoor gatherings to be safe in NSW, the rate of community transmission will have to continue to fall to “pretty much zero”.
“That’s the sign that it’s reasonably safe, but then, you’ll still need to socially distance.”
Waverley Council, which manages Bondi and Bronte beaches, said in a statement on Sunday evening they were “pleased with visitor behaviour” at public beaches and parks yesterday.
“The majority of people were social distancing by 1.5m apart and did not gather in groups of more than 20 as per the current public health orders,” the Council said.
The Council said crowds peaked at 3pm and visitors mostly complied with a 4sq m per person rule, and were monitored by rangers and via drone.
“We remind the public that we are still in a pandemic and we need to adapt our behaviour to that reality. If our public places look busy, please come back another time or use that time to grab a coffee or a bite to eat and support our local businesses.”
NSW reported 10 new cases of COVID-19 overnight, with four linked to the growing Sydney CBD cluster.
Four new locations have been added to a list of affected venues, with new cases confirmed at a childcare centre and a shopping centre in Sydney’s north shore, as well as an urgent warning for bus passengers to immediately isolate who travelled on the X39 service which left Pitt St opposite Australia Square in the city at 6.08pm and arrived at Clovelly and Carrington Roads at Randwick at 6.40pm on Thursday, August 20, after two commuters tested positive.

A childcare worker in Sydney’s upper North Shore has tested positive to the virus after working while infectious but without symptoms.
A childcare centre in Sydney’s northwest has been closed for deep cleaning after a staff member tested positive to COVID-19.
The employee worked at Reddam Early Learning Centre at Lindfield while unknowingly infectious for three days between August 25 and 27.
The positive case is a household contact of a previously reported case linked to the CBD cluster and will be included in Monday’s figures.
There are now 28 cases linked to the CBD cluster, with five more recorded on Sunday.
The news comes after NSW Health issued an alert for passengers who travelled on the X39 bus which left Pitt St, opposite Australia Square, at 6.08pm on August 20 and arrived at the corner of Clovelly Rd and Carrington Rd, Randwick, at 6.40pm.
People on-board are now considered close contacts and must get tested and self-isolate.
A positive case, who was wearing a mask, travelled on the bus, and another passenger has since tested positive.

Multiple venues in Sydney are on high alert after NSW announced six new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday - five with no known source.
The cafe at Sydney’s Royal Hospital for Women has been closed for cleaning after a new COVID-19 case, linked to the City Tattersalls gym, visited the Randwick precinct on Tuesday morning.
Health warnings have also been issued for an Apple store and an office building in the CBD after NSW recorded six new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday — five with no known source.
The hospital case, who visited the Windscreens Café in the building’s foyer, developed symptoms later in the day.
NSW Health said the hospital took all appropriate actions to respond and there was no ongoing risk to patients, staff or visitors.
“The Royal Hospital for Women is working with the local public health unit to identify and provide information to all close and casual contacts,” it said in a statement.
The case will be counted in the public health update on Thursday.
NSW Health now consider anyone who attended the City Tattersalls Fitness Centre on Pitt St in the CBD between 8am to 2pm on August 19, 21 or 23 to be close contacts.
They are asked to get tested and isolate for 14 days.
Two cases linked to the gym also travelled by bus on routes 339 or the X39 to and from Randwick to Martin Place on August 21, 22 and 24.
People who attended the 7:40pm Active Dance class at Virgin Gym Zetland are also considered close contacts, while other people who attended the gym between 7.30pm and 10pm are also asked to be tested.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant told reporters Wednesday’s cases included a man and woman in their 40s from western Sydney, who are considered household contacts of each other.
One of them is a trainee bus driver who worked while infectious for one day, and was wearing a mask at the time.
Dr Chant said contact tracing of passengers was under way, but “we do think the risk to passengers is very low”.
The trainee bus driver worked on August 20, 21 and 24 on Blacktown, Rouse Hill and Mt Druitt routes.
Anyone who used the routes is urged to be aware of symptoms and immediately get tested if they develop.
Dr Chant said anyone who was at 300 George St in the CBD on August 19, 20, 21 or 24 should be on high alert for symptoms after one of the cases worked there while infectious.
The skyscraper is across the road from busy Wynyard railway station, and central to other office buildings and food courts.
One of the new cases also went to the Apple Store on Broadway while infectious on August 22 from 3.40 to 4.40pm.
Two of the new cases attended the City Tattersalls Fitness Centre on August 19, 21 and 23.One was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine.
The other three locally-acquired cases were a man in his 60s, a woman in her 40s, both from southeastern Sydney, and a woman in her 30s from Sydney.
Three schools have also been forced to close due to possible cases of coronavirus in students, related to one of the locally-acquired cases.
Riverstone High School, Wyndham College and Schofields Public School, all in Sydney’s northwest, will not be open for on-site learning on Wednesday.
The campuses will be cleaned and students are being tested.
From these schools, a year 12 student is being retested after their first test was inconclusive, another teenager was “clearly positive” and two other children have tested negative but will be retested as a precaution.
These cases are not included in Wednesday’s numbers.

A damning investigation into the deadly Newmarch House outbreak has detailed how shortfalls became worse as virus cases grew.
Newmarch House endured a “vicious cycle” of staff shortages and inadequate protective gear during a COVID-19 outbreak that led to the death of 19 residents, a damning report has found.
An independent review into the 65-day outbreak at the aged care facility in Sydney’s west that was commissioned by the federal health department was released on Monday.
Seventy-one cases of coronavirus among residents and staff were recorded in the outbreak, which began on April 11 and was declared over on June 15.
“Until they were rectified, staff and PPE shortages and the presence of COVID-19-positive residents in different zones of the home undoubtedly contributed to infection prevention and control breaches and ongoing transmission of COVID-19,” the report authors, Professor Lyn Gilbert and Adjunct Professor Alan Lilly, found.
Relatives were left in the dark about their loved ones because of poor communication, leadership was felt to be “invisible” and managers reported conflicting advice from government agencies.
The review found one of the biggest challenges was in providing enough skilled staff to provide personalised care to residents.
The workforce of nurses and carers was severely depleted early on in the outbreak, as many staff members were close contacts of confirmed cases and had to self-isolate.
The situation was worsened by initial confusion about the correct use of PPE when caring for COVID-19-free residents, leading to more staff having to quarantine.
Most remaining staff continued to provide care but many were fearful of entering the workplace, leading to late-minute cancellations and absenteeism.
The report found increasing numbers of COVID-19-positive residents in the home were a continued source of infection to residents and staff because of imperfect infection prevention and control practices.
“Throughout April 2020, COVID-19 cases among residents and staff continued to increase, fuelling a vicious cycle of staff and PPE shortages, suboptimal infection prevention and control practice, infection source control and the resulting increase in workload and COVID-19 transmission,” it said.
At the end of the outbreak, 37 residents and 34 staff tested positive and 19 residents died, with 17 deaths directly attributed to COVID-19.
Medical and clinical care was delivered mainly by the Hospital in the Home program, but there were “significant impediments” to implementing it given there weren’t enough staff aware of the residents’ care needs.
The problems led to an external management team from Baptist Care being appointed on April 23 by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.
Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck said the lessons learned from the outbreaks were being implemented to improve management of future outbreaks.
Opposition aged care spokeswoman Julie Collins said history had repeated itself across multiple Victorian aged care homes, and the issues identified in the report were not fixed by the Federal Government in time.

A hotel quarantine guard who tested positive to COVID-19 has been fined twice for going shopping while he was meant to be isolating.
A security guard stationed at Sydney’s quarantine hotels has been fined twice after going shopping when he was supposed to be isolating.
Police said the guard, a 22-year-old man, was tested for coronavirus about 5pm last Thursday and told to go straight home and isolate for 14-days.
Instead, police said he travelled to Westfield Shopping Centre Burwood in Sydney’s inner west and went shopping for two hours.
He allegedly visited a number of stores, including Kmart and Woolworths.
The following day police said the man also left his home and went to a government services building in Elsie St, Burwood before his test result came back positive about 8am on Saturday.
Police said he was immediately transferred to a NSW Health COVID-19 quarantine facility where he would stay for the remainder of his quarantine period.
The Campsie man was issued with the two fines by NSW Police about 10pm on Sunday night.
Shoppers who visited the Westfield in Burwood have been told to watch for symptoms after the security guard visited the centre.
The man visited Kmart and Woolworths between 6.30pm and 7pm on August 20, with anyone at the shopping centre between 6pm and 7pm urged to keep an eye on their symptoms.
The man also visited Service NSW Burwood between 2.30pm and 3pm on Friday, August 21.
Anyone who attended the venues during these times are considered a casual contact and are not required to self-isolate but must monitor symptoms.
A Eden man, 46, was also fined $1000 by police travelled to Victoria on a permit that he did not meet the requirements for.
A licensed premise on Darlinghurst Road, Potts Point, allegedly with an incorrect COVID-19 safety plan, no marshal, and mingling patrons with no physical distancing, was also fined $5000 for breaches of the Public Health Act.

Most Australians believe this is the perfect way to keep people employed during the coronavirus pandemic and help the planet at the same time.
Double the amount of regional Australians are without work, but new polling reveals tree planting and river restoration could keep them employed as part of the COVID-19 recovery.
It comes as data reveals more than 80 per cent of Australians think the Morrison Government should fund environmental initiatives to create more jobs for the more than 1.4 million people looking for work.
There has been a 134 per cent increase nationally in people actively looking for work through the Federal Government’s Job Active program over the first half of 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some areas of regional Australia, that figure is much higher.
Many regions around the country are still reeling from the devastating 2019 bushfire season, and many are battling with the ongoing drought. Communities have been left to struggle further as COVID-19 put twice as many people out of work.
In Queensland, more than 51,000 people are without work in the Wide Bay and Sunshine Coast region, which was ravaged by bushfires in 2019. At the end of 2019, there were just 23,641 people without work.
Further west, the Wivenhoe region, dealing with the ongoing impacts of drought, has more than 30,000 jobseekers, a 150 per cent increase since the end of 2019. It’s a similar story in the Somerset region, where 59,840 people are actively looking for work in June, up from 23,371 six months prior.
In far west NSW, a region devastated by ongoing drought, 7627 employable people are without work. In the Murray Riverina region, more than 10,000 people are on the Job Active caseload.
On the mid-north coast, Job Active cases have jumped from 14,666 in March to 22,956 in June.
On Victoria’s south coast, 6594 people are on JobActive, up from 3191 in December 2019.
A recent poll, commissioned by the National Landcare Network, found 76 per cent of Australians were concerned about the health of the country’s environment, and a similar number agreed that economic stimulus funding should be used to help communities and the environment recover from bushfires and drought.
“Australians are overwhelmingly supportive of COVID-recovery initiatives that can keep people in work while also helping damaged landscapes recover,” National Landcare Network CEO Jim Adams said.
“They see that practical initiatives to help plant trees, restore degraded river systems and eradicate noxious weeds and feral animals are an ideal way to help improve our landscapes while also ensuring communities survive this tough period.”
In order to keep people employed while Australia recovers from COVID-19, an alliance of more than 70 conservation and farming organisations is calling on state and federal governments to fund thousands of jobs undertaking “practical conservation activities” like planting trees, removing weeds and restoring rivers.
Pew Charitable Trusts deputy Pepe Clarke said more people working to help the environment would benefit the planet.
“Given the clear evidence of people struggling to find work, it would be great to see the Federal Government responding to this strong public support for funding practical conservation and land management work while the economy recovers,” Mr Clarke said.
The conservation job creation economic stimulus option came in as the second most popular (75 per cent support) out of 12 options for keeping people in regional communities employed, second only to increasing funding for training and apprenticeships.
By comparison, only 47 per cent of those polled supported subsidies for private home construction and renovation, the model for the Federal Government’s HomeBuilder Scheme.

A Melbourne aged-care facility at the centre of a large COVID-19 outbreak and multiple deaths has been hit with a fresh blow.
A Melbourne aged-care facility with the state’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak is facing legal action from a top-tier personal injury law firm.
Carbone Lawyers launched the class action action against Epping Gardens aged-care facility, where 205 infections have been linked to and multiple deaths.
Head of personal injury law and litigation Jack Karantzis said: “We fight for the rights of the vulnerable who have been affected by mismanagement, greed and incompetence. Such conduct is abhorrent and unacceptable in a civilised society.”
Australian Medical Assistance Team (AUSMAT) personnel, usually sent to overseas disaster zones, were deployed to nursing homes across Melbourne, including Epping Gardens.
Patient vans queued outside the facility in Melbourne’s northern suburbs as gravely ill residents were rushed to hospital.
Epping Gardens’ parent company, Heritage Care Pty Ltd, which has nine for-profit aged-care homes across Sydney and Melbourne, is directed and owned by multi-millionaire aged-care moguls Tony Antonopoulos and Peter Arvanitis.
Heritage Care was contacted for comment.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/travel/travel-news/virus-experts-testify-at-melbourne-hotel-quarantine-inquiry/news-story/34f690ec5ebd4836759432e768a9be30
About 90 per cent of COVID-19 cases can likely be traced to a family who quarantined at Rydges, not leaving the hotel during their stay.
About 90 per cent of Victoria’s COVID-19 cases are likely traceable back to one family who quarantined at Melbourne’s Rydges Hotel in Swanston St, an inquiry has heard.
But precisely how the virus escaped from hotel quarantine remains a mystery, with investigators unable to pinpoint the moment of transmission.
The remaining cases in the state are likely connected to another quarantine hotel, the Stamford Plaza, an expert says, with 99 per cent of all current cases linked to the bungled hotel quarantine program.
Giving evidence to the Melbourne hotel quarantine inquiry on Tuesday, epidemiologist Dr Charles Alpren said the department of health had concluded almost all cases circulating in the state could be linked back to the hotels.
The Stamford Plaza outbreak has two origins, one man and a couple who quarantined there.
MOMENT OF TRANSMISSION A MYSTERY
The moment the virus was transmitted from the family to staff members remains unknown. It could have been a direct transmission of the virus, or picked up from surfaces, Dr Alpren said.
There were two instances of contact identified in his report: the family was approved to walk outside their room, during which time they were accompanied by security guards, and nurses had to assist the family after a contamination issue in their room on May 18.
But no cases have been identified from either of these two events, Dr Alpren said.
He had no information about how the virus in positive cases at Stamford Plaza spread out into the community.
WHERE THE CASES CAME FROM
The family of four returned to Australia on May 9 and entered quarantine. After they all developed symptoms they were moved to the Rydges Hotel on Swanston St on May 15.
On May 25, three staff members developed symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19, Dr Alpren said, later saying he believed the three people included both staff at Rydges and external contractors.
By the end of the month, the department received data suggesting the first confirmed COVID-19 case in a staff member was connected to the family.
The family did not leave the hotel during their stay and were supervised when outside their room, Mr Alpren said.
At the Stamford Plaza hotel, the data shows the outbreak can be traced back to two separate origins, one man and a couple, who were quarantined at the hotel.
There were only two isolated exceptions to the hotel clusters identified by the department, involving four people in total, his statement said.
Mr Alpren added as he gave evidence there was a third exception: an asymptomatic case detected on June 19 that was genomically linked to the virus circulating in March.
Although a large number of cases have not been genomically sequenced, Mr Alpren said he could be very certain based on the available data that the vast majority were linked back to the hotels.
EXPERTS TO JOIN DOTS
The inquiry has been set up to consider what went wrong in the bungled scheme, in which private security firms were contracted by the Victorian government to guard quarantined guests.
On Monday, Doherty Institute professor Ben Howden told the inquiry genomic data suggested more than 99 per cent of Victoria’s current cases stemmed from returned travellers in clusters that emerged in mid-May, as the early wave of the virus died out.
Hotel quarantine was in place from late March, suggesting breaches of the system were the origin of the current outbreak.
Dr Alpren, who manages, analyses and reports COVID-19 data as part of his work in the Intelligence section of the Victorian COVID-19 response, is expected to join the dots, the inquiry heard Monday.
Genomic data allows for clusters to be identified by looking at the genetic code of virus samples, which “essentially act as a passport stamp” allowing scientists to trace where it came from.
Epidemiology looks at how a disease moves in the community, taking into account where a person lives, who they have contact with and risk factors.
Combined, the two branches “allow us to provide very strong inferences of how a disease is transmitting or moving”, Mr Howden said.
After one day of evidence the inquiry has already revealed government agencies were confused about who was ultimately in charge of running hotel quarantine, which was set up in just 48 hours.
An expert also labelled two sets of advice on personal protective equipment given to security staff at the hotels — one from the federal government, the other from the Victorian department of health — as “inappropriate” and “inaccurate”.

One of the new cases, a staff member at Chopstix Asian Cuisine at Smithfield RSL, has no known source.
Nine new cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in NSW, including two connected to an outbreak at Smithfield RSL that currently has no known source.
Dr Jeremy McAnulty said on Saturday that one of the nine cases is a staff member at Chopstix Asian Cuisine in the Smithfield RSL, the source of which is currently unknown. A second staff member has also tested positive, thought to be a secondary infection from their colleague.
The other cases all have known sources: one student at Tangara School for Girls, one person who attended the Mounties Club at Mount Pritchard, and five close contacts of confirmed cases.
People who dined at the Chopstix restaurant between July 31 and August 9 must monitor for symptoms and immediately get tested and self-isolate if any present.
A case also dined at the Rick Stein at Bannisters restaurant in Mollymook. People who were there on August 1 between 8pm and 10.30pm for at least one hour must get tested right away, and self isolate until midnight tonight.
Dr McAnulty said maintaining a high level of testing is “vital” as the virus continues to circulate in the state.
Over the 24 hour period in which the nine cases were detected, 27,389 tests were conducted.
Currently 129 people are being treated for the virus in hospital. Seven are in intensive care and five of those people on ventilators.
The state’s death toll remains at 53.

Shirts off at 9am, bikinis in the parks, and packed beaches amid a genuine heatwave – welcome to summer 2020 in the United Kingdom.
There’s shirts off at 9am, bikinis in the parks, and packed beaches amid a genuine heatwave in the UK.
The English have actually not been whingeing Poms this week, it’s been hot. So hot, records have broken. There were six consecutive days of more than 34 degrees for the first time since 1961.
In a country where air conditioners are scarce, it has been uncomfortable.
The nights have been sticky, often more than 20 degrees, and did I mention there’s no airconditioning.
The lockdown has eased in London, but most people are still working from home despite Boris Johnson’s pleas to get them back into the office.
This week, people were starting to crack and they wanted to go back into work, not for the commute, or the conversations with workmates, but the airconditioning.
But there has been salvation. My local pool has reopened and I managed to get a swim for the first time in five months. The pool has been opened for lap swimmers but kids are still banned because there is no chance of getting them to social distance.
After 30 minutes on the phone to get a code for the new booking app, I ambitiously picked the fast lane but there was no petrol in the tank on the first few laps. It felt like the first session of pre-season footy training.
However, in the UK, the standard of swimming is not what you get in the pools in Sydney or Melbourne, where lap swimmers can sometimes be confused with Kieren Perkins or Ian Thorpe.
The word fast, when it comes to pool lane, is fairly subjective.
The shirts off trend is quite extreme though. I saw a bloke near a children’s playground with his shirt off at 11am on a Sunday. In Australia, you would call the police, but it was tolerated here.
Speaking with friends and relatives in Australia, it feels like the world has turned upside down. They are stuck inside in the cold under strict lockdown, while I’m sweating through Australian-style summer heat.
The UK Eat Out to Help Out campaign is another odd contrast; trying to get people to lose weight, tick, but then offering half price chips.
The half-price meals have been working, cafes have been full early in the week when the discounts have been in place.
And the cafes, pubs and restaurants need all the help they can get after the UK announced a 20.7 per cent plunge in the economy – the worst in Europe – pushing it officially into recession.
More than 750,000 jobs have been lost, and the furlough scheme, similar to Australia’s JobKeeper, expires in October.
That’s when the downturn will become an economic tsunami.
The shops have already started to stock Christmas decorations, but many people won’t be able to afford them this year unless a vaccine, most likely produced by Oxford University, can be fast tracked.
But for now, I’m enjoying the summer while it lasts.

Liverpool Hospital and Dooleys Lidcombe Catholic Club have joined the list of venues that mean visitors need to isolate or watch for symptoms.
NSW Health has issued a new public health alert for Liverpool Hospital and Dooleys Lidcombe Catholic Club after a third COVID-19 case was confirmed in a staff member at Liverpool Hospital.
The staff members with COVID-19 are in isolation and all close contacts have been told to isolate for 14 days and get tested.
The first staffer identified is linked to a known cluster and the contract tracing team is working on identifying others that may have been affected.
“There is no evidence that there is ongoing risk in the hospital, and patients should continue to visit to receive the medical care they need,” NSW Health said.
However those who were at Liverpool Hospital on 6 August from 7am to 3pm, 7 August from 7am to 3pm, and 8, 9 August between 5am and 1.30pm are advised to monitor for symptoms and get tested should even the mildest symptoms develop.
A second case has also been confirmed in a worker at the Dooleys Lidcombe Catholic Club with the source under investigation.
It means anyone who visited the club during the following times must self-isolate and get tested. Close contacts must remain in isolation for 14 days after they last attended the club, even if they test negative for COVID-19:
• Friday 7 August from 5pm to 6.30am on Saturday 8 August
• Saturday 8 August 4.30pm to 11.30pm
• Sunday 9 August 1pm to 9pm
• Monday 10 August 12pm to 9.30pm.
It comes after a number of Sydney shopping centres have been added to the list of NSW places attended by people who later tested positive for COVID-19.

NSW Health on Thursday identified Westfield Liverpool, in Sydney’s southwest, had been attended by a previously reported case of COVID-19 while infectious on August 7 along with 5th Avenue Beauty Bar in Wetherill Park on August 8.
“Patrons and staff at these venues are considered to be casual contacts and advised to monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, and immediately self-isolate and get tested for COVID-19 should symptoms develop, however mild,” the department said.
Five venues including Castle Towers Shopping Centre in Castle Hill, Westfield Parramatta and Ikea Rhodes were identified on Wednesday while a public health alert regarding Bunnings Campbelltown was issued on Saturday.
An employee at the Bunnings store tested positive for COVID-19 after working three shifts but had been wearing a mask and practising social distancing, the health department said.
Alerts were also issued on the weekend for St Agatha’s Catholic parish in Pennant Hills after a case attended early masses at the church on August 6 and 7 “prior to the onset of their symptoms”, and PharmaSave in Cherrybrook where a staff member – wearing a mask during their shift – worked on August 6 before they also developed symptoms.
A cluster at Tangara School for Girls in Cherrybrook, in Sydney’s northwest, had also grown to 19 cases by Wednesday.
Earlier this week, NSW Health confirmed two people “who were infectious with COVID-19” attended Wildginger restaurant in Huskisson, on the state’s south coast, on August 8. All patrons and staff who were at the venue between 7.45pm-10.30pm are considered close contacts.
The cluster at the Mounties club in Mount Pritchard, of which 116 coronavirus cases have so far been linked according to the health department, is no longer listed and The Apollo Restaurant and Thai Rock, both in Potts Point, have also been removed.
“Locations are removed when 14 days have passed since the last known date that a confirmed case was associated with the location,” NSW Health says.
There were 12 new coronavirus cases announced on Thursday including five in hotel quarantine. The health department also reported the death of a woman in her 80s with COVID-19, linked to the Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral cluster in Harris Park.
Read the latest list of locations from NSW Health below.
STAY ISOLATED FOR TWO WEEKS
The health department advises anyone who went to these locations during the time and date indicated to immediately self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they were there.
You should get tested for COVID-19, even if you have no symptoms, and get retested if any symptoms appear.
“Even if you get a negative test, you must stay in isolation for 14 days as it can take 14 days before you may show symptoms or test positive,” NSW Health says.

A big licensed club in western Sydney is among the latest venues to have a COVID-19 scare, with guests needing to watch for symptoms.
NSW Health has issued a new public health alert for Liverpool Hospital and Dooleys Lidcombe Catholic Club after a third COVID-19 case was confirmed in a staff member at Liverpool Hospital.
The staff members with COVID-19 are in isolation and all close contacts have been told to isolate for 14 days and get tested.
The first staffer identified is linked to a known cluster and the contract tracing team is working on identifying others that may have been affected.
“There is no evidence that there is ongoing risk in the hospital, and patients should continue to visit to receive the medical care they need,” NSW Health said.
However those who were at Liverpool Hospital on 6 August from 7am to 3pm, 7 August from 7am to 3pm, and 8, 9 August between 5am and 1.30pm are advised to monitor for symptoms and get tested should even the mildest symptoms develop.
A second case has also been confirmed in a worker at the Dooleys Lidcombe Catholic Club with the source under investigation.
It means anyone who visited the club during the following times must self-isolate and get tested. Close contacts must remain in isolation for 14 days after they last attended the club, even if they test negative for COVID-19:
• Friday 7 August from 5pm to 6.30am on Saturday 8 August
• Saturday 8 August 4.30pm to 11.30pm
• Sunday 9 August 1pm to 9pm
• Monday 10 August 12pm to 9.30pm.
It comes after a number of Sydney shopping centres have been added to the list of NSW places attended by people who later tested positive for COVID-19.

NSW Health on Thursday identified Westfield Liverpool, in Sydney’s southwest, had been attended by a previously reported case of COVID-19 while infectious on August 7 along with 5th Avenue Beauty Bar in Wetherill Park on August 8.
“Patrons and staff at these venues are considered to be casual contacts and advised to monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, and immediately self-isolate and get tested for COVID-19 should symptoms develop, however mild,” the department said.
Five venues including Castle Towers Shopping Centre in Castle Hill, Westfield Parramatta and Ikea Rhodes were identified on Wednesday while a public health alert regarding Bunnings Campbelltown was issued on Saturday.
An employee at the Bunnings store tested positive for COVID-19 after working three shifts but had been wearing a mask and practising social distancing, the health department said.
Alerts were also issued on the weekend for St Agatha’s Catholic parish in Pennant Hills after a case attended early masses at the church on August 6 and 7 “prior to the onset of their symptoms”, and PharmaSave in Cherrybrook where a staff member – wearing a mask during their shift – worked on August 6 before they also developed symptoms.
A cluster at Tangara School for Girls in Cherrybrook, in Sydney’s northwest, had also grown to 19 cases by Wednesday.
Earlier this week, NSW Health confirmed two people “who were infectious with COVID-19” attended Wildginger restaurant in Huskisson, on the state’s south coast, on August 8. All patrons and staff who were at the venue between 7.45pm-10.30pm are considered close contacts.
The cluster at the Mounties club in Mount Pritchard, of which 116 coronavirus cases have so far been linked according to the health department, is no longer listed and The Apollo Restaurant and Thai Rock, both in Potts Point, have also been removed.
“Locations are removed when 14 days have passed since the last known date that a confirmed case was associated with the location,” NSW Health says.
There were 12 new coronavirus cases announced on Thursday including five in hotel quarantine. The health department also reported the death of a woman in her 80s with COVID-19, linked to the Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral cluster in Harris Park.
Read the latest list of locations from NSW Health below.
STAY ISOLATED FOR TWO WEEKS
The health department advises anyone who went to these locations during the time and date indicated to immediately self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they were there.
You should get tested for COVID-19, even if you have no symptoms, and get retested if any symptoms appear.
“Even if you get a negative test, you must stay in isolation for 14 days as it can take 14 days before you may show symptoms or test positive,” NSW Health says.

The latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment shows pessimism has plunged due to fears more states than Victoria will suffer a second wave of COVID-19 cases.
Consumer confidence in Australia has plunged almost to the depths seen in April when the nation entered lockdown, with pessimism in NSW outstripping coronavirus-stricken Victoria, which may prove to be a big over-reaction, economists say.
The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell to 79.5 this month, from 87.9 in July and not far the extreme low of 75.6 seen four months ago.
Westpac economist Bill Evans said a sizeable fall in consumer sentiment was expected after Victoria entered stage 4 restrictions and evidence emerged of hot spots in New South Wales, but the scale of the decline came as a major surprise.
The biggest shock was sentiment in NSW collapsing by 15.5 per cent to 77.8, eclipsing Victoria’s 8.3 per cent fall to 78.
Even in Queensland, where cases have been largely eliminated, there was a fall of 8.1 per cent to 79.7.
“While some of the weakness in NSW and Queensland will reflect the direct economic drag from Victoria’s lockdown and the closure of interstate borders, the overall response seems disproportionate to the evidence on developments around the virus,” Mr Evans said.
“This emphasises the fear of the unknown.”
He said consumers across the nation appear to have been rattled by the developments in Victoria and fear other states may also succumb to a second wave.
But after more than a month, there has been no evidence that clusters in NSW will develop into a Victorian-style disaster.
“Our view is that these fears are likely to have become overblown,” Mr Evans said.
“While consumers are right to be concerned, virus risks still look low outside Victoria.”
Fears should ease as and when lockdown measures in the state start to improve the situation.
The index in South Australia fell by 5.8 per cent to 81.8 while only Western Australia was relatively stable, dipping by 1.5 per cent to 85.9.
CommSec noted that nationally, consumer views on economic conditions over the next 12 months had hit 11-year lows and unemployment expectations were the highest in more than 6 years.
The index was based on survey responses from 1200 people and conducted last week.

While most other sports are bracing for a drop in participation due to the coronavirus, Cricket Australia is optimistic the opposite will occur at local cricket clubs this summer – particularly in women’s ranks.
Cricket is confident it can defy the COVID-19 uncertainty stalking its international schedule and actually boost grass roots numbers this summer.
As most organised sports around the country suffer a massive downturn in junior registration, cricket has recorded a 3.8 per cent increase in registered participation in its annual national census, and hopes that lift will only increase, particularly in the girls’ ranks, on the back of the women’s World Cup.

Tennis has experienced a renaissance in court bookings during the coronavirus crisis, motivated by Australians wanting to get outdoors and exercise, and cricket is hopeful of riding a similar wave once the new season starts as another socially distanced sport.
“I’m optimistic. I hope it’ll be boosted and there is some evidence around that suggests that might be the case,” Cricket Australia’s community cricket boss, Belinda Clark, said.
“Cricket is a bit like tennis, you can be socially distant playing cricket, it’s not like the football codes. I think we’re in a good position there.
“We’ve had competitions already playing who have managed to cope with the guidelines and the restrictions in place.
“All the indicators are suggesting that mum and dad actually want their kids back out and playing and I think adults want to get back to their social norms as well.
“We’re reasonably optimistic, but not withstanding there are parts of the country including the one I’m sitting in (Melbourne) that are under a bit more duress than others at the moment.”
Cricket’s boost in registration comes after three years of decline, while the game is also claiming there are more than one million school kids playing cricket across the country in the school yard.
However, Cricket Australia’s focus has turned to concentrating on registered participation, people choosing to play cricket in competitions and programs outside of school hours.
Female participation has grown to 76,400 – an 11 per cent increase year on year – and it’s hoped that’s only the tip of the iceberg following the boom success of the women’s World Cup which culminated in 86,000 fans at the MCG for the final.
Cricket Australia has found that the increased numbers in junior competitions means more and more girls are able to play against girls their own age.
“I think if anything, the World Cup provides a green light for kids who are interested, for it to be somewhat normal for girls to pick up a bat and ball,” Clark said.
“That experience, I’ll never forget it in my lifetime, but (it was) just absolutely amazing. 86,000 people watching a game of cricket played by women on the MCG, it was amazing.
“I think it’ll have a big impact, but it’s a generational type shift.
“I think we’ve gone from six per cent total participation for girls some four years ago and now it’s up just over 11 per cent.
“It’s taken lot of hard work to get that doubled and we’re not finished.
“We’re committed to making sure that continues to grow and there will be a point in time we look back on and say that World Cup was a catalyst to get from 11 per cent to somewhere up near 20-25 per cent.”
‘World class’: Perry anoints teen prodigy
— Jocelyn Airth
Seven years ago, Hayley Silver-Holmes was taking selfies with Australian cricket star Ellyse Perry.
Now, the kid from Bowen Mountain is getting ready to play her third WBBL season alongside her old sporting idol at the Sydney Sixers.
But even today, Silver-Holmes admitted that she can’t believe she gets to call Perry a teammate.
“I’ve idolised her since I started (playing cricket), the person she is, how great of a sportswoman she is, I’ve always wanted to be like her, to play with her is something special,” Silver-Holmes said.
Perry said that Silver-Holmes has impressed her since she debuted for the Sixers as a 15-year-old back in 2018.
“She’s an incredibly talented cricketer who possesses a level of maturity and understanding about her bowling that is beyond her years,” Perry said.
“It’s also a wonderful opportunity for our club and Cricket NSW to play a continued role in Hayley’s development. She has the potential to be a world class T20 bowler.”

In her first two WBBL seasons, Silver-Holmes played 28 matches and claimed nine wickets.
Last year, the 16-year-old became the second youngest NSW Breaker to debut in the Women’s National Cricket League.
Silver-Holmes said she is excited to continue developing her game under the guidance of Perry and the Sixers.
“It’s unreal to be playing, getting signed for my third and fourth season, it’s an exciting time for women’s cricket coming up and I’m glad to be part of it” Silver-Holmes said.
After watching her former teammate 18-year-old Annabel Sutherland debut for Australia during this year’s T20I tri-series, Silver-Holmes said she is determined to take her game to another level this summer.
“I played with Annabel in South Africa for the Under 19s … seeing her play in the Aussie team really inspires young girls like myself and Stella (Campbell) to want to get there too” Silver-Holmes said.

The national cabinet has agreed to keep caps on international arrivals in place to avoid putting strain on the hotel quarantine system.
International arrivals to Australia will remain banned or restricted to some capital cities for months under an extension of tough COVID-19 rules.
Restrictions on outbound travel by Australian citizens and permanent residents remain in place, once again suggesting that the chances of a trip to Bali or Fiji over the summer school holidays before a coronavirus vaccine is developed remain slim to none.
On Friday an extension to the extraordinary limits on international passenger arrivals was confirmed following a meeting of the Prime Minister and state premiers over video link.

RELATED: Victoria’s new lockdown rules explained
“We also agreed that international travel constraints on inbound arrivals to Australia should be continued in their current form,‘’ the Prime Minister said.
“We look forward to, at some point, that might be able to be altered. But at this point, we are not going to put any further strain on the quarantine arrangements around the country and they will remain in place now for some months.”
In a statement released on Friday afternoon, the Prime Minister confirmed that the national cabinet had agreed that existing caps on international passenger arrivals would continue in order to manage and maintain quarantine arrangements across jurisdictions.
RELATED: Grim prediction for Australia’s outbreak
The current restrictions will remain in place until October 24, when they will be reviewed by state and federal officials.
The limits are as follows:
Melbourne – no international passenger arrivals;
Sydney – limit of 350 passenger arrivals per day;
Perth – limit of 525 passenger arrivals per week;
Brisbane – limit of 500 passenger arrivals per week;
Adelaide – limit of 500 passenger arrivals per week;
Canberra, Darwin – passenger limits on each flight to be discussed with jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis;
Hobart – no international flights.
The Prime Minister said the government was also “stress testing” the hotel quarantine arrangements in the wake of the Victorian COVID outbreak.
“There was also a very strong focus today on stress testing our national preparedness more broadly, specifically in the area of quarantine, as well as in aged care preparedness,‘’ Mr Morrison said.
“There was a report from Jane Halton who’s been undertaking that quarantine, a review. She’s been in two states now in New South Wales and up in Queensland. And there were some very good lessons and experience that she was able to pass on the need to ensure we conduct quality and assurance testings at the state level over these quarantine arrangements.”

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/patrons-at-two-newcastle-venues-ordered-to-selfisolate-after-infectious-sydneysider-visited/news-story/941547dd4b1779c0bf0c711b20b08528
Newcastle residents who visited two popular venues last week have been told to self-isolate for 14 days after a Sydneysider visited while infectious.
A pub and a club in the NSW Hunter region are the latest venues to close for deep cleaning after a person from Sydney visited while infectious with COVID-19.
NSW Health issued a warning on Sunday night, urging anyone who visited Hotel Jesmond (July 29 between 7.30pm and 9.30pm) or Wallsend Diggers (July 30 between 7.30pm and 9.30pm) to self-isolate for 14 days
“Get tested regardless of symptoms, but you must remain in isolation for the full 14 days even if your initial test is negative. If you do develop COVID-19 symptoms, you should be retested,” the statement said.
It is understood a confirmed Sydney case visited Newcastle on July 29 and 30.
The venues were deep cleaned overnight.
Dr David Durrheim, public health controller for Hunter New England Health’s COVID-19 response, said the local health department was still working to contact patrons who were at the venues because they “may be at risk of infection”.
“This action (isolating) is vital to limit the spread of the virus,” he said.
“I encourage everyone to follow directions they receive about home isolation and quarantine, and maintain COVID-safe practices.”
A drive-through testing site is in operation at the nearby University of Newcastle. Otherwise, locals can be tested at 4Cyte Pathology’s COVID-19 clinic at Central Church, Warners Bay.
The news comes as a health alert was issued for a church in Sydney’s inner west.
St Brigid’s Church in Marrickville posted a statement to Facebook explaining a couple who attended Vigil Mass on July 25 at 5pm have since tested positive for the virus.
Acting parish priest Fr Erick Niyiragira said he was notified by NSW Health that the couple was deemed “low risk” because health authorities believe they were not infectious at the time.
“As a precautionary measure, our church was closed today until further notice and will undergo a deep clean tomorrow, in line with NSW Health guidelines,” he said.
Anyone who attended the Vigil Mass on July 25 does not need to self-isolate but should get tested if they show any symptoms.
“We have encouraged our parish staff and Passionist community to be tested and to isolate until their tests results are back,” Fr Niyiragira said.
NSW recorded 12 new coronavirus cases on Sunday. Only one was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine.
Ten were linked to known clusters or close contacts and one case remains under investigation.

Health authorities say wearing a mask in NSW is a “fourth line of defence” as the state records a dozen new cases of COVID-19 overnight including in a childcare centre.
NSW residents are being encouraged to wear masks as the state records 12 new coronavirus cases overnight, including a worker at a Merrylands childcare centre.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Sunday said the health advice had been raised and there were now four key areas they wanted people to wear masks.
– ENCLOSED spaces and sites that cannot guarantee social distancing: such as public transport and buying groceries;
– STAFF in customer facing roles such as hospitality and retail;
– PLACES of worship including churches, synagogues or mosques;
– YOU live in an area where there is high community transmission or a number of cases.
Masks are being encouraged as the “fourth line of defence” following social distancing, hand hygiene, and getting tested if you have symptoms and self-isolating.
“I want to stress it is not compulsory, but it is a strong recommendation from Health, given where we are in the pandemic, given the risk posed from Victoria and given the rate of community transition in NSW,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“I myself, when I next go grocery shopping, will be wearing a mask.
“If I were to catch a train I would wear a mask and if my community had high rates are increasing rates of community transmission, I would wear a mask.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison was quick on the uptake, posting a picture of him wearing a mask barely an hour after the announcement was made.
Ms Berejiklian encouraged people to continue to get tested if they had slight symptoms, adding the next few weeks were “make or break” for the state.
More than 22,400 tests were conducted on Saturday with 12 new cases confirmed on Sunday.
Of the new cases, one was a traveller in hotel quarantine. Three cases had been to the Apollo restaurant in Potts Point on July 25. Two cases attended the Mounties club in Mount Pritchard on July 23.
Five of the 12 cases are close contacts of known cases, and one case is locally acquired with no known source identified.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said that person was a childcare worker who attended the Advanced Early Learning Centre in Merrylands while infectious between July 27-29.
“A second case has been reported this morning in another staff member at that centre,” Dr Chant said.
“The centre is currently closed for cleaning close contact tracing is underway.”
One case counted in Saturday’s numbers was a member of the Court at Toronto and attended the courthouse on Monday, July 27. The person was likely infected at the Apollo restaurant, the Department of Communities and Justice said in a statement.
The courthouse was being cleaned as precaution on Sunday and all close contacts identified were being contacted.
Anyone who attended the Toronto courthouse between 7am and 2pm on July 27 should get tested if they have symptoms.

Dr Chant said another case attended the Canterbury-Hurlstone Park RSL on Monday July 27 from 6.30pm-8pm.
Patrons and staff who attended the club at the same time should also monitor the symptoms.
At least 103 people are being treated in hospital for the virus with eight in intensive care.
No deaths were recorded, keeping the state’s death toll is steady at 52.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said it supported the new health advice.
“What we see in NSW is a consistent low level transmission which is why they have gone to a higher level,” he said.
“They are in a position that Victoria was in over a month ago, and yet they have maintained those numbers.
“The option remains for higher levels in any jurisdiction, at any time dependent on that community transmission.”

Police intend to charge two people with breaching COVID-19 restrictions after they were found in the back of a truck.
Two people who allegedly attempted to enter Queensland stowed away in the back of a truck are set to be charged.
Police are investigating the incident after new border restrictions came into effect early on Saturday morning, barring millions of Australians from the sunshine state.
Anyone who lives in, or has visited the Greater Sydney area or Victoria in the last 14 days will be turned away at the Queensland’s borders. Residents who want to return home but have been to any COVID-19 hot spots will have to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days at their own expense.
The closure comes as Queensland this week reported its first cases of COVID-19 community transmission in months.
Deputy Premier and Health Minister Steven Miles said on Saturday that police were investigating the alleged truck stowaway incident.
“They will be charged with breaching COVID travel restrictions,” he said.
“That will send a message to anyone who thinks they can get around our restrictions that police are checking vehicles.
“You will be caught and the penalties are significant.”
Mr Miles added that in the last 24 hours, 81 people had been refused entry to the state.
“Queensland Police intercepted 76 passengers on 76 different flights and we processed 5975 people at our airports,” he said. “Of them, 114 were diverted to hotel quarantine and one was refused entry and turned around at the airport.
“At our road borders, 6745 vehicles were intercepted, 80 people were refused entry and 35 were directed to hotel quarantine.”
The border shutdown comes after a coronavirus scare in the state, prompted by two women who returned from Melbourne via Sydney and ignored quarantine rules, continuing to go about their business while infectious.
The two women, and a third woman who travelled with them but did not test positive, have since been charged with fraud and providing false information to border authorities.
The closure has brought chaos to the state’s border checkpoints, with massive traffic queues building up as police struggle to process the vehicles.
Mr Miles said in the hours before the new enforcements came into place, there had been reports of 90 minute waits.
By Saturday morning that had dropped back to 10 minutes, he said.
Earlier this week push notifications were sent to border declaration pass holders, with police urging residents in the Tweed/Coolangatta area to update their information to ensure ease of access.
New South Wales recorded 17 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday and closed more venues for deep cleaning and contact training.
Meanwhile, the Northern Territory has designated Greater Brisbane, Ipswich and Logan as coronavirus hot spots as of Saturday morning, the areas joining Victoria, Sydney, the Eurobodalla Shire and Port Stephens.
Anyone travelling or returning to the NT who has visited any of the declared hotspots must enter into a mandatory 14 days quarantine.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said southeast Queensland presented an “unacceptably high” health risk.
“While the numbers in Brisbane are still low, the Chief Health Officer has considered the data and advised that the risk of spread in these areas is unacceptably high,” he said.
“These areas are a threat to the Territory, so our borders will close to them.”

Fears of widespread community transmission have seen hundreds of people descend on pop-up COVID-19 testing clinics around Brisbane’s southside today.
Cars have lined up for kilometres in a rush to get tested for COVID-19 after it was confirmed two of the three women who lied upon returning to Brisbane from Melbourne tested positive to the virus.
Hundreds of cars lined up outside Orion Springfield Central shopping centre, in Brisbane’s west, on Thursday morning, creating traffic chaos as Metro South health authorities set up a COVID-19 fever clinic.
People were forced to wait up to five hours to get tested in their cars by healthcare staff armed with face shields and full personal protective equipment.
It comes as Queensland confirmed three new coronavirus cases on Thursday morning, all unrelated to feared community transmission.
One man in his 20s recently returned from the United States and is in hotel quarantine. The other two are a couple who recently returned from Sydney and chose to self-isolate after dining at The Apollo restaurant.
In Brisbane’s souths, the principal of Calamvale Community College has revealed two students, in years 1 and 5 are in two weeks’ self-isolation.  The students are related to one of the women who tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

One of the two women who defied border restrictions and returned to Brisbane on July 21 was confirmed to have dined at Peak Thai in Springfield on Sunday night.
Late Wednesday a third case, the sister of one of the pair, also tested positive. She had not returned from Melbourne.
A third woman has also snuck across the Queensland border from Melbourne. She has not yet had a positive test result but remains in isolation.
The three young women who got past border restrictions were branded “deceitful and deceptive” by Queensland Police Commissioner Kararina Carroll on Thursday.
It was also revealed mobile phones belonging to two of the teenagers were seized.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Thursday that Queensland Health had carried out 6826 tests on Wednesday, almost 1000 of those in the city’s south.
“I want to commend both health and the police for the rapid response that they have been deploying over the past 24 hours,” she said.
The Premier has urged anyone who is sick to stay home and to keep up with the social distancing, and avoid busy places like shopping centres.
“If you are sick, stay at home, do not go to work,” she said.
The chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young confirmed authorities did not know where the second COVID-positive 19-year-old had been. Dr Young said more cases could potentially be announced later on Thursday as a result of Wednesday’s testing.
“It’s too early to have got all of those results back yet. We usually get results back in 24 hours,” Dr Young said.
She said more locations could be added to the list of venues visited by the trio as one continues to work with Queensland Health to detail her whereabouts.
The other 19-year-old has so far been unco-operative.
“I am worried about the second individual who had not been co-operative and has not shared where she has been,” she said.
“People should be very cautious … this is the time to go and get tested.”

Fitness First in Kings Cross has undergone a deep clean after a person with COVID-19 took a class there last week.
Fitness First in Kings Cross has undergone a deep clean after a person with COVID-19 took a class there last week.
The gym in Potts Point, which has been placed on high alert amid a cluster of new cases, said the infected person took the class last Monday.
“Fitness First Kings Cross was made aware by the NSW Health Department that an individual who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 visited its Kings Cross club on July 20 to attend a class only, and did not use the gym floor or facilities,” a Fitness First spokesperson said in a statement.
“NSW Health has already contacted those members that have been identified as being in close contact with the person diagnosed with COVID-19.
“Fitness First Kings Cross has followed all the NSW Health recommendations and guidelines in relation to this matter, including providing them with the details of all members who are required to self-isolate as a result of being in contact with the member.
“Fitness First has been advised that all members who are required to self-isolate have been contacted and no other members, staff or visitors to the club are at risk.
“The club has undergone a process of deep cleaning in addition to increased daily cleaning that has been taking place since the club reopened in June. The club remains open and safe for all those visiting.”
The spokesperson did not say how many people were in the class.
It comes as residents in the exclusive inner-city suburb are placed on high alert after a cluster of COVID-19 cases emerged in the area, linked to both The Apollo and Thai Rock restaurants.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant urged anyone who lives in or has visited Potts Point recently to monitor for coronavirus symptoms.
“All people who live in or have visited the Potts Point area in the past two weeks should get tested if they have any symptoms of COVID-19, however minimal,” she said on Tuesday.
Fourteen new cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday, NSW Health said in its daily update today, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 3510.
There were 16,009 tests reported in the 24-hour reporting period, compared with 22,032 in the previous 24 hours.
One of the new cases was a staff member at The Apollo. Another new case was linked to Thai Rock, bringing the total there to three.
“Everyone who attended The Apollo restaurant at Potts Point from Thursday July 23 to Saturday July 25 is being asked to quarantine for 14 days after their visit,” NSW Health said. “Any diners who develop symptoms should be tested.”
Fifty-one people have died from COVID-19 in NSW. There are currently 101 cases being treated by NSW Health, five of those in intensive care with one on a ventilator.
In NSW, 2800 people are known to have recovered from the virus.

CORONAVIRUS is spreading at a rapid rate across the southern states of Australia, sparking renewed fears of infection on the Southern Downs.
A whopping 75 per cent of Daily News readers reported mounting concern for a second wave as the nation was rocked by a record of 5474 active cases and 167 deaths.
The border crossings remain Queensland's first point of defence against the virus and in the weeks since Victorians were banned, hundreds of would-be tourists have tried, and failed, to enter the Sunshine State.
Many of those were turned around at the Texas border, according to Goondiwindi Senior Sergeant Richard McIntosh.
"I couldn't tell you the exact number but there's been a lot," Sgt McIntosh said.
Prior to the complete closure of the Victorian border, there were a reported 235 motorists who were ordered to quarantine at the border within a 24-hour period.
"When (that border) shut that stopped a lot of people getting out of Victoria and assisted us at our border crossing," Snr Sgt McIntosh said.
A sneaky few, however, remained undeterred.
An explosive report by Queensland Police Service revealed more than 200 motorists who were directed to self-isolate upon entering the state subsequently went missing, and a further 185 people provided false contact information.
An 18-year-old woman from New South Wales was fined $4003 last week for providing a false declaration under the Public Health Act during a stop on Inglewood Texas Rd, while on the same day a 41-year-old man was found hiding in the boot of a car on Border St in Wallangarra.
He was also fined $4003.
Police also have to contend with motorists such as Adam Thurrowgood, who filmed himself allegedly bypassing a Southern Downs crossing and questioning the legitimacy and authority of border officers last week.
Goondiwindi Mayor Lawrence Springborg said there will always be people who do the wrong things and put others at risk, but he was confident in the work police and army officers were doing at the border.
"It's of no surprise to anyone that people in my region supported border closures previously, and they're concerned about making sure we keep safe," Cr Springborg said.
"But regardless of our opinions, it isn't decided by us.
"We act on the advice of the chief health officer and she works on evidence. She's very calm, and very capabale, and we're in safe hands so long as we follow State Government advice."
Close to 7500 coronavirus tests have been conducted on the Southern Downs since the beginning of the crisis, and there is currently just one active case in Queensland.

Up to 100 people partying in front of a DJ in a national park near Thredbo were among the rule-breakers busted by NSW Police.
Up to 100 people partying in front of a DJ in a national park near Thredbo, in the NSW ski fields, have been busted by police with a significant number detained and fined for breaching COVID-19 health orders.
The illegal bush bash was one of a number of incidents of rule-breakers caught by NSW Police on Friday and Saturday.
It comes as NSW confirmed 15 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, including eight linked to the Thai Rock cluster.
Six of the new cases are in hotel quarantine and one case is under investigation, with 30,535 people tested in the past 24 hours.
RELATED: Up to 360 new cases in Victoria
NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Scott Whyte said more than 20 people were found in two private residences and fined, along with a NSW resident recently returned from Victoria caught flouting quarantine at Mt Druitt Railway Station who was arrested.
Police Minister David Elliott said Saturday was the six month anniversary of the first positive case of coronavirus being detected in Australia.
“Us, in NSW, have shown the world what the best practice can be – but we cannot be complacent,” he said.
Stricter rules for hospitality venues came into effect in NSW on Friday.
Mr Elliott said businesses caught doing the wrong thing would be fined up to $55,000, forced to close for a week in the second instance, and closed for up to a month if they were caught breaking the rules for a third time.
“Those that want to flout the rules need to know that there is a potential six month jail sentence attached,” he said.
“I don’t want to see business owners have to go into incarceration for six months for doing the wrong thing.”
Seventeen thousand police have been deployed to managing the pandemic restrictions, with more than 20,000 compliance checks carried out on individuals in NSW.
There have been 50,000 compliance checks on businesses since March.
Assistant Commissioner Whyte said “the vast majority of people are on the journey with us” in terms of compliance with the rules and at border checkpoints.
Mr Elliott said the police were “not there primarily to punish you, they are there to protect you.”
“We don’t want a gotcha moment.
“Nearly all the resources available to government have been deployed as part of this operation, and people need to realise they need to teach every single one of them with respect.
“The biggest risk in this pandemic is ourselves.”

Mass coronavirus testing is under way in Bondi, with long stretches of waiting cars eerily similar to scenes in Melbourne in the weeks before it went into lockdown.
There was a long wait for people wanting to get tested for COVID-19 at Bondi Beach’s drive-through clinic today, with cars seen lining up from Campbell Parade to get in.
Comedian Dan Ilic also shared video of the line, with others reporting similar delays in other parts of Sydney.
One person tweeted that the scenes were similar to Melbourne prior to the lockdown, where a testing site in Chadstone Shopping Centre was swamped by carloads of people desperate to get tested.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said NSW is on “high alert”, with health advice flagging indoor venues as high risk places for transmission.
“Please, whether or not you live in a community which has had cases or not, we want everybody to think seriously about what they are doing over the weekend to make sure you avoid crowds, make sure you avoid putting yourself in a situation that will compromise your health or those of others,” she said.

“Think about the number of people you are having into your home. We know from the health advice, we know from what has happened elsewhere, the highest risk activities are those inside your on home or those inside a confined space such as a hospitality venue.”
During the first wave of the pandemic Bondi was a hotspot for coronavirus cases due to its backpacker population and a larger proportion of returned travellers calling the suburb home.
Residents were criticised for flouting social distancing and crowding Bondi Beach, forcing it to be closed in late March. as well as reports of hostels throwing large parties.
This month Bondi has come under fire again after large crowds hit the beachfront over the weekend and footage of wild private parties was shared online.

An Ikea distribution centre worker in Sydney has been struck down with COVID-19 after turning up to work while infectious.
An employee at an Ikea distribution centre in Marsden Park in Sydney’s northwest has tested positive to COVID-19.
The news was confirmed by Western Sydney Health Service’s Public Health Unit director Dr Shopna Bag in a letter sent to co-workers earlier this week.
“The staff member was infectious at work on the morning shift on the 6th, 7th and 8th of July 2020,’’ the letter stated, according to The Daily Telegraph.
It informed staff they would not have to self-isolate as a result of the COVID-19 case as they were deemed to be a “casual contact”, but that they should remain at home if they came down with flu-like symptoms such as a sore throat, fever or respiratory issues.

“We ask that you watch out for symptoms for 14 days from the last date the staff member was at work, so until July 22,’’ the letter continued.
“If you develop symptoms then we ask that you isolate yourself from the general public and please get tested.’’
An Ikea spokesperson confirmed the case to news.com.au.
“We were informed that a co-worker who works in the Ikea Australia DC/CDC located in Marsden Park, tested positive for COVID-19 on 13 July 2020,” the spokesperson said.
“They last worked at the DC/CDC on Wednesday 8th July. The source of their infection was not an Ikea unit. The unit was not instructed to close, however conducted a proactive and voluntary deep clean of the unit.
“The co-worker is in our thoughts and we hope for a swift recovery.
“Ikea Australia has been in constant contact with the NSW Department of Health and have taken their advice in response to the situation. The NSW Department of Health has advised that co-workers within the Ikea Distribution Centre, located in Marsden Park are not required to self-isolate.”

It comes as three COVID-19 cases were linked to a Thai restaurant in western Sydney, sparking an urgent warning from health authorities.
Anyone who visited Thai Rock restaurant in Stockland Mall Wetherill Park on July 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 has been told to immediately be tested and self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of symptoms.
“Anyone who develops COVID-19 symptoms should also be retested, even if they have had a negative result previously. Everyone must stay in isolation for a full 14 days even if their test is negative,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“The change in advice is due to the identification of a third case linked to the restaurant, a customer who dined at Thai Rock on 10 July.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been forced to impose tough new restrictions, with wedding guest lists again slashed and “all indoor hospitality venues” limited to bookings of no more than 10 per group.
Meanwhile, Victoria is also in the grip of a second lockdown as cases in the state soar.
So far, Australia has recorded a total of 11,045 cases of COVID-19, with 5165 in Victoria, 3346 in New South Wales, 1071 in Queensland, 444 in South Australia, 648 in Western Australia, 228 in Tasmania, 113 in the Australian Capital Territory and 30 in the Northern Territory.

Wests Tigers stars David Nofoaluma and Josh Aloiai are free to take on Brisbane on Friday night after being cleared of COVID-19.
The five Wests Tigers players and coaching staff have recorded negative COVID tests, freeing players David Nofoaluma and Josh Aloiai to take on Brisbane at Leichhardt Oval on Friday night.
There were fears Nofoaluma and Aloiai could test positive and force the shutdown of the season, but they have been given the all clear.
Development player Zac Cini and coaching staff members Simon Dwyer and club legend Brett Hodgson were also cleared.
Neither Nofoaluma or Aloiai displayed any symptoms and had passed the daily temperature and symptoms checks when they arrived at training on Thursday morning.
“COVID test completed. Great stuff by PVL and @NRL taking all measures for the safety of our players and the game,” Nofoaluma tweeted.
The seven NRL players and staff who were sent for testing on Thursday all live in the Liverpool/Campbelltown area, which has emerged as a
coronavirus hot spot after a cluster was identified at the Crossroads Hotel in Casula.
Tigers coach Michael Maguire is expecting COVID-19 testing to become a regular procedure as the game fights to protect itself from the virus and any potential shutdown of the competition.
“I’m sure those sorts of things will continue to happen (across the game) for a period of time. We understand the world we’re living in at the moment and we’ve got to do due diligence in making sure the game is safe and everyone is safe,” he said.
“One thing we’ve shown in the game is that we have to do what is needed to keep the game going,” he added. “We’re very fortunate that the game is up and about; Peter (V’landys) has done a great job with his team to get the game to where it is.
“It’s giving everyone something on a weekend to watch and enjoy, so we’ve got to do everything possible to keep it going.”
Nineteen players live in the Liverpool/Campbelltown area, where a coronavirus hot spot has emerged in Casula, and will be tested regularly to protect Queensland-based players from the risk of infection.

Usually, COVID-19 cases take days to become infections - but something strange is happening in NSW and it has experts very concerned.
The coronavirus in NSW is spreading at a “very fast” rate and some people may have passed on the virus as quickly as one day after being infected.
So far 19 people who visited Sydney’s Crossroads Hotel in Casula have got the coronavirus, and another 25 were infected through being close contacts of positive cases or going to the Planet Fitness gym, where another positive case worked out.
In less than two weeks, the virus has also spread to at least two “tertiary” cases — people who got the virus from the contact of a contact.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the tertiary cases highlighted the importance of diagnosing people really quickly.
“I think what’s been interesting is we’ve seen some acquisition which has been very short,” she told reporters on Wednesday, explaining that the incubation period for the disease was normally between one and 14 days.
“So people have developed the symptoms more towards the one day period than the 14,” she said.
“It gives you very little time for the contact traces because you’ve got to get your case diagnosed, and then you’ve got to lock down those contacts … I think it just highlights the speed.”
Professor Michael Kidd, the country’s deputy chief medical officer, today described the behaviour of COVID-19 in one patient as “unusual”.
“(The NSW patient) appears to have become infectious within 24 hours of being infected with COVID-19,” Professor Kidd said.
Typically, people infected with COVID-19 will develop symptoms within five to seven days and are usually infectious 24 hours prior to feeling ill.
Sydneysiders were first warned of the potential Crossroads cluster on Friday and in less than a week, it has now been linked to more than 40 cases.
Authorities revealed this week that a Melbourne man who travelled to Sydney on June 30 was likely ‘patient zero’. This man had gone to the pub for a party on July 3 with work colleagues, some of whom were also likely infected.
A week later authorities identified the pub as a potential hotspot of infection after two coronavirus cases both reported they had been there.
“My message to you in the community would be, if you’ve got a sore throat today, don’t wait for two days to get it diagnosed,” Dr Chant said. “Work with us, go get tested on day one because every day you can give us allows us to stop that spread.”

‘HE DIDN’T THINK HE WAS UNWELL’
While some people may be surprised at how easily the coronavirus was spread among pub patrons, Professor Peter Collignon of the Australian National University, said it fits with how the virus operates.
“Most outbreaks in Australia, such as in nursing homes, have begun with people with mild illness going to work,” he said.
Authorities said the Melbourne man didn’t think he was particularly unwell at the time or that he was sick with COVID-19.
But Prof Collignon said people who had mild symptoms were probably the most likely to spread the disease.
In the days before the group headed to the pub, the virus was transmitted to the man’s colleagues, who then likely helped spread it more widely at the venue, including to a staff member.
While it is possible for the virus to be spread through surfaces, Prof Collignon said it was probably less about infected beer glasses and more about close contact.
“The biggest risk is being in someone’s face,” he said.
The virus is mostly spread through droplets that spray when people talk, sneeze or cough.
This is one of the reasons pubs have been identified as higher risk venues because people often speak more loudly to be heard over the music, which sprays droplets further.
People also tend stand close together and mingle with others, which is why authorities have restricted venues to seated patrons only.
“It makes sense that staff got infected, and they were then likely a vehicle to spread it to others because they were in close proximity,” Prof Collignon said.

SUPERSPREADER’S HIGH INFECTION LEVEL
A superspreader may also have played a part.
“We’ve got a young bloke from that latest cluster … he had one of the highest infection levels we’ve ever seen,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told 2GB’s Ben Fordham on Thursday.
“His viral load was quite capable of spreading it to anybody near him … we all need to be on high alert.”
Superspreaders are people who are more likely to spread the illness due to a combination of factors including the characteristics of the disease, the patient’s biology and their environment or behaviour.
“Some infected individuals might shed more virus into the environment than others if their immune system has trouble subduing the invader,” Professor of Entomology and Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, Elizabeth McGraw, wrote in a piece for The Conversation.
“Additionally, asymptomatic individuals – up to 50 per cent of all those who get COVID-19 – will continue their normal activities, inadvertently infecting more people.”
One study estimated that 20 per cent of all those infected with the coronavirus were responsible for 80 per cent of all local transmission.
Prof Collignon said one person had also been responsible for an outbreak in Korea that saw one or two hundred people infected in bars.
“You tend to think your friends and family are safe,” he said. “But all the evidence suggests the biggest risk is being too close to people — less than 1.5 metres — when you are indoors.
“Some people have higher doses of the virus but it’s mostly about close contact, not that you shouldn’t continue to wash your hands.
“It’s that complacency that’s the problem.”

Former Home And Away actor Joel McIlroy will defend charges alleging he repeatedly punched a female police officer in the head, a court has heard.
A former Home And Away star accused of bashing a female police officer will fight the charges at a hearing in September after his case was pushed back due to the coronavirus.
Joel Neil McIlroy, 46, allegedly shouldercharged a NSW Police senior constable in the inner-Sydney suburb of Surry Hills on the morning of October 22, 2019.
Police allege he intervened in the arrest of someone else for minor property-related offences and was directed to leave before punching the 29-year-old officer in the face several times.
McIlroy has been charged with one count each of assaulting an officer in execution of duty causing actual bodily harm, wilfully obstructing an officer in execution of duty and resisting an officer in execution of duty, and two counts of assaulting an officer in execution of duty.
In Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday, police prosecutor Senior Sergeant Amin Assaad said he understood the charges would be “strenuously defended” and the previous estimate of a one-day hearing would need to be extended.
McIlroy’s lawyer, Sidnie Sarang, told Chief Magistrate Judge Graeme Henson the case had originally been listed in May.
“Obviously as a result of COVID, we’re seeking to relist the matter,” Ms Sarang said, noting it would “potentially” take two days.
Judge Henson said: “I remember an era when these matters were dealt with in about three hours.”
He said there were tens of thousands of cases before NSW courts as at the end of June.
“After an extensive period of reorganisation of the listing arrangements in the Local Court to meet the realities of the COVID-19 effect on society and the various public health directions the time has arrived to take what is hopefully the final step towards normalisation of listing arrangements in the Local Court,” Judge Henson said in a memorandum on July 1.
“Whilst the Local Court has continued to sit on a daily basis during the last four months it recognises that the impact of social distancing requirements and concerns within the community has had an economic impact within the legal system particularly in relation to the engagement of legal practitioners.”
He said the “initial steps towards relisting previously abandoned defended hearings”, starting with those in custody and lastly general matters, was proceeding “as well as can be expected”.
Judge Henson listed McIlroy’s hearing for the 29th and 30th of September in the same court complex and continued bail.
The actor is expected to appear on those dates via video link.
McIlroy spent more than three months behind bars before he was granted bail in the NSW Supreme Court in February.
McIlroy starred on  Home And Away as Flynn Saunders from 2003 to 2006 but first appeared on the show back in 1994.
His role, as the husband of Sally Fletcher – Kate Ritchie’s beloved character – earned him a silver Logie nomination for Most Popular Actor in 2006.
His character left the show that year after dying from cancer.
The court heard in October that McIlroy was diagnosed with Huntington’s disease a decade ago – a neurological condition which eventually took his father’s life.
“The degeneration of the frontal lobe means McIlroy is a person who cannot always control his impulses,” his Legal Aid solicitor told Central Local Court at the time.
“That is a condition that will continue to increase in terms of his impairment.”
At the same court appearance last year, a police prosecutor said in addition to the punches, McIlroy had allegedly “attempted to put an arm around her (the senior constable’s) neck”.
He said the officer would require ongoing treatment from a physiotherapist after the alleged assault left her with a dislodged vertebrae, swelling to her right cheek and soft tissue damage.
She was treated by paramedics at the scene before being taken to St Vincent’s Hospital where she was expected to be released the following day.
A NSW Police spokeswoman told news.com.au today the female officer has returned to work.

An expert has issued a stark warning about the handling of clusters at 24 aged care facilities in Victoria amid fears the death toll could drastically rise.
A divide is emerging between experts and health authorities about how best to handle coronavirus clusters at Victorian aged care facilities.
There are now 24 nursing homes where COVID-19 is spreading among staff and residents in Victoria.
At the Menarock Life Aged Care centre in Essendon, the cluster has grown to 28 cases and represents the largest single cluster in Victoria’s aged care system since the pandemic began.
Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton said on Tuesday that all infected patients at Menarock have been transferred to hospital for care.
But he rejected the notion that all aged care patients with COVID-19 should be transferred to hospitals.
RELATED: Experts say suppression was a mistake
“I don’t think it’s always the case that patients in aged care, residents who test positive, need to be transferred,” Prof Sutton said.
“Sometimes the safest place for them is to remain in that facility, but we’ll always make a consideration and it will be a clinical judgment of the treating doctor for those patients.
“Where we think there’s a risk of transmission within that facility, we will make a strong recommendation for those patients to move out to an acute health setting but it’s really done on a case-by-case basis.”
That approach is out of step with recommendations from one of Australia’s most respected epidemiologists, UNSW’s Mary-Louise McLaws.
The World Health Organisation adviser told news.com.au “all residents” with COVID-19 should be removed from aged care facilities without exception.
“All residents in aged care must be transferred from their facility into a hospital because staff in the residential aged care facilities do not have the training and skill required and resident to staff ratio is not high enough to contain and prevent wider spread of COVID-19 into other residents,” she said.
“Their transfer into hospital will prevent further spread and further associated deaths as well as reduce the risk of death in those already infected.”
Aged and Community Services Australia chief executive Pat Sparrow, agrees with Professor McLaws.
She told the ABC: “The Victorian government’s position is ‘assessment on a case-by-case basis’. Only the South Australian government has said they will automatically transfer patients who are positive into other settings. That’s something we’re hoping to see other governments do.”
Prof Sutton acknowledged the situation is “challenging”.
“Sometimes (infected) residents are looked after in place. If the isolation, single rooms, en suite bathrooms are available and those patients, residents can be managed onsite,” he said.
“In other facilities, because there’s a shared bathroom or difficulties in managing the movement of residents around the facility, they will be transferred, as has been the case with Menarock aged care.”
Victoria recorded 270 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday. Of those, 242 were spread through the community from unknown sources.
A man in his 30s is among 28 Victorians in intensive care.

A Sydney pizza restaurant and NSW Woolworths have been hit with cases of COVID-19, with customers warned to be on alert.
A Sydney pizza restaurant customer and a Woolworths staff member at Bowral have tested positive for coronavirus.
Mancini’s Original Woodfired Pizza in Belfield will close for three days after the man visited for dinner on July 10, the restaurant wrote on Facebook.
“NSW Health has advised us that we are low risk as the customer was in the restaurant for an hour and stayed within his group,” it said.
“We have given NSW Health our contacts for the night and they have all been notified and told to watch for symptoms including our staff.
“We are choosing to close the doors for 3 days from tomorrow and have the restaurant professionally deep cleaned.”
RELATED: Woolworths staff in isolation
It comes as Woolworths confirmed a staff member from the Bowral store in the NSW Southern Highlands, 110km southwest of Sydney, tested positive for the virus.
Posts on social media suggest staff were alerted at approximately 7.30pm on Tuesday night and an announcement was made within the store for all customers to leave.
Staff have been notified and Woolworths is offering full support to those required to self isolate.
In a statement provided to news.com.au, Woolworths spokesperson said: “We have been notified that a team member at our Bowral store has tested positive for the Coronavirus.
“We’re making contact with our Bowral team members and will provide our full support to those required to self-isolate in line with advice from the health authorities.
“As a food retailer, we already have very high standards of cleaning and hygiene in place. As an extra precautionary measure, the store has been closed overnight for an additional deep clean.

“While the risk of transmission to customers and team members is low, the safety and wellbeing of the local community is our priority.
“Customers and team members should be assured they can continue to safely shop and work at our Bowral supermarket.
“Any customers who shopped in our Bowral store on 12 July and feel unwell in the next two weeks should make contact with NSW Health.”

Customer notifications have been placed around the store and it reopened at 7am this morning.
On Monday night, one customer took to Twitter to complain she was the “only one” wearing a mask in store.

#BREAKING: Woolworths has confirmed a staff member from its Bowral store in the southern highlands has tested positive to #COVID19nsw. The store has been closed overnight for a deep clean.
It comes as two more COVID-19 cases were discovered in Sydney’s Crossroads Hotel cluster, bringing the total number linked to the outbreak to 30.
Two men in their 20s were confirmed as having the virus after they came forward for testing when it was revealed a confirmed case of the Crossroads Hotel outbreak visited the same gym as them.
Lockdown has been ruled out for now but positive cases from the Hotel visited a shopping centre, gym and aged care facility, sparking further concern.
Speaking to ABC’s 730, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she doesn’t want to send her state’s coronavirus-affected suburbs back into lockdown
“We don’t have an end date. What we know now is a lot more than what we knew six months ago,” she said.
“If you have a symptom, getting tested, staying home or if you have been to a venue where you know there’s been an outbreak, doing the right thing each of us.”

Earlier this month, NSW Health urged residents in Balmain to be on alert for COVID-19 symptoms after a Woolworths supermarket worker tested positive to COVID-19.
He travelled on Jetstar Flight JQ510 Melbourne to Sydney on June 26.
The man then worked at the Woolworths store Balmain on June 27 and 28.
After presenting with COVID symptoms, he had a COVID-19 test and was assessed as positive last night.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said Woolworths has been exemplary in managing the issue and ensuring all staff who may have been in contact with the man are now in self-isolation. A deep clean of the store was also undertaken.

The supermarket giant is facing a potential disruption to its meat supply as a result of the brutal coronavirus crisis engulfing Victoria.
A worrying coronavirus cluster at a Victorian meat supplier has sparked concerns of a looming shortage of products in Coles supermarkets.
Somerville Retail Services in Tottenham in west Melbourne supplies lamb, pork and beef to the grocery juggernaut – and there are now 12 COVID-19 cases linked to the company.
It has since been closed for deep cleaning in an effort to control the potential spread of the illness, and team members have been placed in isolation for testing.
A Coles spokesperson confirmed the closure in a statement provided to The Age.
“We have made alternative arrangements to protect supply for our customers,” the spokesperson said in the statement.

RELATED: What stage 4 restrictions could look like
“Our team is working hard to replenish our stores and we apologise if an item a customer wishes to buy is out of stock.”
The Somerville Retail Services website boasts it is “is one of the largest retail ready processors of retail ready meat products in Australia”.
“A family owned and operated company, we have grown from one small production line to presently supplying Coles Supermarkets in each state throughout south eastern Australia,” the site states.
“Somerville Retail Services has built its reputation on consistent delivery service, meeting our customer’s needs and having a strong quality focus.
“Our production and delivery cycle is less than 48 hours, from receiving an order to delivery to a Coles store.”
It supplies around 700 Aussie stores with various meat products.
However, it is just the latest in a string of coronavirus outbreaks to occur within Victorian meatworks, including at Cedar Meats back in May during the initial COVID-19 peak, JBS Meats and Pacific Meats.
The news comes as Victorians face the threat of an even tougher lockdown, with Premier Daniel Andrews saying stage 4 restrictions haven’t been ruled out.
The Victorian lockdown has already caused many supermarket shelves to be stripped of products as residents begin a second wave of stockpiling in preparation for the situation to worsen.
Victoria has already introduced stage 3 restrictions over metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire, with people in those areas required to stay at home unless they are shopping for essentials, caregiving, exercising or going to work or study.
During a press conference earlier today, Mr Andrews said it was possible that even tougher restrictions would soon be introduced.
“We’re not there yet,” he said, but added: “I can’t rule out we have further limits placed on people’s movement. I can’t rule that out.
“As I always said, if we’re planning for it, we’ll share it with the community.”
Meanwhile, NSW begins to record its own alarming spike in coronavirus cases, with “moronic” pub patrons in the state being blamed for a new COVID-19 crackdown after a string of new clusters was linked to pubs, clubs and casinos.
State Premier Gladys Berejiklian is set to announce the changes on Tuesday with heavy fines and tougher regulations on the collection of contact details and the size of groups.
The size of groups bookings will be slashed from 20 to just 10 under the changes, while larger venues will be limited to just 300 patrons.

Multiple people have tested positive to COVID-19 in Sydney, with health officials warning we are now at a “critical point” of containment.
NSW is now at a “critical point” of containment with five cases of coronavirus community transmission all linked to a pub in Sydney’s south west.
A man from the Blue Mountains tested positive for coronavirus yesterday after visiting the Crossroads Hotel in Casula on July 3, NSW Health confirmed this morning.
Three members of the man’s household have all also tested positive to coronavirus, however, they will be included in tomorrow’s state figures.
The new case follows the diagnosis of a woman earlier this week who had also been at Crossroads Hotel on the same night, with the “only known link” between the pair the pub.

MELBOURNE MAN TESTS POSITIVE AFTER CROSSING BORDER
There were seven new cases of coronavirus diagnosed in NSW during the 24 hour period until 8pm last night, with five of them returned travellers in hotel quarantine.
The other cases include the Blue Mountains man and a traveller from Melbourne who drove across the border and entered NSW last Tuesday.
The traveller from Melbourne is now in hotel quarantine along with three identified close contacts.
NSW Health say the man had “minimal contact” with anyone else besides these three people.
Anyone feeling unwell is being urged to get tested, with extended hours clinics now available at Liverpool, Campbelltown and Fairfield Hospitals.
“There’s been recent community transmission of COVID-19 in NSW so we’re at a critical point in the fight to contain the virus,” NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said today.
“It’s essential that we all take the risk of transmission very seriously and take steps to protect ourselves and loved ones.”
TEMPORARY CLINIC SET UP IN PUB CARPARK
Crossroads Hotel has been closed so that cleaning and tracing of patrons could take place, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard confirmed yesterday.
Under current restrictions pubs, clubs and cafes are required to keep a list of the names and contact details of all the people to attend the venue.
“So if the hotel has complied in that way we’ll have hope we would have access to those names,” Mr Hazzard said.
A temporary coronavirus testing clinic has also been set up in the pub’s carpark, which locals have flocked to today in order to get swabbed for the virus.
Lengthy queues of cars were seen snaking into the Crossroads Hotel car park this morning, where cleaners were inside the pub disinfecting the venue.
FEARS OUTBREAK COULD SPREAD TO NSW
With five confirmed cases of community transmission NSW Health are moving swiftly to try and prevent Sydney’s outbreak from spreading it did in Melbourne.
Today Victoria recorded 216 new coronavirus cases with more than 1000 active cases in the state.
It’s in stark contrast to less than a month ago, June 14, when Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews announced the state would be easing more restrictions with only nine new cases that day.
But in just a few short weeks that number skyrocketed, with clusters forming after several large family gatherings and an virus outbreak among security guards working in Melbourne’s quarantine hotels.
Allegations have since emerged that guards were sleeping with guests, not using proper personal protective equipment and allowing them to leave quarantine.
The outbreak quickly spread through Melbourne suburbs, with clusters forming in several schools and northern public housing blocks.
In response Mr Andrews announced the city and nearby Mitchell Shire would be going into lockdown for six weeks from Thursday to try and contain the spread.

Residents in Sydney’s southwest have been warned to look out for signs of COVID-19 after two cases were found to have visited the same hotel in the area.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said a 30-year-old woman from Liverpool and a man in his 50s both tested positive to the virus after visiting the Crossroads Hotel in Casula.
The woman tested positive a few days ago but the man only returned a positive test result today.
“Obviously that has major ramifications, because it appears to be, still checking, but appears to be a likely point of connection whether two people could have actually come into contact at least with the virus, not necessarily directly, but at least the virus at the same location,” Mr Hazzard said.
“As we speak, NSW Health has been in contact this afternoon with the management of that particular hotel and has asked them, in fact directed them, to close and provide all necessary details.”
Under current restrictions pubs, clubs and cafes are required to keep a list of the names and contact details of all the people to attend the venue.
“So if the hotel has complied in that way we’ll have hope we would have access to those names,” Mr Hazzard said.
A pop up testing facility will be set up in the car park of the hotel from 5pm, with people who visited the venue from Saturday night asked to get tested if they have any symptoms.
Mr Hazzard said he couldn’t say exactly how many people were at the pub on Saturday but suggested it “would have been pretty full”.

Sky News host Andrew Bolt says while the coronavirus is nasty, Victoria has had “10 times more people die of the flu just about every single flu season without anyone panicking or demanding lockdowns”. 

He said Victorians are being treated as the “lepers of the nation” right now amid a second outbreak of the deadly disease in the state. 

“New South Wales is so desperate to keep us out”. 

He said coronavirus measures need to be “smarter” and “more targeted” in the state. 

“Wouldn't it make more sense to isolate the vulnerable, quarantine strictly the sick, with a policeman at the door if necessary, and not imprison the healthy”.

Heavy traffic was experienced at Wodonga, Victoria, due to the closure of the New South Wales-Victoria border on July 8. On July 6, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the border would be closed on July 8 after a conversation with the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, in order to contain a COVID-19 outbreak in Victoria. “Normally a 12 minute journey, this morning it was just over 2 hours,” Twitter user nescanner posted with a timelapse video showing the long line of cars trying to enter New South Wales. Despite the closure, some residents are able to apply for an exemption after meeting a specific criteria. One man was arrested by New South Wales Police for trying to cross the border at Corowa without a permit on July 8. Australian Defence Force personnel would be used to ringfence the Melbourne metropolitan area, which was placed under lockdown on July 8.

Hugh Jackman, Miley Cyrus, Usher and Coldplay are some of the stars that have helped raise billions for global coronavirus relief
A star-studded concert featuring Coldplay, Miley Cyrus, Hugh Jackman, Usher and hosted by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has helped raise more than $10 billion for coronavirus relief.
The artists, who were dispersed across the world and performed separately, brought a bit of glamour to an international fundraising summit.
Global Goal – Unite for our Future: The Concert saw Cyrus perform The Beatles’ “Help!” in an empty stadium and Hudson performed “Where Peaceful Waters Flow” sailing on a boat down a river in Chicago.
Justin Bieber, Jennifer Hudson and David Beckham also made appearances.
The concert was part of huge donation drive organised by the European Union and advocacy group Global Citizen.
The summit raised 6.15 billion euros (A$10.05bn) in cash and loan guarantees to assist the poor around the globe whose lives have been up-ended by the pandemic.
Global Citizen said its summit with world leaders, including Britain’s Boris Johnson, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and Canada’s Justin Trudeau, had raised A$2.1 billion to help COVID-19 efforts in poor countries, along with a promise of 250 million doses of a vaccine for those nations if one is successfully developed.
The group said it had secured A$7.8 billion in loans and guarantees from the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to support fragile economies worldwide.
“The US$6.9 billion that was pledged today to support the world’s poorest and most marginalised communities is an incredible next step on our journey out of the COVID-19 era, but there is more still to be done, as no one is safe until everyone is safe,” Hugh Evans, chief executive officer of Global Citizen, said after the event on Saturday (US time).
“As we fight this virus, we also need to take care of the most vulnerable people and address the challenges they’re facing right now,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during the event.
Organisers said the show was not just a fundraiser, but aimed to draw awareness to the disproportionate impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on marginalised communities.
French President Emmanuel Macron said shared action was needed to defeat the virus.
“Let’s mobilise, let’s refuse an ‘every man for himself’ approach, let’s continue to move forward together. France and Europe take their responsibility today and will do so tomorrow,” Macron said.
Jennifer Hudson is taking us to 'Where Peaceful Waters Flow' 🙏  We can all do our part to put the COVID-19 pandemic to...
Worldwide, nearly 10 million people have been reported infected by the virus, and nearly a half million have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say those figures seriously understate the true toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing and missed mild cases.
About a dozen potential COVID-19 vaccines are in early stages of testing. While some could move into late-stage testing later this year if all goes well, it’s unlikely any would be licensed before early next year at the earliest.

The COVID-19 toll in New South Wales has passed 50 after a man’s death at an aged care home in April was reclassified.
The death toll from COVID-19 in New South Wales has risen to 51.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant announced the new death on Wednesday.
However, she said the 85-year-old man who was a resident at an aged care facility in Bankstown had died on April 27 but had only now been linked to the coronavirus.
“The change follows new national guidance on the classification of deaths and means NSW has now recorded 51 deaths from COVID-19,” NSW Health said in a statement this morning.
“The man was a resident of Opal Aged Care, Bankstown, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 7 April. Sadly, he passed away on 27 April, after two negative swabs had been recorded.”
Dr Chant said the “small outbreak” at the facility involved about three staff and three patients.
“The clinical treating doctor diagnosed COVID as contributing and so in accordance with the national guidelines, we’ve included that as a death and that has been updated,” she said.

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said there were four new cases recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm on Wednesday.
Three of those are travellers in quarantine and the fourth is a seven-year-old child from Lane Cove West Public School.
The school closed today for a deep clean and close contacts are being contacted and isolated.
“Fortuitously, their (the student’s) symptoms actually came on on a Saturday so hopefully there was no transmission at the school,” Mr Hazzard said on Thursday.
“The great news is the community in NSW are just fantastic, for three days in a row we’ve had more than 17,000 tests.”
There have been 3162 cases of the coronavirus recorded in the state and 2776 have recovered.
He was asked about the spike in cases in Melbourne and said “care, caution and vigilance” were necessary.
“At various points, NSW has had far more cases than Victoria and Victoria certainly didn’t close their border on us,” he said.
Mr Hazzard said people living in the state should not be expect to be “completely insulated” from local transmission of the virus, noting the Sydney school case was evidence of that.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced 33 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday.
Seven of those are in hotel quarantine, nine are from known outbreaks, six are from routine testing and 11 are still under investigation.
A “testing blitz” in 10 suburbs was also announced.
“Obviously Victoria is having some major issues, particularly in Melbourne hot spots at the moment,” Mr Hazzard said.
“This is no time for NSW residents to be complacent or cocky.”
He urged NSW residents not to visit Victoria and asked Victorians not to travel to regional NSW or Sydney.

A student at a school on Sydney's Lower North Shore has tested positive for coronavirus. 

Lane Cove West Public School is now closed for deep cleaning after the Year Two students tested positive for the virus. 

The New South Wales Department of Education said the school would remain closed to on-site learning on Thursday while it worked with NSW Health to establish close contacts. 

The school urged parents to get themselves and their children tested for the virus if they displayed even the mildest of symptoms. 

Lane Cove West Public School is the second school in NSW in under a fortnight to close due to positive coronavirus cases.

The Sydney school has now been closed, with information yet to be released about how the child in year two managed to contract COVID-19.
A student at a school in Sydney‘s Lower North Shore has tested positive for coronavirus.
Lane Cove West Public School will be “non-operational” tomorrow with classes moved online while contact tracing takes place.
“The school will be cleaned tomorrow prior to school resuming,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“The school will continue to support students with learning materials provided by classroom teachers using SeeSaw and Zoom.”
No information has been released about how the child in year two managed to contract COVID-19.
RELATED:  Military called in as Victorian cases soar
It came as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the damage caused to Victorian border towns such as Albury-Wodonga would deter any attempt to restrict movement between the states.
“For a community like Albury-Wodonga, they don’t see themselves as two separate towns, they see themselves as one community,” Ms Berejiklian told ABC television on Wednesday night.
“A hard border closure would be detrimental to a part of the country that doesn’t have cases. We’re not in the business of having hard border closures.”
Victoria on Wednesday confirmed another 20 cases of COVID-19 amid an outbreak in outer-suburban Melbourne, taking to 213 the number of diagnoses over the past 10 days. NSW on Wednesday reported 10 new cases – all in hotel quarantine – from 13,278 tests.
RELATED:  WHO warns global divide is ‘accelerating’ virus
Ms Berejiklian has repeatedly criticised interstate travel restrictions and said she won’t agree to border closures with any of NSW’s neighbour states.
But she again urged against travel to Melbourne, particularly its six current COVID-19 hotspots: the local government areas of Hume, Casey, Brimbank, Moreland, Cardinia and Darebin.
Residents of those hotspots should not be moving around the community, the premier said, and NSW businesses should deny service to anyone from outer- suburban Melbourne.
She also implored NSW residents to avoid visiting Melbourne altogether. But Ms Berejiklian said she was confident her Victorian counterparts would get the outbreak under control before drastic measures were required.

About 3159 COVID-19 cases have been reported in NSW to date, with none in intensive care.
Ms Berejiklian again encouraged NSW residents to seek testing if they felt unwell.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt this week said Australia’s international borders would remain closed for “a very significant” amount of time as global coronavirus infection rates accelerate, potentially until a vaccine is secured.
The number of coronavirus infections around the world has exceeded 9.3 million.

Victorians from coronavirus hotspots should be banned from entering “every business” in New South Wales, according to the state’s leader.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian today blasted visitors from Victoria saying there were “disregarding” official health advice by crossing the borders.

She also called on business owners across the state to refuse these travellers entry and service.
"They should not be travelling anywhere, let alone interstate," Ms Berejiklian said. 

 “I think it is the prerogative of every business, every organisation not to accept anyone from those hotspots at this time.

“That is basic pandemic management.”

The panel discussion will explore a wide range of issues, solutions and services aimed at helping entrepreneurs and start-ups in SA thrive.
One of those services is a new mentoring program launched under the State Government’s entrepreneurship strategy, called FIXE (Future Industries Exchange for Entrepreneurship).
There are many mentor programs and resources available to small business but this program is designed exclusively for South Australian start-ups and scale-ups.
The program matches SA start-ups with a business mentor where they’ll receive unbiased insights and advice to help them navigate through these uncertain times.
Start-ups are also encouraged to apply for stream two of the State Government’s Research, Commercialisation and Start-up Fund.
The program provides entrepreneurs with funding to start and scale their innovative early-stage business.
Entrepreneurs can apply to Stream Two via three pathways:
Bootstrap Pathway – up to $100,000 matched equally by founders with in-kind contributions and cash.
Incubator Pathway – up to $100,000 with at least 50% of the grant matched by an investor who brings value in addition to their financial investment.
Scale Up Pathway – more than $100,000 and up to $1 million with the full grant amount matched equally by investors.
Information is available at www.innovationandskills.sa.gov.au
South Australia has an amazing future and the potential to create great businesses that solve problems with global impact.
Innovation is at the heart of everything we do in South Australia.
Boosting innovation and growing the entrepreneurial and start-up culture is critical to achieving economic growth in South Australia.
The State Government aim is to make South Australia the nation’s start-up capital, with a target of the highest rate of start-ups per capita in Australia within a decade. It should become the natural home for future industries and entrepreneurship in the southern hemisphere.
Industries like space, defence, biotech, health, digital and creative are driving economic growth and creating new, knowledge-intensive jobs.
A key pillar of this strategy is Lot Fourteen
The establishment and development of Lot Fourteen is a major part of accelerating the growth of start-up businesses and making South Australia the nation’s start-up capital.
The Adelaide City Deal is a $551 million 10-year plan to grow Adelaide as an innovative and vibrant city, transforming Lot Fourteen into a hub for research, innovation and entrepreneurialism in technology and the arts.
Behind all of the development is an imperative to act now to create an environment that nurtures and encourages entrepreneurs to take risks and create the jobs of the future.
Meanwhile, Jim Whalley has been reappointed South Australia’s Chief Entrepreneur to provide strategic advice to enable entrepreneurialism across all forms of business, industry and public sector in South Australia.
Supported by Entrepreneurial Advisory Board, with a mandate to grow the start-up community and connect entrepreneurs with a network of events, mentors and investment opportunities.
The FIXE Strategy outlines a list of objectives and actions that will supercharge innovation in South Australia.
The strategy sets out how we will go about creating the right culture, improving capability and mobilising the capital required to make South Australia a global leader in entrepreneurship.
The aim – underpinned by this strategy – is to harness ideas and bring them to life in an environment where entrepreneurs are encouraged to take risks and create jobs.
The strategic focus is around four pillars – INSPIRE, EQUIP, ENABLE, CELEBRATE.
INSPIRE individuals, groups and organisations to embrace the spirit of entrepreneurship
EQUIP South Australians with the tools, mechanisms and resources to start and grow successful businesses.
ENABLE a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem underpinned by business and investment activity
CELEBRATE the achievements of entrepreneurs.

Sydney Zoo has opened its doors to visitors again on Saturday after the coronavirus pandemic shut down most of the state, with plenty of new measures now in place to protect its workers and visitors. SEE THE CUTE ANIMALS
It feels like Groundhog Day for Sydney Zoo — which is very strange indeed, because that’s one of the few animals they don’t have.
The western Sydney zoo, like many other wildlife centres, opened its doors again for the first time in months on Saturday, which vividly reminded staff — and animals — of its opening day late last year.
The zoo had only been open 109 days before going into lockdown but primate curator Lou Grossfeldt said the animals had become accustomed to interactions with the guests.
“All the animals got used to seeing people, so I think they were actually looking for them (during the lockdown) at first,” she said.
“When the lockdown happened, we felt like we were back in construction mode again.
“We’re all actually really excited to be heading back to normality.”
Ms Grossfeldt, who manages the zoo’s primates, said that a variety of procedures are now in place to guarantee the park’s opening will be a success.
“The zoo will initially be open Fridays to Sundays and school holidays only, including the public holiday on Monday,” she said.
“Our zookeeper talks including our Aboriginal Cultural Experience are suspended to avoid people gathering in one area.
“Animals will be managed as normal, so people will be able to catch a glimpse of them being fed at different times but there won’t be scheduled feedings like we used to have.
“From a keeper’s perspective we’re being very diligent, we’ve got the dedicated teams and we’ve got the sanitising stations everywhere.”
A spokeswoman for Sydney Zoo said: “During the time we’ve been closed, our animal care team has worked tirelessly to maintain the welfare of our animals, including our newest additions, three baby baboons.”
“We also welcomed two mischievous small-clawed otters that can’t wait to meet our guests.
“All guests must pre-book a ticket either online or contact our team for help if you cannot buy your tickets online. We have already received an overwhelming response and allocations are going fast.”
Tickets to Sydney Zoo are available on a per day basis and zoo staff are regulating the number of guests entering the zoo per hour.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/companies/coronavirus-warning-of-australian-dead-malls-as-a-result-of-covid19/news-story/9e08bf1ab9d088f5c7bc1c01c78609ea
Shops closed amid the pandemic but some may never reopen leading to fears the “dead mall” phenomenon seen in the US could be in store for Australia.
The sign on the darkened Pandora jewellery store at Sydney’s Top Ryde City shopping centre suggests its closure is temporary. It’s just to support “containment efforts” in relation to COVID-19.
But the fact the brand’s logo has been shoehorned from the store front hints at the truth – this store will never reopen.
Even more worrying for the centre is the hole left by the larger Harris Scarfe department store next door, which closed in March.
Shopping centres were already suffering. The pandemic has been another kick to the guts as wallets tighten and panicked shoppers flee to the safety of online. While many stores are now reopening, some simply won’t and others may succumb in the coming months.
Analysts have said while retailers still love a CBD flagship and make big profits from larger malls, mid-sized and suburban centres are now in the danger zone as big names ruthlessly run the ruler over their branch networks.
Many centres will either have to transform themselves or risk becoming the Australian equivalents of the US’ “dead” or “zombie malls”.
It’s a prediction dismissed by the shopping centre industry that has said Australian centres have advantages over US malls.

Nonetheless, some shopping centres are losing major retailers like MKR is losing viewers.
This month, Target said it would close 75 stores, many of those in modest malls. Even before COVID-19, Myer had pulled out of malls in Sydney and Brisbane while Big W has vacated four stores has around 30 left to axe. This week David Jones said it would look to slim down in size.
Dr Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia University in the US, and a former retail executive said Australian shopping centres were not immune to the forces that have rattled their US counterparts.
“The view that ‘if we build it, they will come to shop’ for decades resulted in a glut of shopping centres, increasingly undifferentiated and unproductive.”
“Along comes the internet which begins to hollow out the great American shopping centre just the same way the shopping centre hollowed out downtown retailing,” he told news.com.au.
“Then along comes COVID-19 which is going to accelerate customers’ already fevered migration over to e-commerce while at the same time likely hastening the failure of an untold number of already poorly performing retailers – and their already struggling suburban malls.”
‘B GRADE’ CENTRES AT RISK
Of the US’ 1400 centres only around 250 so called “triple A” super-regional malls remain fully tenanted, Dr Cohen said. The other 1000 plus “B” and “C” centres were struggling. If an anchor or two departed the outlook could be grim.
“These are often referred to as zombie malls because they are still open but they look to customers like they are dead or dying.”
The US is famously littered with these eerie, derelict “dead malls”. Some still sport escalators that will never run again and dust piles up on store facades that will never see another shopper.
This outcome seemed ludicrous in Australia, partly because shoppers here had been less enthused by online shopping. Not anymore.
Daniel Agostinelli, chief executive officer of footwear retailer Accent Group said online had gone from 10 per cent of sales to 30 per cent during the pandemic.
The firm behind Athlete’s Foot and Platypus said this month it could close between 50 and 100 stores.
“The only word we can find for this shift is seismic and that will have an impact on how many stores we require,” he told news.com.au.
Mr Agostinelli said that “100 per cent” mid-tier malls could bear the brunt, and he’s urged landlords to reduce rents.
“We call those B grade centres. We’re not sure what the shift to digital will mean for these centres and where this will settle at the end of the day.”
Athlete’s Foot has a shop at Top Ryde City, a centre that is an example of how some malls may have to reinvent themselves. The centre isn’t dead, but it had a near-death experience going bankrupt in 2011.
That was just two years after it opened as a fashion destination with a Myer as well as street wear brands G-Star and Glue.
They’re all gone now, replaced by less familiar names like “Mode Sage” and “Style Avenue.”
Top Ryde City insists it has turned around its fortunes. Its swerved from a focus on fashion to less exciting but more dependable categories like food. One floor of the old Myer is now a Coles; a Kmart has opened.
Current owners Blackstone had been hoping to sell the centre for $700 million, double what they bought it for post collapse, however that plan has stalled. And ominous gaps remain in the centre, particularly on floors furthest from the supermarkets.
SIGNS CENTRES ARE SUFFERING
“A couple of months ago I would never of thought I would’ve been talking about dead malls in Australia but what we’re seeing now may encourage owners of some of these mid-tier assets to think about what their shopping centres may look like in five years”, Queensland University of Technology retail expert Professor Gary Mortimer said.
“If they lose a major anchor tenant like Myer, Harris Scarfe or Target, they might decide they’re too big and knock down half the centre, make it residential.”
He said a preponderance of massage and nail salons, which don’t pay high rent, is never a good sign of a centre’s health.
Even in CBDs, some malls are doing it tough.
“Wintergarden and The Myer Centre in the Brisbane CBD are in strife and have been for some time,” he said.
Both centres still boast big names – H&M, Zara and, of course, Myer – but the further you get from the street, the more shops are shuttered.
The Co urier Mail dubbed the former the “Wintergarden wasteland” of “shop carcasses”. Last month, shopping centre staple Best & Less exited the Myer Centre.
The management of Wintergarden told the Courier Mail difficulties with street access were behind some vacancies in the centre.
Justin Blumfield, the director of shopping centre management at Vicinity Centres which owns the Myer Centre said it would, “continue to be a much-loved destination for people visiting Brisbane’s CBD.
Vicinity also owns Australia’s top performing centres – Melbourne’s bustling Chadstone which raked in $2.3 billion in turnover last year, according to Shopping Centre News.
Westfield centres in Sydney’s CBD, Bondi, Fountain Gate and Chermside as well as Melbourne Central, Sydney’s Broadway and the Gold Coast’s Pacific Fair are also flourishing. But seemingly sniffing the wind, Westfield no longer refers to its malls as shopping centres. They are now “living centres” to instill the idea they are about meeting, eating, and working out rather then just shopping.
ADVANTAGES OF AUSTRALIAN SHOPPING CENTRES
Industry body the Shopping Centre Council of Australia (SCCA) said our centres have some aces up their sleeves. One is they are generally half the size of their US counterparts which means there’s less space to fill. The other is supermarkets – you rarely see one of those in a US mall.
Supermarkets suck in shoppers which return more often. And if a big retailer departs a supermarket can move in – as Aldi is doing in place of Big W’s closed branch in Auburn, Sydney.
“Our centres are vastly different to the US, such as our much higher sales productivity, occupancy rates and share of food tenants,” SCCA Executive Director Angus Nardi told news.com.au.
“We don’t believe so-called dead or zombie malls will be an issue in Australia.”
Some retail watchers are less confident. They note department stores are vast and supermarkets can rarely soak up all the spare space.
In Fairfield, western Sydney, the closed Big W will be replaced not by a grocer, gym or a new food court – but by parking spaces.
If a big store dropped out, said Dr Cohen, “lesser malls are stuck with dark store fronts”.
“In my opinion, from afar, many if not most Australian department stores will fail over time unless they can provide differentiated assortments, great customer service and appropriate price and quality,” he said.
“Most US department stores are failing at this and it will spell their eventual downfall.”
If they do vanish, and online continues to rise, Australian shopping centre owners will have to thing on their feet to stop their location from becoming the next dead mall walking.

AS A RESULT of the recent school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wenona’s close-knit boarding community returned home to their parents and guardians, where they studied remotely at the start of term 2, through the school’s Athenaeum Learning Pathway.
Year 11 student Jada Taylor recently returned to the boarding house from her hometown of Tamworth. A rising rugby star, Jada used her time in lockdown to improve her fitness with her father and brother, using online programs set up by the Wenona sport department and coaches. While she enjoyed working on her grandparents’ property, Jada was surprised at how much she missed her friends, the boarding staff and her teachers.
“I found it tricky to sustain my studies with less face-to-face teaching,” she said. “I’m really looking forward to the help and support of the boarding supervisors again.”
While Jada’s father enjoyed having her home, he valued Wenona’s support, particularly the regular contact he had with Wenona’s head of boarding, Nonie Ayling.
“I was worried that she wouldn’t work as hard at home, but she had so much support,” he said.
Year 10 Tilly Helps, from Hillston, NSW, appreciated having time with her family and her pet lambs, but also missed her boarding family.

“I’ve realised just how helpful the boarding staff and girls are, especially through assessment and exam periods,” she said. Having Tilly home has given her parents, Nigel and Ruth Helps, an insight into her life at school. “Tilly has been very well supported through the new learning pathway, alleviating the need for parental support,” they said.
Year 10 boarder Milla Serafin spent her time on her family’s farm in Whitton, NSW. She’s also looking forward to being back in the classroom. “Milla can’t wait to see all the girls,” said her parents, Mark and Melinda. “We will miss her, but she has felt cared for and supported.”

Everyone entering Royal Randwick on Saturday will be checked by thermal cameras, the first deployment of such measures at an Australian sporting venue, as part of racing’s advanced COVID-19 recovery plan.
The Australian Turf Club is strengthening biosecurity protocols to protect punters by introducing thermal imaging cameras that monitor temperature levels of every person who enters Royal Randwick racecourse on Saturday.
The race club is the first to implement this technology at an Australian sporting venue as part of the race club’s COVID-19 recovery plan.

Owners with runners will be permitted to attend the meeting for the first time since Golden Slipper Day in late March.
Sydney and NSW racing has been the only top level sport to continue to operate through the coronavirus pandemic in the last three months although race meetings have been run before empty grandstands with only trainers, jockeys, stablehands and essential workers allowed on racetracks.
But under the approved NSW Government Public Health Order plan released earlier this week, owners who pre-register with the ATC will be permitted on track under the first phase to return spectators to Sydney racing.
ATC can also have up to 50 owners in each of the designated dining areas inside the Randwick grandstand. Social distance protocols will be strictly enforced and patrons must remain in those dining rooms for the duration of the race meeting.
After race field acceptances were taken on Wednesday for the Listed Bob Charley Stakes meeting at Royal Randwick, ATC officials issued invitations to owners with horses racing on the day to register to attend.
But for those allowed to be trackside at Royal Randwick, they can only enter if they pass through the thermal imaging camera checkpoints.
The technology is an integral part of the ATC’s biosecurity strategy to provide for the safety and security of racing, and specifically, regarding the return of spectators to race meetings.
“The thermal imaging cameras are a measure introduced by the ATC to ensure everyone is safe when they attend our racecourses,’’ ATC chief executive Jamie Barkley said.
The cameras will be in operation at venue entry points and are designed to detect elevated body temperature and provide an alert when the pre-set temperature of 38 degrees celsius is exceeded.
Licensed security operatives trained in the use and function of the cameras will be monitoring the temperature readings.
If someone is detected with an elevated temperature, that person will be moved to a separate area, isolated from other people entering the venue, and will then be questioned by medical personnel about their current state of health, recent travel schedule and people they had been in contact.
Their temperature will be re-tested and if it remains elevated, or if their answers to any questions raise a red flag, they will not be permitted onto the racetrack.


The owners who are on track this Saturday will be situated in the upper levels of the Randwick grandstand and won’t be permitted near trainers and jockeys who are quarantined on the ground level.
“It’s first in, best dressed,’’ Mr Barkley said. “If we get 200 owners in the dining areas on-course on Saturday that is a nice return for racing.
Racing NSW CEO Peter V’landys AM said: “It was always the Board of Racing NSW’s priority to allow owners back onto the racecourse first as they are the lifeblood of the industry and have kept their horses in work during this crisis.
“This is just a small gesture of our appreciation for the owners.”
ATC is hoping to gain approval for some club members to return to race meetings in coming weeks as part of a staged plan to eventually allow the public back on track.
‘CHURCHES’ REOPEN
More good news for NSW punters with pub and club TABs opening again from Monday.This comes after stand-alone NSW TAB agencies opened their doors last Thursday for the first time in more than eight weeks.
But it’s a very different situation in Victoria with all TAB outlets remaining closed.This means punters cannot have a bet in a pub-TAB in Wodonga but can drive five minutes over the border to bet in Albury. This scene will be duplicated right along the Murray River which divides NSW and Victoria.
In announcing that from Monday, NSW pubs, clubs, cafes and restaurants can have up to 50 customers, Premier Berejiklian said the move was about safely bringing back thousands of jobs in an effort to rebuild their local communities.Victorian publicans do not even have a date as to when they can open their doors again.
LEGEND’S SMALL STEPS TO EVEREST
Classique Legend will be the headline act when he resumes racing in the Listed $150,000 Bob Charley June Stakes (1100m) at Royal Randwick on Saturday.
The Les Bridge-trained Classique Legend hasn’t raced since he finished down the track in the Golden Eagle last November. At his previous start, the hulking grey sprinter ran an unlucky sixth behind Yes Yes Yes in The Everest.
Bridge wants to aim Classique Legend at The Everest later this year – owner Bon Ho is also an Everest slot-holder – and felt the four-year-old needed to have a race preparation given the gelding has not raced for nearly eight months.
Classique Legend won’t lack for opposition in the June Stakes with trainer Brad Widdup considering whether to back up with promising mare Adelong after her tough win at Rosehill last Saturday.
Godolphin’s James Cummings is likely to nominate Viridine and Coruscate, while Hugh Bowman is booked to ride the Kris Lees-trained Tactical Advantage.

HOOPLESS FOR STRADDIE
Victorem is still without a jockey for the Group 1 Stradbroke Handicap at Eagle Farm next Saturday.
Trainer Jenny Graham said she is prepared to wait until after the final Stradbroke field is declared to determine which lightweight jockey is available to ride Victorem at 52.5kg.
Graham’s sprinter is currently on the third line of Stradbroke betting at $8 behind the Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott-trained Dawn Passage at $4.50 favourite and reigning champ Trekking at $5.
Doncaster Mile-winning jockey James Innes Jnr has been booked for the Stradbroke ride on Dawn Passage at 50kg, a massive 7kg less than the sprinter carried to win last Saturday’s Fred Best Classic at Doomben.
Trainers Peter and Paul Snowden have engaged Blake Spriggs to ride last start Gold Coast Guineas winner Hightail.

McDONALD CANTERS TO PREMIERSHIP
With two months of the 2019-20 season remaining, James McDonald is in the box seat to retain the Sydney jockey premiership.
McDonald’s treble at Rosehill last Saturday has taken him to 88.5 wins for the season, opening up a decisive margin on nearest chaser Nash Rawiller (77 wins) for the premiership.
The champion jockey has 18 city meetings remaining to get the 12 winners he needs to smash the 100-win barrier for the second season in succession.
There is no stopping Chris Waller who prepared a brace of Rosehill winners including his Lord Mayors Cup trifecta led home by Wu Gok to take him to 119.5 wins for the season. The Hall of Famer has already secured his 10th successive Sydney trainer premiership.
A STAR RETURNS
Pinatubo, the freakish colt who’s unbeaten six start juvenile campaign last year earned him a higher rating than all-time great Frankel at the same stage of their race careers, resumes in the English 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on Saturday.
Trainer Charlie Appleby said all the indications are Pinatubo has “trained on” since his stunning two-year-old season.
Godolphin’s Pinatubo is prominent in early betting for The TAB Everest but the fact Appleby is racing his sensational colt first up at a mile (a1600m) and has entered him for the English Derby (a2400m) would suggest an Everest spring campaign is looking unlikely.

Connected learning opens doors for regional students and offers more flexibility for students learning at TAFE NSW.
TRADE students from across the state are honing their skills in hairdressing, panel beating, carpentry and more – right from their own backyards and garages.
With COVID-19 restrictions pushing educators to adapt how they deliver their classes – TAFE has put the power in the hands of the students, with an increasing trend of “connected learning”.
And experts say as NSW heads into the recovery phase of the pandemic, learning through webinars, Skype sessions and at home workshops could become the new norm.
TAFE regional general manager Susie George said teachers and students had taken to doing workshops over video conferencing, carrying out practical learning in their garages and learning trade from education videos during the restrictions.
“The COVID pandemic forced us to change and we have to look at things differently. Our teachers uploaded videos of all sorts of different things so people could see step by step different practical activities,” Ms George told The Daily Telegraph.

“We have had students actually request that their classes continue like that. One example is a student in Certificate Four of Construction. Some of those students work for state-based employers who get sent around the state on different infrastructure projects.
“That doesn’t need to mean that they risk their learning for a month. Also, during COVID our more mature cohort had children who were home from school. Online learning gave them the flexibility to be able to balance things on the home front and continue their learning engagement.”
Ms George said for the practical side of learning, students were practising hairdressing skills on at-home models or taking home construction flat packs to assemble in their own garages to be assessed on.
Panel beating teacher Trudy Camilleri said the new changes also opened doors for regional students who could not always attend classes in person.
“It has definitely provided flexibility especially with employers since it gives (students) the opportunity to stay at work and to come online only for a two-hour block,” she said.
“With our students from Canberra, it saves them coming up, we can teach them online until they actually need to come up to Sydney. We have students from the country who do the same thing.”
Panel beating student Radwan Dandan said new modes of learning allowed him to balance his work at a smash repairs business with his studies.
“When I’m at work I can take a couple of hours off and do the class. I work in a family-owned business so taking two or three hours off instead of a whole day was very helpful,” he said.
“I’m lucky since I get to do the more hands on work here (at work). I wouldn’t mind doing online as long as we get the hands-on stuff too.”

Two schools within 2km of each other in Sydney’s east have been forced to close after a student at each tested positive for the coronavirus.
Two Sydney schools have been forced to close after students were diagnosed with coronavirus.
Students at Waverly College in Sydney’s east had to be evacuated this morning before Moriah College, also in the east, had to be closed.
It comes just one day after students across the state returned to classrooms full-time.
Parents were asked to collect their children from Waverly after a Year 7 boy tested positive.
Pictures from the school showed children and parents being escorted away by police officers.
The school texted parents at 9.05am to collect their children from the all-boys school.

“Urgent advice: a member of the Senior Campus has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in isolation,” the text read.
“As a precaution, we ask that you collect your son immediately from Birrell St and Carrington Road gates.
“Health NSW will conduct contact tracing and we undertake a deep clean of the campus.
“We will be in contact with those who have had close contact and will need to isolate.”
About 1100 students attend the Catholic day school for boys from years five to 12.
This all comes after a student tested positive at St Ignatius College, Riverview, last week.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said earlier this month that closing schools temporarily would become common as pupils went back.
Several Sydney schools have shut temporarily after a confirmed COVID-19 case since March, including Epping Boys High School, Normanhurst West Public School, Warragamba Public School and St Mary's Senior High School.
Many students in NSW returned to the classroom yesterday two months after COVID-19 restrictions forced about 800,000 public school children to study remotely.
Some independent and Catholic schools also returned on Monday while others were working towards a June 1 return date.
Waverley College had all of its pupils out in 90 minutes this morning.
Deputy principal Patrick Brennan said they had been preparing for this type of scenario for months.
“We've been in touch with those students and staff members in close contact with the student and are waiting further directions from New South Wales Health. Waverley College has been preparing for COVID-19 for months,” he told reporters.
“And we have the procedures in place to deliver schooling online in the event of an extended closure.
“We got all the boys out in 90 minutes.”
Elizabeth Warren, also a deputy principal at the school, said they couldn't answer any questions about the situation.
Education minister, Sarah Mitchell, has defended sending kids back to school saying the case doesn't mean authorities made the wrong call.
“We know more about the virus now we know the risk at school is very low and we've got those processes in place,” she said.
“We're much better equipped than we were at the end of term 1 and I think that keeping schools open is important, the health advice has always remained that that is something we should be doing and I'm confident that we can keep on this path.”

https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/rural-weekly/cows-in-strong-demand-across-new-south-wales-saleyards/news-story/89578324f3327ced41a5d4f5b52c59c4
HEAVY cattle were in demand at both Central Tablelands Livestock Exchange and Inverell Regional Livestock Exchange last week, with processors dominating the buyers panel and the COVID-19 pandemic creating unexpected market opportunities.
Paul Glyn, Nutrien Ag Solutions, said despite a solid yarding of 1485 head, numbers did not keep up with the strong demand from the processing sector.
“When coronavirus first hit, we thought it would affect the processor market but, even with China slowing down, there have been new markets created, especially with some processors shutting down in the United States,” Mr Glyn said. “Numbers are down for heavier cattle with the change in season and increased feed in paddocks, as producers start to hold on to to cattle for longer which means processors have had to pay higher prices to get the stock they need.”
Ralphs Meat Company and JBS snapped up most of the heavy cattle in the market with the average cow making 296c/kg and the top lot sold by Les McIntyre for 327.2c/kg.
“I think we can expect to see these good prices for a long time, as we won’t see high numbers of heavy cattle back on the market until the crops run out in August or September,” Mr Glyn said.
Lightweight cattle prices remained high and sold to a firm trend with the top pen of steers bought by a restocker from Cowra for 515c/kg, while the average steer made in the region of 400c/kg.
“Restockers are not as dominant right now, with most cattle in good enough condition to go straight to processing,” Mr Glyn said.
Good quality heifers topped at 443.2c/kg for vealer types, and weaner heifers topped the heifer category at 449.2c/kg.
“We are expecting a similar yarding in numbers and quality next week with the market settling as we go into winter,” Mr Glyn said.
Heavy cattle were also in demand further North at IRLX with cows selling 20 to 40c/kg dearer than the previous week.
Will Claridge, C.L. Squires & Co said that there was extra competition from lot feeders and processors for what was a good quality yarding.
“Nationally numbers are low, while we are also seeing increased demand from processors with the USA taking meat at the moment, which has resulted in dearer prices for all finished stock,” Mr Claridge said.
In total 617 head were yarded, and the market was strong across all categories with feeder cattle 10 to 15c/kg dearer.
“Cattle for restockers was limited, but what was in the market fetched a good price,” Mr Claridge said.

Dancing with the Stars judge Sharna Burgess says people should be using dance and yoga to stay fit. Find out her best tips.
Keep positive by exercising your body and mind during the COVID-19 shutdown advises dancer, choreographer and TV star Sharna Burgess. The judge on Channel 10’s Dancing With The Stars has toured the world with Burn The Floor and hosts her own online dance-based fitness program.
Burgess said incorporating a variety of activities such as dance and yoga into a home workout had helped keep her motivated and reduced the risk of boredom.
And she said having a great playlist to work up a sweat to was a sure-fire way to lift your mood.
“There has been such an amazing response online of people sharing workouts and even doing live sessions for anyone to join,” Burgess said.
“Have a look at online classes that your gym may be offering or discover new fun ones to keep you motivated.
“I have my own dance cardio series at www.shop.sharnaburgess.com.”
Burgess said she had adapted her workout in line with the COVID-19 shutdown guidelines and urged people to look at alternatives to their normal routines.
But she said it was important to keep fit, keep moving and keep some consistency in your life despite the coronavirus disruption.
“I personally have been working out at home in the morning when I’d normally go to the gym to keep my routine consistent,” she said.
“I’ve been doing and creating some new dance workouts and also finding fun ones on YouTube to do.
“I am a big lover of yoga for stretching. It’s a beautiful way to start your morning and get the body moving. You can also add in some ballet barre exercises to really work out the body. Many can be found on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube.”
Burgess said while group workouts were off-limits, social media allowed people to workout together in a virtual sense providing much needed community interaction.
“Since social distancing may be the new norm for a while, why not start up an online group with friends or even find a new community that gets together via google chat or any other app that allows multiple user video chats and all work out together,” she said.
The effervescent dancefloor dynamo said maintaining positive outlook was imperative during these uncertain times.
“It’s important to keep focused and know that this is a moment in time,” she said.
“Use this time to appreciate and enjoy being able to read, start an online course, finally write that book or even simply video chat with friends and family as often as you can. We can make this time work for us if we change our perspective on it.”
LFK dance and gym instructor Tori Kovach said that dance was a fun way to keep fit and stay positive while in isolation.
“It’s been so rewarding seeing how happy my usual students are continuing their dancing via Google Meet,” Ms Kovach said.
“Pre-recording videos has also kept up my flexibility and fitness.”
With face-to-face classes at the LFK studio off-limits Ms Kovach has encouraged people to follow dance classes online or connect with family and friends via Zoom and have a dance party. “Like in the physical classes, we’re offering online classes for people in kinder through to mums,” Ms Kovach said.
“We’re using online class delivery platform Verso to offer dance sessions. After each prerecorded session, participants are also welcome to join a weekly Google Meet to dance together and chat.”
Ms Kovach said the 20-minute sessions are an enjoyable and rigorous alternative to other online at home workouts. “It’s a really good form of fitness,” Ms Kovach said. “You can also go at your own pace with the prerecorded sessions. You also don’t need to have participated in previous dance classes to join.”

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/coronavirus-australia-1-in-8-blame-5g-for-spreading-covid19/news-story/750505d135fefedd070b7f4c1757227f
A new poll has revealed how many Aussies think 5G and Bill Gates are behind the COVID-19 pandemic and where they think the virus came from.
Long before COVID-19 spread across the globe, the 5G wireless network was at the heart of conspiracy theories regarding our health.
In January, Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy stressed that the technology was safe and used low-powered radio waves “different to ionising radiation associated with nuclear energy or use in medicine”.
“The radio waves to which the general public is exposed from telecommunications are not hazardous to human health,” he said.
RELATED: Follow the latest coronavirus updates
But a new poll has revealed one in eight Aussies aren’t buying it, instead believing the 5G network is being used to spread COVID-19.
The same number of people (12 per cent) believe the coronavirus is not dangerous and is being used to force people to get vaccines, while 12 per cent think Microsoft founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates “played a role” in its creation and spread.
Gates and his wife have pledged more than $200 million to fight coronavirus but have been popular targets for anti-vaccination voices. He has been portrayed as a profiteer from a virus vaccine while also being blamed at US protests and in the viral “Plandemic” film.
The conspiracy theory figures were revealed in an Essential poll of 1073 Australians, released on Tuesday.
Federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher addressed the “misinformation” on Tuesday.
“Any suggestions that there is a link between 5G and coronavirus are utterly baseless,” he said in a statement.
“As the Chief Medical Officer has said, 5G does not cause the coronavirus and it does not spread coronavirus.”
He labelled the spread of such claims to be irresponsible, dangerous and potentially harmful to the community.
RELATED: Bizarre new $10 note virus theory
Mr Fletcher noted there had been recent arson attacks on mobile phone towers in the UK and New Zealand.
“Interfering or tampering with telecommunications facilities is a criminal offence,” he said.
“Causing damage to mobile phone networks can cut vital connectivity, risking serious harm, even death, if a person is unable to contact triple-0.”
The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency recently addressed concerns from “some members of the public” about the immune system and whether it can be compromised by sources such as 5G.
“The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and the substances they make that helps the human body fight infectious disease caused by invading microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria,” it said in April.
“A number of studies have investigated whether exposure to radio waves can affect the immune system. Some studies have shown that exposure to high power radio waves, much greater than the limits of the ARPANSA safety standard, increases the core body temperature, which can cause temporary effects on the immune system.
“Studies have also investigated whether low level radio wave exposure from telecommunications sources like 5G can impact the immune system.
“Such studies, including those that have investigated effects on antigens, antibodies and oxidative stress, have not provided evidence of changes in immune function.”

In addition to the above theories, the poll found one in five people believe the media and government are exaggerating the COVID-19 death toll “to scare the population”, however 71 per cent dismissed this claim.
Two in five think the virus was engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in the original epicentre Wuhan, which the Prime Minister has repeatedly said there is no evidence to support.
The same number of people, 39 per cent, said they believed this to be false.
“There’s nothing that we have that would indicate that was the likely source,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier this month.
More than three-quarters of respondents (77 per cent) said the outbreak in China was “actually much worse” than reported in official statistics from Beijing.

A restaurant in Sydney has filled its empty tables with cardboard cutouts to make customers feel a little less lonely as a 10-person capacity limit is in place for the premises. Footage taken by Five Dock Dining on May 16 shows the “cardboard customers” having a blast at the restaurant, as they gear up for their third night of keeping diners company during the current restrictions. “It’s all about having a laugh and making the most of our situation,” the restaurant wrote alongside the amusing clip.

Western Australia's streak of no new virus cases ended after a staff member at a hotel where people have been quarantining tested positive.
Western Australia’s streak of no new virus cases has come to an end after a worker at a Perth hotel where returned travellers have been quarantining tested positive to COVID-19 overnight.
Premier Mark McGowan said the case was a 47-year-old man who had been in contact with someone quarantining at the hotel.
“The advice I have is he was working at the Pan Pacific, where as you know, we quarantined a range of people over this period and this gentleman was working there and acquired the illness,” Mr McGowan told reporters this morning.
“He was tested yesterday. There’s currently contact tracing under way. But I think what it shows is it’s extremely contagious and you never know where it’s going to be someone acquiring the illness, which perhaps explains to everyone why we’ve been cautious about what we we’re doing.”
The Premier said West Australians needed to “continue to treat the issue seriously”.

RELATED: When your state will ease restrictions
Eight of the state’s 552 cases remain active, with four people in hospital and one in intensive care.
Health Minister Roger Cook yesterday defended the level of proposed restriction relaxation to come into force from May 18 saying the state was anticipating new community cases of the virus.
“We believe it will be inevitable there will be some new cases out there in the community,” he said.
“With these new cases we stand ready, we stand prepared to respond, we can test, we can trace, we can isolate.”
Phase two of the state’s easing of virus restrictions will begin next week, and will see some regional travel restrictions rolled back, public gatherings of up to 20 people allowed and dine-in meals permitted in venues under strict conditions.
﻿QUEENSLAND
Fewer than 20 active cases of COVID-19 remain in Queensland – who yesterday announced they’d again recorded no new coronavirus infections.
Residents have been urged by the State Government to remain vigilant and get tested if they present with any cold or flu-like symptoms, after they enjoyed a weekend with restrictions further eased and students returned to school yesterday.
Newly appointed Deputy Premier and Health Minister Steven Miles vowed to continue to stamp out coronavirus.
Today Queensland added six new cases to its tally, taking the total to 1051. But none of them were new cases, but people who were diagnosed in other states but are Queensland residents.
“My immediate focus is continuing Queensland’s world-leading response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mr Miles said.
“We moved early and we moved strongly, and we continue to keep in place the steps we put in place to keep Queenslanders safe.”
The continuing low rate of coronavirus cases across the state will likely lead to further restrictions being eased.
Australia has recorded more than 6900 cases to date, with fewer than 770 active cases. The national death toll stands at 97.
VICTORIA
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced 17 new cases of coronavirus in the state.
“There are 1509 cases. That is 17 more than yesterday. The numbers are reconciled by the fact that two positive cases have been reclassified and removed from the list,” Mr Andrews told reporters this morning.
After staying tight-lipped on the matter, the Premier also announced some students in Victoria will return to school in a matter of weeks.
On May 26, classes will resume for prep, Grade 1, Grade 2, Year 11 and Year 12 students.
“This is a staged approach, a staggered approach, both in terms of public health – to limit the number of people that are moving throughout the Victorian community – and also for a whole range of practical reasons, to give schools the appropriate time to move back to face-to-face teaching,” Mr Andrews said.
All Victorian students will be back at school by June 9.
The state has been the last to move on easing restrictions, with Victorians now allowed to have five guests – friends or family – visit their home from 11:59pm tonight until May 31.
Gatherings of 10 people outdoors will also be allowed as long as social distancing is observed.
The Premier’s beloved game of golf, walking groups, fishing and hiking will also be allowed to resume, as will AFL and NRL training, paving the way for both sporting codes to return.
People won’t be allowed to stay at their family and friends’ homes overnight or camp in national parks, some of which are being reopened.
“This is far from over. This is an opportunity for a first step that is safe, cautious and appropriate,” Mr Andrews said.
NEW SOUTH WALES
No new virus cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours in New South Wales for the first time, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced this morning.
Ms Berejiklian urged anyone in the community with even the “mildest symptoms” to come forward and get tested, with the state keen to bump up its level of testing from 6000 tests to 8000.
“As we ease restrictions, there is no doubt the number of cases will increase, and we should measure our success by making sure we have a good level of economic activity and normality in our lives whilst a manageable rate of case numbers,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters this morning.
The staggered approach of returning NSW students to school began yesterday, which she said was a “very smooth” return “by all accounts”.
Over the weekend, the Premier announced that some restrictions would be eased from Friday, May 15.
This includes allowing outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people and the reopening of cafes and restaurants for up to 10 patrons at any one time.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA
South Australia is edging closer to having no active coronavirus cases as it begins to lift restrictions on daily life.
SA Health reported no new infections yesterday with the state’s total remaining on 439. Only one of those is still considered active.
Another person remains in hospital after recovering from the illness but is no longer infectious.
The state has begun lifting virus restrictions with alcohol-free dining allowed in cafes and restaurants provided the number of patrons is limited to 10.
Next month that will be increased to 20 and alcohol will be permitted along with indoor dining, clearing the way for pubs to open their doors again.
Premier Steven Marshall has also suggested the 20-person limit could be increased to ensure the viability of the hospitality sector.
“We’re sitting down with the industry to work out how we might go even more than that when they open because we want to get them back to being viable,” the Premier said.
“But we’ve got to do it in a safe way.
“There will definitely be limits. We’ve got to take this incrementally. We can’t go from zero to 2000.”
TASMANIA
Tasmania has recorded just four new COVID-19 cases this month and no new infections were confirmed today for the fifth day in a row.
Out of the state’s 227 cases, only 27 remain active.
“Tasmanians need to remain vigilant. They need to remain disciplined,” Premier Peter Gutwein told reporters this morning.
“They need to follow the rules. The last thing that we want is a second wave.”
The first stage of a three-step plan out of restrictions is slated to begin on May 18, but the State Government has warned any relaxation of rules depends on public health advice.
“As we go through the recovery phase, increased testing is one of the key pillars,” Health Minister Sarah Courtney told reporters yesterday.
“As we ease restrictions, some people may think that this means the threat has gone away. It has not.”
From next Monday, stage one measures will begin, including allowing gatherings of up to 10 people for indoor and outdoor activities, five visitors allowed in a home, and up to 10 people allowed in restaurants and cafes.
Premier Peter Gutwein has previously said the state will march to its own beat when deciding when to ease restrictions.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/coronavirus-finity-and-unsw-study-finds-areas-most-at-risk-of-virus-outbreak-in-australia/news-story/8d362e8a15032f511787b38a1f6e8ebb
The newly-launched COVID-19 Susceptibility Index has ranked every postcode in Australia for the risk of a virus outbreak.
A firm of Australian actuaries have discovered which Aussie communities will be hit hardest by COVID-19 outbreaks, as restrictions ease across the country.
Australian actuarial and consulting firm Finity, in partnership with the School of Risk and Actuarial Studies at UNSW, launched their publicly available COVID-19 Susceptibility Index on April 22.
The actuaries ranked every postcode in Australia based on the profile of significant comorbidities in the area’s population including age, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and lung disease.
Suburbs have been given a score between 1 and 100; the higher the score, the more vulnerable residents will be to a COVID-19 cluster.
The research found a number of “red zones” across the country that are a cause for concern.

Finity Principal and lead researcher Aaron Cutter believes the Susceptibility Index will help government policy decisions when it comes to kickstarting the economy.
“When a vaccine becomes available, the index could be used to prioritise those more vulnerable communities,” Mr Cutter told news.com.au.
On the flip side, with the index identifying low-risk areas, the government could start easing restrictions in those areas first.
“We want to put as much relevant info in front of the policy makers as we can,” he said.
Mr Cutter confirmed to news.com.au that the Department of Health had reached out to Finity to use their Susceptibility Index.

WHO’S MOST AT RISK?
The index shows overwhelmingly that COVID-19 will “impact unevenly” across different suburbs, according to Mr Cutter.
He was surprised to find “a real divide between rural and metro.”
“The vulnerable population segments are generally situated away from capital cities,” he said.
“While the initial wave of COVID-19 cases was concentrated around capital cities due to population density plus proximity to cruise ships and international airports, these areas consist of lower proportions of highly susceptible individuals compared to the rest of Australia.”
Essentially, more rural areas will be hit harder by a coronavirus second wave.
Older and poorer suburbs will also be more severely affected if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs.
Researchers found a strong link between low Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) scores leading to worse outcomes for coronavirus infections.
THE RED ZONES
The index has identified some of the worst cases in Australia, known as “red zones”.
“In NSW and Victoria, there is a central ‘belt’ where the population is at greater risk,” Mr Cutter said.
He used Kempsey along NSW’s mid-north coast as an example, which has a risk score of 98.
Considering 100 is the maximum risk score, Kempsey’s score is alarmingly high.
“Cardiovascular disease in postcode 2440 (Kempsey) is significantly higher than the general Australian population,” the report found.
“The area also scores poorly for other comorbidities.
“The combined effect indicates that 2440 may have, on average, a much higher risk to severe illness than the general Australian population.”
HOW DOES YOUR AREA RANK?
With Sydney and Melbourne having the highest number of infections in the country, Mr Cutter revealed to news.com.au the 20 most vulnerable suburbs in those areas, according to the Susceptibility Index.
Keep in mind, the higher the score out of 100, the more at risk that area is.

HOW THEY DID IT
A hero effort saw Finity’s Susceptibility Index made in record time, just six weeks.
They used synthesised data that was publicly available, such as from CENSUS and ABS.
“People will be pleased to know there’s no personally identifiable info in any of this work,” Mr Cutter.
“We’re very comfortable representing a postcode, but it doesn't go down to a street level.”
By that, he means that he can’t type in his own name, health conditions, wealth and location and see what his likelihood is of having a severe reaction to COVID-19.
“I don't want the general public to misunderstand the data,” he cautioned.
The actuaries have put in an important disclaimer on their website.
“We note that a postcode with a minimal average risk score does not mean that everyone in the suburb is safe,” the Index says.
“It is likely that even in low average risk suburbs, there are individuals with significant comorbidities who would be at severe risk if they were to contract COVID-19.”
ACTUARIES SAVE THE WORLD
It’s not the first time actuaries have helped in times of national crisis.
Rade Musulin, who is also a Finity actuary part of the research team, helped in the aftermath of the 9/11 Twin Towers terrorist attack and also put his skills to good use after the devastating Hurricane Katrina that tore through New Orleans in 2005.
“This Susceptibility Index is in a way a similar type of exercises we’ve done in terms of terrorism, cyclones, floods,” he told news.com.au.
“We bring in our tools, be that building codes, strengthening against terrorist attacks, or helping us understand COVID-19.”
“There's an expression, it takes a village to do things,” Mr Musulin added.
“It takes a lot of different skill sets (to help during and after a disaster). We possess some of those skills.
“So I wouldn't say we save the world, we’re part of the team that saves the world.”

As the future of live music across the world remains uncertain, one Aussie festival is charging ahead with a few tweaks in an effort boost the local music industry.
The cancellation of tours and music festivals worldwide has been an unfortunate outcome of the coronavirus pandemic – but one Aussie music festival is charging ahead.
Falls Festival, which hosts thousands of New Years’ revellers each year in Lorne, Marion Bay, Byron Bay and Fremantle, announced its plan to go ahead this summer on Wednesday, despite uncertainty hovering over a host of other festivals around the globe.
The news comes two months comes after another iconic Aussie multi-day camping festival, Byron Bay’s Splendour in the Grass, was pushed back from July to October.

Announcing they’re “choosing the bright side”, festival organisers said they will tweak the event to include an all Australian line-up as the future of international travel remains uncertain.
“Getting ready to wave goodbye to 2020 like we are? 2021 we are ready for you!” Falls posted on Instagram.
“We are excited to let you know that we are working towards a limited edition #fallsfestival with an all Australian line-up!”
The post went on to explain how the local focus will help revitalise the struggling music industry, which has been hit hard by COVID-enforced restrictions.
“Bring in the New Year with the very best homegrown talent while also giving back to the Australian music industry who have been doing it tough through this COVID vortex!” the festival’s Instagram account posted.
Falls, which is run by touring company Secret Sounds, said in a statement it was listening to official health advice as it prepared for the December event.
“Health and safety is always our No.1 priority, so as the recovery process begins and more information becomes available, we will continue working with and taking direction from the health authorities,” they added.
The exciting announcement comes days after experts warned music festivals may not be up and running again in Australia until the 2022/2023 summer.
Last Wednesday, Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said he would not consider allowing large-scale gatherings until the nation has a vaccine for the deadly respiratory virus, which could be mid-2021 at the earliest.
Given most large-scale music festivals require months of planning, the timing cast a grim outlook that festival organisers would get approval to host anything during the 2021/2022 season, including Falls.
Haydn Johnston, co-founder of Architects of Entertainment which produces Splendour In The Grass and Lost Paradise, told Triple J’s Hack there was no chance a festival could be pulled together in under six months, given the hoops organisers had to jump through.
But Falls Festival organisers remain “optimistic” the show will go on.
Regular Falls punters will be thrilled by the news, especially after the festival in Lorne was forced to cancel last December as bushfires tore through much of Australia.
The plug was pulled on the festival because of "potential fires, smoke, severe winds and tree hazards", with 9000 disappointed festival-goers having to pack up their tents and leave the site near Lorne on the Great Ocean Road.
Co-producers Jessica Ducrou and Paul Piticco were hopeful the move for this year’s event would give the industry a much-needed boost, and in a statement, promised “some of the most exciting acts in the world” would make up the line-up.
“This special ‘home grown’ edition of Falls will ensure that money stays in our local economy, providing maximum financial benefit for the Australian music community – artists, management, crew, agents, roadies, production etc – as well as the thousands of contractors and suppliers who rely on our events for their income,” they said.
Official dates for the December 2020/January 2021 event are yet to be announced.

Demonstrators were forced to use exercise as a means of protest amid the COVID-19 pandemic on May 4, when New South Wales South Coast residents campaigned against the clearing of forest that had been spared from the catastrophic 2019-2020 bushfires. Developer Ozy Homes planned to develop a 20-hectare area at Manyana after receiving approval for the project in 2008, according to reports. However, locals were concerned that the development land had become a last refuge for local wildlife that had lost its habitat during the bushfires. Social distancing regulations in place across New South Wales to stem the spread of coronavirus had effectively banned mass protests, forcing the demonstrators to use exercise – such as yoga and walking – as a reason to attend the site. An estimated 312 homes were destroyed and 500,000 hectares were burnt in the surrounding area by the 74-day Currowan fire in late 2019 and early 2020. The blaze threatened homes and forced resident to evacuate to beaches in the area on New Year’s Eve. Record bushfires gripped much of New South Wales in late 2019 and early 2020, with over 11,400 bush and grass fires burning 5.5 million hectares, the equivalent of 6.2 percent of the state of New South Wales. Fires burned across the state for 240 consecutive days between July 2019 and March 2020. Credit: Manyana Matters via Storyful

There’s cause for cautious celebration in the state at the epicentre of Australia’s coronavirus crisis, with one key number showing how it’s turned the corner.
It has been at the epicentre of Australia’s coronavirus outbreak crisis, recording a mammoth number of cases and two deadly cluster sites in aged care facilities.
But New South Wales looks to have turned the corner and authorities are cautiously optimistic that they’re now on top of the pandemic.
There’s one key number that illustrates the success of the state’s current position, as it prepares for an easing of strict social distancing restrictions in coming weeks as well as the resumption of schooling.
Chief medical officer Nicole Chant today said there had been a total of 3535 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NSW since the outbreak began.
But the number of active cases is extremely low.
“There are currently 102 COVID cases being treated by NSW Health, including 13 people in intensive care units with those 11 on ventilators,” Dr Chant said.
“And three quarters of the cases have been managed in out of hospital care settings.”
RELATED: Follow the latest coronavirus updates
At a media briefing this morning, Premier Gladys Berejiklian was upbeat as she confirmed another day of positive data with just three new infections.
“The numbers are continuing to be just a handful, which is a positive sign,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“We had about 5200 people tested in the last batch, and this refers to the last cohort tested over the weekend.”
Health authorities are preparing to dramatically ramp up that testing rate, aiming to achieve 8000 tests this weekend.
That rigorous testing will be crucial to detect any new outbreaks and manage them to prevent further spread, Ms Berejiklian said.
“As we're lifting restrictions in May and looking forward to lifting more restrictions than the ones announced, we need to make sure more people are getting tested so we can control the virus and the spread, and ensure the vast majority of the community stay away from the virus.”
RELATED:  How are you coping during the pandemic? Take our survey
There will likely be further outbreaks as restrictions are eased and people begin returning to work, she warned.
“We made sure we up scaled the health system to cater with cases, especially as we go through the winter month … we know with greater activity there is the likelihood of more cases which is fine so long as you can manage them.”
Dr Chant said anyone with even the mildest of symptoms should come forward for testing as soon as possible.
“It's essential that everyone in the community has the lowest threshold for testing,” she said.
“Symptoms such as fatigue, chills, muscle aches, the mildest runny nose, any cough, loss of smell or taste, that broad range of symptoms, please come forward to testing, it is essential to have high rates of testing.”
Dr Chant called out residents in the hard-hit areas of Blacktown and Canada Bay in the west to come forward.
“It is essentially before we ease restrictions we ascertain and detect any cases of COVID-19 in the community.”

NSW continues to flatten the curve with just five new COVID-19 cases reported in 24 hours from 8800 tests. It comes as NSW deploys rapid testing kits, allowing high-risk patients to get test results in an hour.
In a heartening sign NSW continues to flatten the curve, just five new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the past 24 hours out of 8809 tests.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said it was the second highest rate of testing recorded across NSW since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. There were no new deaths.
The highest day — March 27 — saw 8835 tests completed but a massive 212 positive cases.
“We have seen a 40-times better outcome for our community since the end of March,” Mr Hazzard said.
Of the five new cases, two were staff members at the virus-plagued Newmarch aged care facility, two were from unknown sources and one is still under investigation.
Of the 209 people being treated by NSW Health, about 75 per cent in out-of-hospital care. Fourteen were in intensive care and 12 of those required ventilators.
It was also announced that NSW had secured more US-manufactured rapid testing kits.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits had been in use in priority regional areas where clusters of concern were identified and will now be rolled out to 29 additional labs.
The tests allow high risk patients to receive their COVID-19 test results within an hour, instead of 24- 48 hours.
“The faster we can isolate higher risk patients and quarantine their contacts, the less likely they can unknowingly spread it to others,” Mr Hazzard said.
“On average, test results are being processed in less than 48 hours from the far corners of this vast state which is an achievement in itself, given the issues with flights and logistics.
“Now we will have even more vital hours up our sleeve, which will allow us to speed up our contract tracing efforts to map and isolate known contacts of cases.”
MASS TESTING CRITICAL TO SLOW VIRUS
Chief Medical Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the challenge for NSW was to maintain high testing rates in order to identify potential clusters early.
NSW has among the highest testing rates in Australia and the world, with 235,894 people tested across the state — 232,863 of which were negative.
The new, rapid PCR testing kits currently in use in NSW Health Pathology laboratories in Broken Hill, Wagga Wagga, Orange, Coffs Harbour and Tamworth, will begin being used in and 29 more labs across the state from next week.
The technology used for the rapid testing kit is already in use for the testing of influenza and other respiratory viruses.
NEWMARCH INFECTIONS INVESTIGATED
Possible breaches of infection control at Newmarch ages care facility are being investigated by NSW Health after two more staff members tested positive for COVID-19 overnight.
There have been 61 cases at the nursing home near Penrith since the outbreak on April 11.
NSW health has deployed two infection control nurses to the facility to review its procedures.
“We’ve clearly seen transmission that on the surface looks like there’s been breaches in infection control among particularly the staff,” NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant said.
“And that’s obviously a concern. There have been some elements where consistent application of infection control practice has not occurred.”

Anglicare Sydney said in a statement on Saturday it was investigating the two new cases after three residents also tested positive on Thursday.
“Additional positive cases associated with Newmarch House are very distressing for our staff, our residents, and their families.”
The facility, which has been criticised by residents’ relatives for a lack of communication, has started window visits with residents so they can talk with visitors.
“We are further improving our pastoral care for residents and their families by offering access to Anglicare Sydney’s counselling and chaplaincy services as well as continuing the successful window visits between residents and families,” Anglicare Sydney said in the statement.
PREMIER URGES WEEKEND VIRUS TESTING
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has urged people with even the mildest symptoms to come forward for COVID-19 testing this weekend when testing number usually drop.
It comes as restrictions eased in the state, allowing up to two adults and their dependent children to visit another household anywhere across the state.
Mr Hazzard said today he had also eased restrictions on people attending beauty salons to buy vouchers or other products.
NSW COULD ABOLISH STAMP DUTY
NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet reportedly wants to abolish stamp duty and possibly payroll tax to help the state’s economy recover from coronavirus.
Mr Perrottet says scrapping inefficient taxes are part of his plan to restart a state economy facing 10 per cent unemployment by the end of 2020.
The treasurer has also foreshadowed a big fall in state budget revenue in 2021, but maintained he would prioritising the economy over NSW’s finances.

Two spitters and a woman fined three times are among the newest penalty infringement notices dished out by police in the last 24 hours.
Police were forced to chase after a man across several Central Coast suburbs on Thursday after reports the man spit on and harassed a woman.
The 34-year-old man was approached by security staff in a Tuggerah shopping centre. Before police arrived, the man allegedly ran away, boarding a train at Gosford and finally being arrested by police at Woy Woy train station.
The man was charged with a slew of offences including shoplifting, assault and for spitting under the public health order.
In a separate incident on Thursday a police officer was allegedly spat on by a woman when they approached her unit in Wentworthville.
Police were there to speak to the 49-year-old woman about medical treatment when she became aggressive, yelling at officers and assaulting them.
She was also charged with spitting under the public health order and assaulting an officer.
Just after 6pm on Thursday police split up an illegal gathering in a car park in Mt Druitt.
Four people were found not to have a reasonable excuse for meeting together and three were issued warning and told to move on.
The fourth, a 22-year-old woman, was found to have already received three $1000 fines for not obeying the public health order.
She was charged with not complying with the public health order and will face court later this year.
21 people were charged or fined in the 24 hour period.
PREMIER URGES TESTING FOR MILD SYMPTOMS
NSW has recorded nine new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours after more than 7000 people were tested.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said half the new cases were from community to community transmission and urged people to be vigilant, especially as self isolation restrictions begin easing from today.
“Please come forward even if you have the mildest symptoms,” she said in Sydney.
“You don’t need to wait until Monday. You could be unintentionally passing on the disease without knowing you have it.”
The changes to restrictions from Friday allow up to two adults and their dependent children to visit another household anywhere across the state.
Meanwhile, Anglicare’s Newmarch House recorded its 13th death among residents yesterday.
And five ADF personnel who contracted COVID-19 while on tours of duty in the Middle East have been flown home to Australia.
13th NEWMARCH DEATH RECORDED
Another resident of the Newmarch aged care home in Western Sydney has died after contracting coronavirus, the facility’s thirteenth COVID-19 related death.
Anglicare Sydney has released a statement saying it was deeply saddened by the death on Thursday afternoon of a 74-year-old man, and extended its deepest sympathies to the family. It is NSW’s 43rd coronavirus death, taking the national toll to 92.
“The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on all our residents and families as well as our staff over the last three weeks”, the statement said.
On Thursday, another three Newmarch residents were identified as positive for coronavirus.
A total of 34 residents and 22 staff members at the home have tested positive to the coronavirus.
Anglicare said the latest cases came despite “having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place”.
“These new cases may reflect historical transmissions and reflect the rigorous and ongoing testing at Newmarch House.
“We will be investigating further how this has occurred.”
The statement also said the home has been able to turn more attention to communicating with families, and window-visits were proving successful.
NSW Chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said it was possible the infection was spreading through staff after maintaining it was unlikely residents were contracting the illness from one another.
“We are having another infection control review. Those patients were picked up as part of the screening program so they had very minimal or no symptoms,” she said.
“It’s a question of whether it’s the staff that has infected the patient or whether there is something else. It’s always important to go into investigations with an open mind so you don’t miss anything.
“We will continue to support Newmarch House with expert infection control advise.”
All tests conducted on staff and patients at the Bondington aged care facility have returned negative and the total number of cases remains at one.
“A third and final round of testing will commence today,” she said.
ADF OFFICERS CATCH VIRUS IN MIDDLE EAST
Five defence force officers who contracted coronavirus in the Middle East have been flown home to Australia.
Personnel serving in the region were tested after a number of local contractors became infected with the virus.
The five Australians are all asymptomatic.
Four returned to Australia on Friday morning on a routine defence force flight and were taken to Royal Darwin Hospital for assessment.
The fifth, who recently completed their deployment, previously returned to Australia and is currently in mandatory quarantine in Brisbane.
The Australian Defence Force says it decided to test personnel “after being notified that a number of locally engaged contractors had tested positive”. It did not say exactly where the officers became infected.
“Defence will take all necessary measures in consultation with our Coalition partners, relevant host nations and Australian federal, state and territory governments to ensure ADF personnel receive the treatment and care required,” it said in a statement on Friday.
BUSINESS BOOSTER
More than 1800 businesses have joined the state government’s fight against COVID-19 by supplying critical personal protective equipment like gloves, gowns and masks.
The government announced it has engaged with more than 1600 local businesses already and ordered face masks, sanitisers, disinfectants, gloves, surgical gowns and paper products.
About 20 per cent of the businesses who have registered on the government’s Emergency Supplies portal are from regional NSW.
“We know businesses in regional NSW are struggling, having dealt with drought, bushfires and now COVID-19,” Deputy premier John Barilaro said.
“However, people in the bush are resilient and resourceful and that’s never been more evident than now as companies re-purpose their product line to provide medical and cleaning products, to help during the COVID-19 crisis.”
Jobs and Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres said the eligibility of suppliers was decided per the Therapeutic Goods Administration standards.
“Over a 100 business have qualified. We have been able to put a number of businesses in contracted positions,” Mr Ayres said.
“I’m very confident that the PPE arrangements that we have across our medical system in the medium term are well supported.”

When COVID-19 struck, this country did the opposite of all others – it didn’t shut down anything. Thousands have died but some still hail it as a success.
They’re images that seem alien these days – people dining out at restaurants, lazing in parks surrounded by others, going to work and dropping their kids at school, or chatting in shops.
Since the coronavirus pandemic forced almost every country on the planet to bring a rapid end to many elements of everyday life, these kinds of once-normal activities have been largely impossible.
But one nation remains the stark outlier, adopting a unique and controversial approach to dealing with the public health crisis.
It hasn’t banned anything. Instead, Sweden is simply asking citizens to be responsible and safe, and is counting on them to do the right thing.
Apart from encouraging people to keep two metres away from others and work from home if possible, it’s business as usual in the European nation.
RELATED:  Follow the latest coronavirus updates
As of Thursday, Sweden has 20,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus and the death toll stands at 2462, with a high infection mortality rate of about 12 per cent.
Despite that heavy loss, significantly higher than its Scandinavian neighbours, some are heralding the approach as something of a success – and a potential road map for the rest of the world.
GOING IT ALONE
As the rest of Europe – and indeed the world – began locking down as coronavirus spread in February and March, Sweden’s health authorities decided on a vastly different approach.
Its neighbours watched on in horror and surprise.
Across the border in Finland, the government declared a state of emergency in mid-March, shutting down schools and ordering the closure of restaurants, bars and cafes.
It was a few days after Denmark made a similar decision, closing its borders and instituting a number of bans on socialisation.
At the same time, Norway closed its schools, childcare centres and universities and told businesses where people were in close proximity, like hairdressers and cafes, to shut.
RELATED:  When will lockdowns end in my state?
Defending Sweden’s approach, chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell earlier this month said a lockdown like that was viewed as unsustainable.
“Locking people up at home won't work in the longer term,” Dr Tegnell said. “Sooner or later people are going to go out anyway.”
In an interview with The Times, he repeated his belief that a short and sharp lockdown would only delay the inevitable – a high number of cases and potentially a high number of deaths.
“Even the most optimistic people seem to say that if we have a vaccine available in the next 18 months we are going to be very lucky,” he told the newspaper
“To keep schools closed until we have a vaccine in place, I would say that will not be possible because then you are going to see a big damage to a cohort of children in your country.”
Sweden’s approach hasn’t been without controversy and fierce debate. Far from it.
In late March, some 2000 researchers from around the country signed a petition demanding the government “immediately take steps to comply with the World Health Organisation’s recommendations”.
“The measures should aim to severely limit contact between people in society and to greatly increase the capacity to test people for COVID-19 infection,” the group wrote.
A group of 22 professors also wrote an article raising serious concerns about the strategy and warning it could lead to preventable deaths and chronic lung illnesses.
Anders Vahlne, a professor in clinical virology, is worried that Swedes don’t appreciate how infectious coronavirus is and that it can spread via asymptomatic people.
“Even if you don’t sneeze or cough, you still breathe,” he told EuroNews.
“All data indicate that this virus spreads through the inhaling of aerosol particles, which stay infectious in the air for more than 16 hours.”
In contrast to those experts, it seems Swedes themselves are comfortable, with the ruling Social Democratic Party seeing its opinion poll results rise for the second month in a row. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven’s handling of the pandemic is attributed with growing support for the government.
Dr Tegnell believes it’s only a matter of time before other nations that reacted swiftly and strongly, essentially bringing an end to normal life and halting their economies, will have to backtrack.
And it’s at that stage when Sweden could shine a light on a possible path forward.
THE ‘H’ WORD
Sweden’s model of dealing with coronavirus can be simply described as planning and hoping for herd immunity.
Herd immunity should theoretically occur when a significant proportion of the population has contracted COVID-19 and recovered from it, therefore unable to get it again, if that indeed is possible.
The science isn’t yet settled, but Dr Tegnell is hopeful.
“I think that is the only thing that is going to slow this down when we have a considerable proportion of the population in most countries who are immune to the disease, because these diseases are not stopped by anything else really if you don’t have a vaccine.”
Paul Franks, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Lund University, is one of those who believe Sweden could provide a guide for the rest of the world in the coming phases of the epidemic.
Until there’s a vaccine, there will inevitably be new waves of coronavirus outbreaks – unless enough people have been infected to achieve herd immunity, Professor Franks said.
But that assumes those who have already contracted COVID-19 retain enough antibodies to protect them, and that the virus doesn’t mutate into a distinct new strain.
In any case, herd immunity would require about 60 per cent of a population to be infected and recover, according to estimates, Prof Franks said.
“Sweden, which is encouraging social distancing but has not fully locked down, could guide the world,” Prof Franks wrote in The Conversation. “Here, the authorities claim the country is rapidly approaching herd immunity (levels).”
That looming milestone won’t come without significant cost.
Sweden’s mortality rate is in the 10 highest in the world and significantly greater than its neighbours Norway, Denmark and Finland.
“The high mortality rate in Sweden we can see is very closely linked to our elderly homes in Sweden,” Dr Tegnell said.
“That has happened far less in Norway and Finland.
“We have looked at the death rates very closely and we are trying to work out why because there was already a ban on visiting care homes.
“But in the homes in Sweden they are really old and really sick and need constant care. They need people coming there and the lockdown can’t stop that.”
It could be that achieving herd immunity and getting coronavirus under control in Sweden is at the expense of the deaths of those most vulnerable in the community.
Professor Marylouise McLaws, an epidemiologist with the Healthcare Infection and Infectious Diseases Control unit at UNSW, said the herd immunity approach came at a “high price”.
“Sweden has unfortunately chosen ‘herd immunity’ at a high price, with 2500 deaths and a very large number of active cases who, without stringent quarantine of cases and contacts, have the potential to continue rather than flatten the curve,” Professor McLaws told news.com.au.
“Of great concern is the future impact for our ability as a global neighbourhood to open our borders with a ‘herd immunity’ approach that fuels the pandemic and may potentially causes a boomerang of seasonality around the world.”

MILESTONE IMMINENT
This week, Sweden’s Public Health Agency forecast that one-third of people in the capital of Stockholm will have been infected by coronavirus by early next month.
That’s the equivalent of 200,000 people and significantly higher than the official number of cases confirmed across the whole country.
It’s because the agency believes there are some 75 unconfirmed cases for every confirmed case.
And it’s confident the peak of infection has passed.
“We believe we passed the peak of the transmission a week ago,” Dr Tegnell told the BBC. “It will definitely affect the reproduction rate and slow down the spread.”
There are some early signs that he could be right.
A study from New Zealand researchers this week examined the reproduction rates in several countries and compared it to their individual pandemic response plans.
Hassan Vally, an associate professor at La Trobe University, examined the research and said Sweden’s Reff – or effective reproduction rate of infection – has dipped below one.
“A Reff of less than one means each infected person spreads the virus to less than one other person, on average,” Associate Professor Vally explained.
“By keeping Reff below one, the number of new infections will fall and the virus will ultimately disappear from the community.”
Sweden’s “markedly relaxed” approach has been contentious, he said, and the number of cases and deaths there is much higher than elsewhere in Scandinavia.
“But Reff indicates that the curve is flattening.”
SHOULD OTHERS FOLLOW SUIT?
Prof Franks said Sweden’s modelling provided reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the coming weeks and months.
“If the simulations conducted in Sweden are correct, and post-infection immunity is achieved in most people, we should soon expect infections and deaths in Stockholm to drop substantially in the coming weeks,” Prof Franks said.
But Erik Wengström, a professor of economics at Lund University, isn’t convinced such an approach would work everywhere for one big reason – trust.
Put simply, the level of trust people have in government, politicians, agencies and their fellow citizens is extremely high in Sweden.
“Since Sweden has among the highest levels of trust in the world, the strong relationship between trust and approval of the strategy might suggest its approach would be less successful elsewhere,” Prof Wengström wrote in an article for The Conversation.
“There is a clear risk that in countries characterised by lower levels of trust, the perception of a more voluntary-based approach will be less favourable.
“In addition, a crucial part of Sweden’s policy is to get people to voluntarily follow recommendations from authorities. And if people do not trust others to comply, they are less likely to comply themselves.”
More than trust, Prof McLaws described Sweden’s approach to controlling coronavirus as “unsuccessful”.
“To date Sweden’s approach has resulted in over 20,000 cases, of whom 83 per cent are still active cases who have the capacity to contribute to the transmission of further cases. 479 cases are serious or critical and nearly 2500 deaths have been reported.
“I would described their approach to control as unsuccessful.
“Their curve suggests they have several waves or surges in cases. For anyone to describe their epidemic curve as showing early signs of flattening is an optimistic interpretation.”
And Associate Professor Vally said the New Zealand research showed that, Sweden aside, one approach overwhelmingly seemed to be the most successful.
“Individually, (the country’s results) each tell their own story. Together, they have one clear message: places that moved quickly to implement strict interventions brought the coronavirus under control much more effectively, with less death and disease.
“And our final example, Singapore, adds an important coda – the situation can change rapidly, and there is no room for complacency.”

New South Wales has confirmed just two new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours ahead of easing restrictions on Friday. 

Restrictions will be eased to allow two adults to visit others in their home but Premier Berejiklian has urged people to use their new freedom “responsibly”. 

“We appreciate that for mental health and to reduce isolation, people are now allowed to go and visit others in their home, two adults at a time. Please make sure you do this responsibly,” she said.

A serving police officer and her boyfriend are facing hefty fines after allegedly breaching coronavirus rules twice.
A West Australian police officer and her boyfriend will face court after allegedly breaching coronavirus border restrictions twice.
Police allege the 29-year-old police officer – a serving constable – was charged along with her 24-year-old boyfriend after they allegedly breached regional travel restrictions by trying to travel to Perth from the Wheatbelt region without a lawful exemption.
“It is alleged, on both occasions the man driving the vehicle was advised by police he was not an exempted traveller and was given a direction to turn around,” WA Police said.
“It is further alleged the man failed to comply with this direction and immediately continued beyond the police checkpoint.”

Dozens of people ignored high fences and social distancing rules on the weekend, flocking to a Sydney beach to soak up some sun.
A metres-high metal fence and COVID-19 social-distancing restrictions didn’t stop dozens of Sydneysiders bathing in the sunlight in the eastern suburbs on the weekend.
People were scattered among the rocks at Mackenzies Bay on Anzac Day, with many stopping to sit or sunbake in their boardshorts and bikinis despite local and state government advice.
RELATED: Follow the latest coronavirus updates
The bay is a small inlet between Bondi Beach and Tamarama Beach, which both remain closed to all land-based activities including social gatherings, sunbaking, walking and jogging.
In NSW, residents are allowed to leave home to exercise but “must not participate in a gathering in a public place of more than two persons”. Members of the same household are an exception to this rule.
Failure to comply with a direction under the Public Health Order carries a maximum penalty of six months behind bars or a fine of up to $11,000.
BEACHES TO REOPEN UNDER STRICT NEW MEASURES
Bondi Beach and Bronte Beach will partially reopen tomorrow for local surfers and experienced swimmers to exercise from Monday to Friday, according to the local council.
Waverley Mayor Paula Masselos said access to the water will be via designated entry and exit points managed by rangers.
“The council expects to provide access to the water for the sole purpose of exercising for surfers and swimmers between the hours of 7am and 5pm on weekdays commencing Tuesday 28 April,” a statement from Waverley Council reads.
“The council will review these measures on an ongoing basis, including whether to provide access on weekends.”
In addition, surfing will be permitted at Tamarama and Mackenzies Bay between the same designated hours “but the beach remains closed to swimmers and all land-based activity”, Waverley Council states.
The council said, as per public health orders, all public ocean pools including Bronte Pool remain closed.
Ms Masselos said the strict “Swim & Go” and “Surf & Go” measures had the support of NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard and NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant.
Not long now Bronte. 7.00 am Tuesday 28 April swimmers and surfers will be able to safely access the water via designated corridors. Beach remains closed. Please observe rules and social distancing as I really want this to work. Otherwise reclosure. pic.twitter.com/TMqJlj0OFJ
She stressed that it was not a “reopening” of Waverley’s beaches.
“There will be no relaxing or gathering around on the sand. The sand remains strictly off-limits other than for access to the water for exercising. If social distancing rules can’t be followed, then this access to the water will be shut down,” Ms Masselos said.
“I also want to remind people that the NSW public health order to stay at home remains in effect. These measures are strictly for locals to exercise locally, and if you are attending the beach to exercise, please do your exercise and leave.
“The timing of our measures coincides with the onset of cooler weather and the opportunity to monitor what is happening in other council areas with regard to their beaches.”
She said if the conditions or instructions from rangers were not adhered to, Waverley Council would have “no choice” but to ban all access to the water.
“Remember, these measures are not designed for people to have a dip or paddle or for children to play on the sand,” Ms Masselos said.
‘ACCESSIBLE FOR EXERCISE’
The move follows measures introduced further south in the Randwick Council enclave that got off to a rough start last week when they were ignored.
Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly beaches closed on Friday afternoon after people “failed” to acknowledge the rules, Randwick Council said. They were hit by crowds again over the weekend.
We had to close Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly beaches today due to crowds and non-compliance with the exercise requirements.Weâll open them 6am to 9am only on Saturday and Sunday for exercise. Please stay safe and stay home. If exercising, please do so locally. pic.twitter.com/srycWUL3py
The situation has been reassessed and they opened on Monday from 6am to 9am for swimming, surfing and jogging.
“Leave once you’ve finished exercising,” the council says.
All other unpatrolled beaches in Randwick City remain closed until further notice including Gordon’s Bay, Malabar Beach, Little Bay Beach, Frenchmans Beach, Yarra Bay and Congwong Beach, as do ocean rock pools.
Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly Beaches will be accessible for exercise tomorrow (Mon) from 6-9am. That means swimming, surfing and jogging. ðââï¸ ðââï¸ ðââï¸ Please practise social distancing and leave once youâve finished exercising.

The coronavirus pandemic has passed a grim new milestone, with more than 200,000 people worldwide now dead from the virus.
The coronavirus pandemic has passed a grim new milestone, with more than 200,000 people worldwide now dead from the virus.
There are more than 2.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to John Hopkins University figures.
It comes after the number of fatalities in the US passed 50,000, with Americans enduring the world’s deadliest outbreak.
Five countries, including the UK, Italy, Spain, France and the US, have reported death tolls above 20,000, although the true figure is estimated to be higher.
It comes as the World Health Organisation warns patients who have recovered from the virus may not be protected against reinfection.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while most of the epidemics in Western Europe appeared to be stabilising, for many countries the disease was just getting started.
"And some (countries) that were affected early in the pandemic are now starting to see a resurgence in cases," he said.
Singapore, for example, has seen a renewed surge in infections despite winning initial praise for its success in containing the virus.

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo says he will authorise independent pharmacies to carry out tests for COVID-19. He said he would also expand screening for antibodies at four hospitals, starting with essential workers. The state of New York alone has recorded more than 16,000 deaths.
Australia's death toll reached 81 on Saturday with the deaths of two people — one in Tasmania and another in Sydney's west.
The latest victim in Tasmania is a 90-year-old man who died at the Mersey Community Hospital in Latrobe.
Nine of Tasmania’s deaths have been in the northwest, where an outbreak has been responsible for the majority of the island’s 208 cases.
Twelve new cases confirmed in NSW include a worker at a Blue Mountains aged care home, prompting concerns of another outbreak.
Australia's total confirmed cases now stands at 6694, a relatively modest increase on 6565 a week ago.
At the peak of the crisis at the end of March, cases were rising by more than 200 a day.
COUNTRIES PIN HOPES ON ANTIBODY TESTS
Many governments have rushed to buy millions of antibody tests as they plan their virus exit strategy.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the tests a “game changer” and ordered 3.5 million home tests from various Chinese companies.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also announced a massive rollout of antibody testing in his virus-ravaged state this week.
But Australia’s Health Department last month said “point of care” tests that detected antibodies were yet to be rigorously tested by the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA).
“Many countries are now testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the population level or in specific groups, such as health workers, close contacts of known cases, or within households,” the WHO said.
“WHO supports these studies, as they are critical for understanding the extent of – and risk factors associated with – infection.
“These studies will provide data on the percentage of people with detectable COVID-19 antibodies, but most are not designed to determine whether those people are immune to secondary infections.”
The head of the WHO’s emergencies program, Dr Mike Ryan, has previously said there is “lots of uncertainty” surrounding antibody tests.

A handful of US states are reopening for business despite fears of a “second wave” of COVID-19 as death toll hits terrifying new mark.
Donald Trump suggests new ways to fight coronavirusChina puts city of 10 million ‘into lockdown’New Aussie guidelines for exercise, schools, aged care comingUK bank warns of ‘worst recession’ in centuries
The US passed a dreaded new COVID-19 death tally of 50,000 as some states took small steps to re-open for business despite warnings of a “second wave” of the virus hitting America.
It comes as US intelligence officials probe the possibility that America’s enemies might use the coronavirus as a bioweapon, according to an alarming report.
The Department of Defense is monitoring for the potential of the virus to be weaponised, possibly against prominent, high-level targets, sources told Politico.
A Pentagon spokesman said its Chemical and Biological Defense program continues to support federal coronavirus countermeasures such as testing, vaccines and screening machines.
Andy Weber, who served as assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense program under President Barack Obama, said the virus could be easily spread by US enemies or terrorists using a simple spray bottle.
“In its natural state, the current virus could be used as a bioweapon by less sophisticated groups,” Mr Weber said. “Or, for a nation-state with a more advanced biological weapons program, this virus could be given enhanced characteristics.”
Meanwhile, some businesses took the first steps toward reopening in the US state of Georgia Friday as the Republican governor eased a month-long shutdown amid experts’ warnings of a potential new surge in coronavirus infections.
GETTING BACK TO WORK AMID FEARS OF ‘SECOND WAVE’
Businesses in a number of US states re-opened their doors following similar moves in some European countries.
Hairdressers, massage clinics, nail salons, bowling alleys, tattoo parlours and gyms were among businesses given the green light to get back to work, although reports indicated business was light. Some business owners said the lack of demand made it unviable to reopen.
It has been a similar story in Germany where some business lockdown measures were eased this week.
Germany allowed smaller retailers of under 800 square meters to re-open, as long as they abided by social distancing and hygiene measures.
Larger businesses, such as car dealerships, bike and book shops were also allowed to re-open as well as Ikea.
Stefan Stukenborg, head of an Ikea branch on the outskirts of Cologne, said his store’s re-opening “was very relaxed, there were no lines, there were no crowds.”
Stefan Genth, CEO of the German retail federation Handelverband Deutschland, suggested this was likely to be the case for some time as consumer sentiment was at an “all-time low,” partly becuase people were worried about keeping their jobs.
Italy, which has been the epicentre of Europe’s pandemic, also allowed some of its smaller retailers to re-open this week but store owners said they didn’t expect business to be same as before Covid-19.
Authorities in Germany and other nations have warned of the danger of reopening “too early” and possibly sparking a second wave of infections.
Authorities are worried that a second wave of Covid-19 infections could be dangerous, making people sick “everywhere at the same time”, virologist Christian Drosten of Berlin’s Charite hospital said.
He warned of complacency, saying Germany could be in the middle of potentially “squandering” the head start it had established.
Prominent New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also spoke of fears of “second wave” if US states and countries around the world re-opened prematurely.
“The game isn’t over, it’s only half time,” he said after reporting improving infection rates and death tolls for his state.
“If we are premature, all the progress we made is gone. Virtually all the experts say not only will the virus increase, but it will reach a higher point than we reached the first time.
“I know everyone is impatient, everyone wants to re-open, but that is what will happen.”
NOW EXPERTS SAY STAYING AT HOME COULD KEEP VIRUS THREAT ALIVE
In Italy, where the strict stay at home order has been credited with finally getting that nation’s crisis under some semblance of control, authorities are now warning that home has become a dangerous place for many Italians.
Italian households represent “the biggest reservoir of infections,” said Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious diseases department at Luigi Sacco University Hospital in Milan. He called the cases “the possible restarting point of the epidemic in case of a reopening”.
The family acts as a multiplier, said Andrea Crisanti, the top scientific consultant on the virus in the Veneto region.
“This is a ticking time bomb,” he told the New York Times.
The predicament of home infections is emerging not just in Italy but in hot spots like the suburbs of New York and Paris and areas of Rome and Milan.
Local officials and epidemiologists say the problem is getting too little attention, particularly as the government has announced tentative steps toward reopening in early May.
Italy’s leading virologists now consider home infections, alongside clusters in retirement homes, to be a major source of the country’s contagion.
Living together in close quarters and the failure to move the infected into dedicated quarantine facilities have propped up the curve of infections that “stay home” measures were designed to suppress.
The Chinese government dealt with this problem by rounding up all residents in Wuhan infected with the coronavirus and isolating them in quarantine camps. It is an approach that the would prove far harder to implement in western countries that place higher value on individual liberty.
CUOMO BACKS TRUMP ON WHO CRITICISM
As media critical of the US President had a field day lashing him for what he said was a “sarcastic” remark to explore the possibility of injecting disinfectant into people sick with COVID-19, he recieved support from a surprise source.
Leading Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo said he backed Mr Trump’s view that the World Health Organisation had to be questioned about its response to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Cuomo said it was plain to see that the US - especially New York - had been left exposed to infection from millions of travellers from Europe and Asia earlier this year - unaware of the seriousness of the situation.
“Whose job is it to warn us of these global pandemics?” Mr Cuomo said.
“The President says it’s the World Health Organisation and that’s why he’s taken action against them.
“Not my field but he’s right to ask the question because this was too little too late and let’s find out what happened so it doesn’t happen again.”
Meanwhile, some businesses took the first steps toward reopening in the US state of Georgia Friday as the Republican governor eased a month-long shutdown amid experts’ warnings of a potential new surge in coronavirus infections.
In Atlanta, a TV reporter tweeted a photo of a man getting a haircut - he was among the first customers at a barber shop that was reopening. The barber was wearing a mask, but no gloves or other PPE.
A bowling alley in Rome, Georgia, posted on Facebook that it was getting back in business with social distancing rules, including a limit of six people to a lane and plenty of hand sanitizer.
With deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to remain closed in spite of Governor Brian Kemp’s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have levelled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.
President Donald Trump, who had earlier been encouraging US states to reopen, denies having supported Mr Kemp’s controversial reopening of potentially dangerous businesses.
I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, & barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (& USA)!
The President yesterday signed off on another relief bill for small business and hospitals worth $A800 billion.
At a press briefing after the signing, he dismissed criticism about his suggestion Thursday that perhaps medical experts could look at the possibility of injecting disinfectant intp COVID-19 patients, saying it had been a “sarcastic” remark aimed at reporters.
BUSINESSES IN THE STATES FEAR THE LONG TERM
In Georgia, David Huynh had 60 clients booked for appointments Friday at his nail salon in Savannah.
He said that’s less than half the customers he would normally see.
But he’s also starting back with fewer nail technicians to allow for empty work stations between them.
Mr Huynh’s business, Envy Nail Bar, has been closed since March 26.
But the losses extend beyond just the month he’s been shut down.
“We lost graduations, proms and weddings,” Mr Huynh said. “Already I see stores closing down permanently. ... A lot of people don’t realise, if the nation stays shut down any longer, there will be severe consequences.”
Governor Kemp’s order allowing certain businesses to reopen requires precautions such as screening customers for potential symptoms, providing staff with masks and other protective gear as available and doing frequent cleaning.
The governor has said it’s imperative to begin easing his state’s economic suffering.
The Georgia Department of Labor announced that 1.1 million workers - about one-fifth of the state’s workforce - filed for unemployment in the five weeks since the crisis started. The national figure is 27 million.
Public health experts have warned that reopening too quickly could trigger a coronavirus resurgence.
Preventing that will require increased testing and robust tracking of infected people’s contacts. Georgia has ranked in the bottom 10 of states for testing per capita.
But the state is showing progress.
Shannon Pengitore, a massage therapist in Marietta outside Atlanta, had a few clients ask for appointments this week.
But she’s not ready, saying she hasn’t seen clear protocols from the state for protecting herself and her clients.
“Massage therapy is continual contact with the customer for long periods of time in a small room,” Pengitore said.
“If I’m not really comfortable with this, what’s getting transmitted to them? It’s a lot of anxiety.”
Starting Monday, Georgia will allow movie theaters to reopen and restaurants to resume dine-in service - as long as customers are kept at a distance. Restaurants are allowed to re-open in Alaska.
Chef Hugh Acheson, who owns three fine-dining restaurants in Athens and Atlanta, said Georgia’s conducting too little testing to safely reopen. He also doubts it would be profitable.
“If I open up fine dining in midtown Atlanta and ... 25 people show up to dinner because I’m brazen enough to do this, that’s not enough to make money and stay in business,” Acheson said.
Bethany Farmer works at an Atlanta yoga studio and tends bar at a burger joint.
She said neither has asked her to return yet, and that’s fine with her. She fears slow business would mean reduced wages, and the virus remains too much of a threat.
“I could be a carrier even if I don’t feel anything,” Farmer said. “I get worried about all the other people I would encounter.”
SCOTT MORRISON ANNOUNCES NEW GUIDELINES, APP
Scott Morrison has said new guidelines are coming on a range of restrictions in place, and Australians can expect the COVID-19 contact tracing app soon.
Mr Morrison said the app to automate contact tracing was now in the final stages of development, and that rapid response measures were being bolstered to handle outbreaks.
The Australian Government’s controversial app will store users’ personal information in a central database hosted by US tech giant Amazon, it was confirmed today.
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the database would be hosted on servers within Australia and it would be “illegal” for the multibillion-dollar company to use the information for any other purpose than for what it was originally intended.
The national contract to store the details of Australian app users and coronavirus carriers was awarded to the Seattle-based firm after an invitation-only tender organised by the Department of Home Affairs.
The Digital Transformation Agency, which has taken over the project, also confirmed it would store decryption keys for the information on the same servers as the information itself, even though security experts advise against this practice.
It’s understood the decryption keys will be protected by Amazon software.
The app, which is due to be released within weeks, will be based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, and will use Bluetooth beacons to track whether users have been within 1.5m of one another for 15 minutes or longer.
If an app user is later diagnosed with COVID-19, state-based health officials will use information gathered by the app to identify and notify their close contacts.
Mr Morrison said the app would be released “soon,” but added “there are still some issues we’re working through”.
He said the Federal Government had worked with Amazon “on many, many sensitive issues” in the past.
But Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub executive director Dali Kaafar said the decision to host this information offshore with a foreign company would not help to allay fears about user privacy. “This will likely raise more concerns or more questions,” he said.
“That will be also an important tool for the country as we seek to manage how we live in a COVID-safe economy and community into the future,” he said.
“And the rapid response to individual outbreaks – we should be aware, as a community right across the country, that when we take further steps to ease restrictions, of course, we will continue to see outbreaks. That is to be expected. What matters is being able to move on them quickly.”
The national cabinet, which met this morning, has also agreed to put in place national principles to guide the resumption of sport and recreation, including at a professional level.
“So, the major sporting codes, our Olympic sports, training arrangements that sit around support for those activities, by elite sportspeople,” he said.
“Secondly, at the community competitive sport level. That is such an important part of our way of life here in Australia, and the principles that can help guide decisions by states and territories in the future.
“And, thirdly, at the individual passive level of sport and recreation. Activities from everything from – whether it’s in the shire, if you’re going surfing, or if you’re walking in the local national park, or whatever it might happen to be, those set of principles that states and territories can draw on in terms of getting some consistency across the country as we move into this next phase.”
And national safe workplace principles have also been locked in, with Mr Morrison saying his focus was on getting Australians back to work.
“This is all about getting Australians back to work, and ensuring that when they go back to work that they and their families can feel safe in going back to work, and to ensure that there are important principles in place, there are protocols and procedures that, should a COVID case present in a workplace, then the rules that people need to follow …,” he said.
Schools do not have to keep children 1.5 metres apart, the national cabinet has agreed.
Mr Morrison said the national medical expert panel had confirmed the social distancing measure – along with one person per four square metres – did not apply in classrooms for kids.
Aged care homes face having to seek approval for locking down their facilities, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison declaring he will not cop “having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people.”
“That’s not okay,” the PM told reporters this afternoon. “We are not going to have these as secret places, where people can’t access them.”
Shutting off homes was only valid if there was a “very real and serious medical reason”, as had been the case in parts of northwest Tasmania and western Sydney, Mr Morrison said.
Mr Morrison said he, along with the state and territory leaders, were “concerned about restrictions beyond the baseline requirements of what National Cabinet has agreed, based on the expert medical advice.”
“Should we not see an improvement in this area, under the voluntary arrangements that we currently have in place,” he said, “the Commonwealth would be moving to require aged care facilities that wish to have an exemption to those national principles, those national arrangements, then they would need to seek authority to do that from the Commonwealth, and we would make such a decision in consultation with the relevant state and territory jurisdiction.
“We would very much like to keep these things on a basis where aged care facilities are exercising their proper discretion,” he said.
One week after the national cabinet agreed to a four-week timeline to consider easing restrictions in the middle of May, Mr Morrison said: “Good progress is being made on the core requirements … that will enable our road back.”
Testing regimes are being expanded across the states and territories, which he said was a “very important pillar” to deal with the virus in the future.
New modelling, released by the Prime Minister and Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy, shows the effective reproduction rate remains below one – meaning each infected patient is spreading the virus to fewer than one other person on average.
Prof Murphy said the country needed to be “incredibly vigilant” about outbreaks – like the one seen in Victoria today.
The national cabinet will meet again next Friday.
TRUMP TO SIGN BILL FOR NEARLY $US500 BILLION IN VIRUS AID
President Donald Trump will hold a signing ceremony for a bill providing a nearly $500 billion ($A784 billion) infusion of coronavirus spending, rushing new relief to employers and hospitals buckling under the strain of a pandemic that has claimed almost 50,000 American lives and 1 in 6 US jobs.
The measure passed Congress almost unanimously Thursday, but the lopsided tally belies a potentially bumpier path ahead as battle lines are being formed for much more ambitious future legislation that may prove far more difficult to manoeuvre through Congress.
The bipartisan measure passed as politicians gathered in Washington as a group for the first time since March 27, adopting stricter social distancing rules while seeking to prove they can do their work despite the COVID-19 crisis.
Politicians’ face masks and bandannas added a sombre tone to their effort to aid a nation staggered by the health crisis and devastating economic costs of the pandemic.
“Millions of people out of work,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 deaths, a huge number of people impacted, and the uncertainty of it all.”
Anchoring the bill is the Trump administration’s $US250 billion ($A392 billion) funding request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses.
The payroll program provides forgivable loans so businesses can continue paying workers while forced to stay closed for social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
Each day brings new evidence of the economic calamity wrought by the virus. Over the last five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 US workers.
DISINFECTANT MAKER REBUFFS TRUMP’S BIZARRE IDEA
The parent company of Lysol and another disinfectant warned that its products should not be used as an internal treatment for the coronavirus after President Donald Trump wondered about the prospect during a White House briefing.
Trump noted on Thursday that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if they could be injected into people, saying the virus “does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”
That prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants Lysol and Dettol, which said it was issuing a statement to combat “recent speculation.”
“As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” said the statement from Reckitt Benckiser.
Trump has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine as he encourages states to move to reopen their economies.
On Thursday, the White House also pitched “emerging” research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity in diminishing the threat of the coronavirus.
Past studies have not found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus.
But William Bryan of the Department of Homeland Security said at a White House briefing Thursday that there are “emerging results” from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air.
He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity.
A biocontainment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said.
“The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,” Bryan said. Trump was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida.
“I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that’s great,” Trump replied, adding, “It’s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man.”
“I’m here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned,” the president said.
Bryan stressed that the emerging results of the light and heat studies do not replace social distancing recommendations.
Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there’s no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures.
Researchers convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analysed studies done so far to test virus survival under different laboratory conditions as well as tracking where and how COVID-19 has spread so far.
“Given that countries currently in ‘summer’ climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,” the researchers wrote earlier in April in response to questions from the White House Office of Science and Technology.
In addition, the report cited the global lack of immunity to the new virus and concluded, “if there is an effect of temperature and humidity on transmission, it may not be as apparent as with other respiratory viruses for which there is at least some pre-existing partial immunity.” They noted that during 10 previous flu pandemics, regardless of what season they started, all had a peak second wave about six months after the virus first emerged.
In March, Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation’s emergencies chief. said, “We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.”
AUSTRALIA RULES OUT MORE TAX HIKES
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has ruled out any tax increases in response to the coronavirus-induced economic storm.
The government is considering wide-ranging reform in the October federal budget, which shapes as a crucial juncture in the national recovery.
“Tax increases are off the table because you don’t want to make it harder for businesses to be successful,” Senator Cormann told Sky News on Friday.
It comes as leaders will examine Australia’s very low rate of coronavirus transmissions amid further discussions about the plan for lifting social restrictions.
After the first week of a four-week holding pattern, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says things are looking good.
“We are on the road back – and that is demonstrated by the measures that we already have taken – and we are on the way back to a COVID-safe economy as well,” he told reporters on Thursday.
National cabinet will consider the latest Australian modelling when it meets today.
While the data pool is still small given Australia’s success in containing the virus, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said experts were able to draw sound scientific conclusions from it.
The transmission rate is one of the main pillars governments and their health advisers are looking at as they seek to map out the way forward. The other crucial steps are ensuring hospital capacity and medical supplies, and boosting tracing and testing regimes.
The number of people allowed to be at events is likely to be considered in the first round of easing restrictions.
UK DEATH TOLL RISES
The UK coronavirus death toll has risen to 19,506 after 768 more hospital deaths were recorded on Friday.
So far, 143,464 have tested positive for the killer bug in Britain - up 5386 from Thursday.
Friday’s rise in deaths was higher than Thursday’s, when 638 more fatalities were announced.
It is the lowest death rate, however, recorded on a Friday for the third week in a row.
The number of deaths recorded between Monday and Friday this week was also down 13 per cent on figures recorded over the same period the week before.
In England, 17,373 people have died after 587 more deaths were announced today - including 34 healthy people.
The rise is higher than it was on Thursday, but is the lowest death rate recorded in England on a Friday so far this month.
In Scotland, 1184 patients have now died from the killer bug - up by 64 since yesterday.
Nicola Sturgeon also announced today that 9697 Scots have also tested positive for the virus.
In Wales, 751 have died after 110 more covid-19 deaths were announced today.
It is a far greater rise than was announced in Wales yesterday, which Public Health Wales explained is down to 84 retrospective deaths from March and April.
As Britain’s death toll rises, recent stats suggest it could in fact be 40 per cent higher than reported.
Figures revealed at the start of the week showed 13,121 coronavirus fatalities occurred in England and Wales up to April 10 - compared to the 9288 announced at the time.
It would suggest as many as 26,000 may have already died.
The difference is down to deaths that happened outside hospital - including at care homes, hospices and private homes - as well as delays in recording fatalities.
Officials admitted this week that care homes were hit with as many as 400 coronavirus deaths a day over the Easter bank holiday weekend alone.
Shocking new data also shows that black coronavirus patients are dying at almost twice the rate of white Brits in NHS hospitals.
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that businesses which have re-opened after shutting down over the coronavirus crisis were “never required to close”.
Mr Hancock welcomed the move by firms to get people back to work amid signs Brits are growing tired of the shutdown.
Large companies such as B&Q, house builders Taylor Wimpey and car makers Jaguar and Nissan have all started re-opening their doors as fears grow over the damage the economy is facing over the lockdown.
Appearing on Sky News, Mr Hancock said companies were never required to shut down - so long as they could operate with adequate social-distancing.
He said: “The things that are restarting are things that we never required to close in the first place, but what the companies have been doing is working out how they can have safe working following the social distancing rules whilst people are at work.
“Throughout we’ve allowed hardware stores to stay open, and the construction industry, but what businesses have been doing is taking the last couple of weeks to work out ‘ok how do you stay open and stay within the social-distancing rules at work?’
“So it’s absolutely fine for those businesses to stay open because they were never required to close by the social-distancing rules.”
In the same interview, the Tory MP insisted Britain could not yet ease restrictions despite the number of deaths slowly falling.
Mr Hancock urged the nation to keep following the guidelines and not let up just because some shops were re-opening.
He said: “The truth is, it’s still too soon, safely, to change those measures.
“Although the number of people who died yesterday was lower, it was still over 600, so it’s still too high.
AFRICA DANGEROUSLY BEHIND IN GLOBAL RACE FOR VIRUS GEAR
Africa’s coronavirus cases have surged 43 per cent in the past week but its countries are dangerously behind in the global race for scarce medical equipment.
Ten nations have no ventilators at all.
Outbid by richer countries, and not receiving medical gear from top aid donor the United States, African officials scramble for solutions as virus cases climb past 27,000.
Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent’s 1.3 billion people this year. Very few are in hand.
“We are competing with the developed world,” said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The very future of the continent will depend on how this matter is handled.”
Politicians instinctively try to protect their own people and “we know that sometimes the worst in human behavior comes out,” said Simon Missiri, Africa director with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, urging an equitable approach to help developing nations.
The crisis has jolted African nations into creating a pooled purchasing platform under the African Union to improve negotiating power.
Within days of its formation, the AU landed more than 100,000 test kits from a German source. The World Health Organization is pitching in; it has reported fewer than 2,000 ventilators across 41 African countries.
Africa also benefits from the UN’s largest emergency humanitarian operation in decades, with medical cargo including hundreds of ventilators arriving in Ethiopia this month and sent to all countries across the continent.
Another shipment from the Jack Ma Foundation is on the way.
But Africa isn’t holding out a begging bowl, Nkengasong said.
Instead, it’s asking for a fair crack at markets - and approaching China for “not donations. Quotas that Africa as a continent can purchase.”
Such efforts are a response to a global thicket of protectionism: More than 70 countries have restricted exports of medical items, putting Africa in a “perilous position,” the UN says.
New travel bans have closed borders and airports, badly wrenching supply chains.
“It’s like people hoarding toilet paper, which I still don’t understand,” Amer Daoudi, the UN World Food Program’s senior director of operations, told The Associated Press.
“Countries in Europe and North America are paying attention to their own internal needs, but we think that will ease off very soon.”
While nations that are traditionally the world’s top humanitarian donors are distracted, the WFP, the UN’s logistics leader, heaved the emergency operation into place with unprecedented reach. Normally in about 80 countries, this effort involves almost 120, Daoudi said.
The WFP seeks $US350 million ($A549 million—) to keep the operation running for Africa and elsewhere, delivering aid for the pandemic and other crises like HIV and cholera that need drugs and vaccines to keep flowing. Africa imports as much as 94 per cent of its pharmaceuticals, the UN says.
“I’ve never been involved in anything like this before. I don’t think any of us have,” said Stephen Cahill, WFP’s director of logistics. “We’re seeing countries taking measures we think aren’t always rational. When you start closing borders, we start to get very nervous.”
Some African nations, after securing medical equipment, have complicated delivery by causing cargo to stall at ports; 43 have closed their borders. The global supply crisis is so pressing that the UN General Assembly this week approved a resolution urging countries to immediately end “speculation and undue stockpiling.” Separately, China said it won’t restrict exports of needed medical goods.
Developing regions are taking different approaches. China is the main source of help in Southeast Asia. In South Asia, several countries have committed to India’s proposed COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Small South Pacific island nations have teamed up to get equipment. And some Latin American nations are trying to free equipment stuck in US ports or making supplies themselves. But the global disruptions are especially felt across Africa, where governments that have historically underfunded health systems are partnering in an effort that’s been compared to going to war.
Digital “proof of vaccination” certificates will be displayed on smartphone apps as part of the nation’s vaccine rollout.
The prime minister has been accused of “going missing” on coronavirus issues including quarantine and state border closures.

A swimmer who defied police after crowds forced the closure of several Sydney beaches has complained his civil liberties were breached. It follows news a fifth resident has died at a western Sydney nursing home after testing positive to COVID-19.

A swimmer who flouted social distancing rules has complained about his civil liberties being taken away after beaches in Sydney’s eastern suburbs closed at lunchtime today.
Only five days after being reopened from a month-long closure, lifeguards and police were forced to close fences and move people off Coogee, Clovelly and Maroubra beaches.
It follows news a fifth resident has died at a western Sydney nursing home after testing positive to COVID-19.
But the fences, signs and messages did not stop one man at Coogee who jumped the fence
before sprinting for the crystal clear, blue water.
A NSW police officer shouted at the man to get out of the water before a lifeguard on a jet ski spoke to him as he was floating near the shore.
After speaking to police on the beach he said he was not fined.
“Who made these laws?” he said. “Who thinks they’re above the law – the politicians. I did not vote for them, who voted for them? We’re smart enough to vote for them but we’re not smart enough to go for a swim.
“Someone has to stand up to these people, they’re taking our civil liberties who gave them the right?”
Randwick City Council Mayor Danny Said said he hoped the man who ran across the sand was fined: “You have to take a bit of personal responsibility.”
Beaches in the eastern suburbs were closed in March after locals and tourists flouted social distancing restrictions.
A Randwick City Council spokeswoman confirmed to The Daily Telegraph the beaches were closed today due to breaches in social distancing rules.
“There were too many people and lifeguards are now in the process of closing them all down,” she said.
“We found that there were lots of kids and families paddling at the shoreline, which increased numbers on the sand.”
Tourist Mark Tucek from the Czech Republic came to Coogee from Bondi Junction for a quick swim and a walk.
“Waverley Council announced they would keep them (the beaches) closed til next Tuesday so we came here instead,” Mr Tucek said.
“In my opinion the council could employ people to keep people apart so we can still use the beaches.”
The closures came only hours after the state’s top cop warned the beaches would be closely monitored.
“We hope people go down there and exercise, have a swim, then dry off and go home, and really give someone else the opportunity to go down to the beach,” NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said.
Despite the closures, Waverley Council remains on track to open access to the water at their beaches.
“We’re going to try on open access on Tuesday. We thought carefully about when we wanted to try this again,” Waverly Mayor Paula Masselos told The Daily Telegraph.
“Our community is on board with the plan and they have been doing the right thing. They want access to the water to be opened. Our challenge is dealing with the tourists and visitors but we are lucky our lifeguards are experienced in dealing with big numbers.”
FIFTH DEATH AT NEWMARCH
A fifth resident of Anglicare’s virus-plagued Newmarch House nursing home has died after testing positive to COVID-19, taking the state’s death toll to 35 this evening and the national death toll to 79.
Anglicare Sydney released a statement confirming the 96-year-old woman, who suffered from multiple health issues, had died this morning at the facility in Caddens in Sydney’s west.
CEO of Anglicare Sydney Grant Millard said he was “thankful” a close relative had visited the woman on Thursday night before her death, and once again asked for “thoughts and prayers” during the outbreak.
“We grieve with the family, our staff who have cared for her, other residents who have come to know her, and everyone who has been thinking and praying for us during this difficult time,” Mr Millard said. “Please keep everyone in your thoughts and prayers.”
It follows the deaths of a 79-year-old female resident on Thursday morning and a 92-year-old woman on Tuesday morning.
Two male residents aged 93 and 94 also died from COVID-19 inside the nursing home last weekend.
Just seven people returned positive results for COVID-19 overnight, despite more than 7000 people presenting for testing yesterday.
TESTING RAMPED UP TO 8000 A DAY
Anyone who feels unwell or is concerned they might have COVID-19 can now come forward for testing after the government broadened the testing criteria.
The Daily Telegraph revealed today NSW residents can now step forward for COVID-19 testing as the government works to boost testing rates to 8000 a day.
Previously, just those people who have been in contact with an infected person, were part of a known cluster or who work with vulnerable people could be swabbed for the virus.
Ms Berejiklian called on all residents to come forward for testing – even on the weekends – to ensure daily testing rates remain high.
It’s hoped the increased testing rates will help the state prepare for a potential lifting of lockdown restrictions in coming weeks, she said.
“As we consider lifting restrictions we have to do more tests,” she said.
$73 MILLION FOR MENTAL HEALTH
The government has boosted access to mental health services across NSW, announcing the expansion of virtual mental health support teams and additional resources on the state’s mental health hotline.
Mental Health Minister Bronwyn Taylor said the government has placed 180 new psychologists into the workforce and boosted frontline support for the 1800 011 511 mental health line to enable it to field an additional 60,000 calls.
“We want this mental health line to be all things to everyone that needs it. If we can allow access to people with a mental health issue we can allow the right pathway to right service at the right time they’re going to get better outcomes,” she said.
The government has also announced it will be expanding virtual mental health support service across every Local Health District in NSW to enable people in the state’s regions to access help when they need it most.
“It’s bringing mental health care to people regardless of your circumstances or where you live.”
“It’s a huge step forward in mentals health provision, particularly in this time of COVID-19.”
New parents will also be able to access free support to help with their newborn’s sleeping routine.
Ms Taylor said Tresillian’s Sleep Well Baby program will be free for all NSW parents from today.
“What that means is every single day from their homes 24 hours a day parents will be able to access the services they need,” she said.
The program offers support for parents of newborn up to children aged 3 to help guide them through getting their baby to sleep. It includes the latest clinical guidance around sleep routines and useful sleep monitoring tools.

Sydneysiders took advantage of the reopening of several beaches in the Randwick City Council area on Tuesday, April 21, as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly beaches were reopened to the public on April 20 for the purpose of exercise only, the local council said. They had been closed for several weeks after a spike in local cases of the virus and previous incidents of people overcrowding the beaches. This video shows people gathered on the sand and promenade, and swimming in the ocean on the Tuesday morning. Strict social-distancing rules remained in place for beachgoers, who were required to maintain the stay at least 1.5 metres apart and to leave the area when not exercising. The state of New South Wales recorded just six new coronavirus cases on Monday, according to reports, the smallest daily increase in around five weeks. Credit: @barzura via Storyful

More than a quarter of residents and staff at a western Sydney nursing home are infected with the deadly virus, and health authorities are scrambling.
NSW health authorities are turning their focus to stopping the spread of COVID-19 cases linked to a western Sydney nursing home where 41 people have become infected.
Anglicare’s Newmarch House in Caddens near Penrith is home to about 100 people, with 27 residents and 14 staff infected with coronavirus as of midday yesterday.
Two male residents of the high-care facility, aged 93 and 94 died over the weekend from coronavirus.
Their deaths brought the state’s COVID-19 death toll to 30.
RELATED: Follow our live coronavirus updates here
A worker with very mild symptoms entered Newmarch House six days in a row, leading Dr Chant to warn even those with minimal symptoms to avoid work and get tested.
“The rationale for that is that the implications for you introducing COVID-19 into those settings can be significant,” Dr Chant told reporters on Monday.
“We are aware that in those settings we see an amplification and spread of COVID-19 and we want to interrupt spread in those settings at the earliest possible time.”
RELATED: What are your chances of dying from coronavirus?
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant says extensive testing has been undertaken at the facility and the focus is now on stopping the spread of the virus in the surrounding community.
But with just six new cases reported in NSW today, both Dr Chant and Premier Gladys Berejiklian said they were pleased by the low current rate of community infection but said it was too soon to relax restrictions.
Among new NSW cases on Monday was a call centre operator in Tuggerah. “We’re pleased with the trends but of course remaining consistently low is the challenge, as is making sure we reduce that community-to-community transmission - that is what can cause a flare-up,” Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Monday. Meanwhile, 19 more crew members of the Ruby Princess cruise ship on Monday tested positive to COVID-19, taking the total number of crew infected to 190. The ship remains docked at Port Kembla, where it will stay until at least Thursday.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard on Sunday thanked the community for its strong response to coronavirus restrictions as modelling done in early March came to light.
The projection examining the effect of tougher measures suggested 700 deaths and 35,000 cases would be recorded in NSW by April 15 if nothing was done.
The state government on Monday, meanwhile, pledged an additional $140 million for agricultural and primary industries in the state amid the pandemic.
“We know the agriculture and primary industry sector isn’t as impacted as others when it comes to the virus, they’re able to keep growing, employ people,” Ms Berejiklian said “They’re able to be supported, especially given the huge hit they took over summer with the bushfires.”

•Sydney beaches reopen for exercise
•NSW records six new COVID-19 cases, one death
•NSW announces $140 million for regional NSW
A string of popular Sydney beaches have reopened to the public as NSW recorded just six new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours as well as one new death.
Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said a 94-year-old man from the Newmarch House aged care facility died overnight after being infected with coronavirus.
The death toll from the outbreak at the facility - which started after an infected worker attended shifts - has now reached two.
Newmarch House has now recorded infections in 14 staff and 27 residents.
SYDNEY’S BEACHES REOPEN
Meanwhile, tough rules around what you can and can’t do remain in place despite Sydney beaches reopening.
The barriers will come down at Coogee, Maroubra and Clovelly beaches after closures more than a month ago to prevent people from gathering amid lockdown restrictions.
Beachgoers will now be able to swim, surf and exercise on the beach but strict rules will prevent people from sunbaking or lazing around on the beach.
Exercising such as walking, sand jogging and other fitness activities will all be allowed on the sand.
Gathering in groups of more than two will also be prohibited and people must maintain a distance of 1.5m between each other.
Police and council staff are set to be monitoring the beach closely and swooping in on rule-breakers
Randwick Council said the decision to lift restrictions came after the spread of the virus slowed.
“I need to stress that our beaches are not open to general use and can only be accessed for exercise. Activities such as sitting on the sand, sunbaking or gathering in groups will not bepermitted and Council staff and police will be enforcing these restrictions,” Randwick Council Mayor Danny Said explained.
“I urge everybody to do the right thing and practice social distancing while exercising so that we can maintain access for exercise purposes and get through this difficult period together.”
$140M FOR REGIONAL NSW
The government will spend more than $140 million to help support regional and rural industries like agriculture, horticulture and timber.
Deputy Premier John Barilaro said the cash splash will help businesses that have been hit by the tragedy of the bushfires and the fallout from COVID-19.
“This means dairy farmers will be able to buy dairy equipment. Or in horticulture, trellising or nets for our orchard growers.
“Or in the timber industry making sure we can access the burnt resource that is as valuable today as a burnt product as it was when it was a live tree,” he said.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the funding “will support the recovery and resilience of key industries by backing projects that retain and create jobs”.
It comes after the government announced a separate $100 million package to fast track maintenance projects across rural NSW in government-owned assets.
Mr Barilaro said the money will help keep bushfire impacted regions going despite COVID-19 shutdowns.
“Bushfire impacted towns cannot afford to suffer further job losses and economic downturn, which is why we are delivering this funding to keep our key regional industries in business,” he said.

There are more than 6600 confirmed coronavirus cases across Australia, with the death toll sitting at 72.
Australia’s coronavirus toll rose to 72 after another death was announced today.
A third resident at a coronavirus-plagued nursing home in Sydney has died after contracting COVID-19.

Australia's slow escape from the coronavirus pandemic won't be easy - but a massive outbreak in another country has helped health authorities see a way out.
Australia is planning its slow exit out of the coronavirus pandemic with health authorities looking to other countries for lessons and advice.
One of the lessons Australian health authorities looked to was an outbreak in New Zealand, where a cluster of 93 coronavirus cases were detected at an Auckland school.
Speaking on ABC Radio tonight, Australia's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said authorities had looked to Marist Girls' College in Auckland as a "great example and lesson for us all".
It is unknown how the virus got into the school and while much of what happened remains a mystery, they have linked the first case to a teacher.
"Marist College in Auckland is a great example and a lesson for us all on what needs to happen when an outbreak occurs," Professor Kidd said.
"This past week the Prime Minister has announced that we have another four weeks of restrictions aheads of us."
As of Sunday night, there are more than 6500 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia, with 2936 in New South Wales, 1328 in Victoria, 1019 in Queensland, 435 in South Australia, 545 in Western Australia, 191 in Tasmania, 103 in the Australian Capital Territory and 28 in the Northern Territory.
The death toll stands at 71, after two elderly residents at the Newmarch House nursing home in western Sydney died.
Sunday's live blog has now closed.
America is under siege right now but the country’s one true hope of defeating the coronavirus doesn’t appear to be going to plan.

A resident of a Sydney nursing home has died from COVID-19 and almost 30 people have tested positive after an infected worker sparked an outbreak.
A resident of a Sydney nursing home has died from coronavirus and 29 people have tested positive, after a worker unknowingly sparked an outbreak.
Testing efforts at Newmarch House in the city’s west will be escalated following the death, which was confirmed today. It takes the national death toll from COVID-19 to 69.
"We are saddened to inform you that a resident of Newmarch House, who tested positive, passed away peacefully this morning," Anglicare COO Gavin Pretorius said in a statement issued to families.
"The resident's family has been contacted, as have all the relevant authorities.
"We would like to assure you that the staff are doing everything possible to care for your loved one. Please be assured of our prayers for you at this challenging time."
Coronavirus cases linked to Newmarch House in the suburb of Caddens are feared to increase after a worker attended the facility for six consecutive days with mild symptoms before testing positive.
Of the total current cases, three are overseas-acquired. At least 20 are contacts of the female employee.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said aged care workers needed to take extra care because COVID-19 was highly contagious in institutional settings such as nursing homes.

Most cases at Newmarch House, which has 96 residents, remain mild and Anglicare says they are being cared for by a specially-trained team.
Anglicare also said it had been working closely with NSW health authorities since the outbreak was reported on April 11.
As a precaution, residents who have previously tested negative are now being retested, Anglicare said in a statement on Friday.
NSW Labor health spokesman Ryan Park has implored the government to enforce daily temperature checks on healthcare and aged care workers, as well as provide extra support and protective equipment in light of the incident.
Ms Chant said earlier in the week that the staff member of Newmarch House who first had the virus there was “distraught” and “mortified” by the situation.
However, state Health Minister Brad Hazzard accused the worker of “not doing the right thing”.
He made the comments despite Premier Gladys Berejiklian telling reporters: “I feel for her and want to tell her directly she did nothing wrong.”
“All of us empathise with her,” Berejiklian said.
“She did the right thing. As soon as she realised she could have been in contact with someone with the illness, she got tested.”
All residents in the home have been isolated in their rooms since last Sunday.

A man is due to face court today, charged with 10 offences after allegedly spitting and coughing on police who stopped him for not complying with COVID-19 directions.
A motorcyclist who allegedly spat at and tried to cough on police officers who stopped him in Sydney is due to face court.
The 31-year-old was spotted riding without a helmet at Beverly Hills in southwest Sydney on Friday afternoon, police said.
After being pulled over, the Tregear man allegedly tried to cough on the officers and spat at them.
He allegedly returned a positive breath test with a 0.079 reading.
The man is due to face Central Local Court on Saturday charged with 10 offences, including low-range drink driving, riding without a helmet, driving unregistered and not complying with COVID-19 directions.
Last month, two men were charged after allegedly coughing on police officers and claiming they had the coronavirus in separate incidents.

RELATED: The only valid excuses for going outside
NSW Assistant Police Commissioner Karen Webb addressed the “very disappointing” incident during a press conference on Saturday.
“It is very traumatic, and that is why this health order around public officials is so important. Because my peers and public officers working at the frontline are putting their lives ahead of other people during this time,” she said.
“To have someone spit or cough at them puts them in no doubt a lot of stress while they wait to see what the results are of the person that coughed or spat – whether they are positive – and what that means for them if they are. But just the theatre that creates … and it is abhorrent to think that someone would spit at another person.”
Police Association of NSW president Tony King says officers are appalled by the behaviour of some members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic “given the exposure to risks that are faced every day by the NSW Police Force”.
“Police officers are working above and beyond the call of duty to give reassurance to the public in a time of public crisis – they should never be targets of abuse,” Mr King said in a statement.
Speaking at a press conference last week, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard announced anyone caught spitting or coughing on these frontline workers would cop an on-the-spot fine of $5000.

Ten people have been diagnosed with coronavirus at a Sydney nursing home after an infected nurse worked six shifts before testing positive.
Ten people have been diagnosed with coronavirus at a Sydney nursing home after an infected nurse worked for six days before testing positive.
The female nurse, who worked at Newmarch House nursing home in Caddens tested positive for COVID-19 yesterday afternoon.
The employee of the Anglicare facility had worked for several days while displaying coronavirus symptoms, according to the ABC.
The female nurse also worked two days at Greystanes Disability Services in Penrith while infected with COVID-19.
Subsequent tests revealed four residents and five other members of staff had contracted coronavirus, according to NSW Health.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said the nurse had only felt mild symptoms was “absolutely mortified” when she found out she had the virus.
“That worker is incredibly distraught about the circumstances,” Dr Chant told reporters this morning.
“I would urge people to remember that the symptoms of COVID can be incredibly mild and the key point is do not go to work.
“It doesn’t matter how mild those symptoms are — runny nose, sore throat, just a scratchy throat in this case — please don’t go to work.
“And I would particularly urge you, if you were associated with providing care to the elderly, the aged and disability to have that incredibly high awareness of even minor changes in your health.”
The NSW Premier and Anglicare said the incident could be subject to a police investigation.

The Newmarch facility has now placed all its residents and staff into quarantine, and all staff will be wearing full personal protective equipment when with residents.
All residents from the Greystanes Disability Services facility have also been placed into quarantine and both will undergo testing.
“We can’t cast blame automatically, let’s wait for the facts,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said yesterday, stating the nurse may not have been aware she was infected.
“If anything intentionally was done that’s a huge issue and police will look into that.”

New South Wales Police has suggested the source of the coronavirus outbreak on the ill-fated Ruby Princess could be linked to a crew member working in the ship's galley, as a criminal investigation continues.

The ship's private operator reportedly allowed for the galley to provide meals for quarantined crew members as late as Saturday despite concerns the kitchen was likely the source of the outbreak.
 
Crew members are still quarantined on board the ship, which is docked at Port Kembla.

Health officials have lowered the bar for testing in at least 12 hot spots areas as they become concerned COVID-19 could be spreading in the community
Residents of 12 areas of New South Wales have been told to contact a doctor immediately for a COVID-19 test if they feel unwell, regardless of whether they are of a particular risk of contracting coronavirus.
The local government areas and suburbs cover a swath of inner city, northern and western Sydney as well as regions around Newcastle and the mid north coast.
Despite the low numbers of people who have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the last 24 hours in NSW, health officials are worried about possible local transmission in parts of the state.
There are now more than 6300 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 61 deaths nationwide. Nine people were diagnosed with coronavirus in NSW yesterday to bring the state’s total infections to 2863.

Speaking this afternoon, NSW Health acting director Dr Christine Selvey revealed the coronavirus hot spots where residents were being urged to get tested if they felt ill.
“These are areas where there have been a few cases with people where we are unable to find out where they got their infection from and some other areas where we are concerned that if the spread of the virus was occurring, we would certainly want to know about it,” said Dr Selvey.
Residents of the Penrith, Liverpool, Blacktown, Cumberland, Inner West, Waverley, Woollahra, Randwick and Ryde local government areas in Sydney as well as the western Sydney suburb of Westmead are being asked to remain vigilant.
The same advice is in place for Lake Macquarie, close to Newcastle, and the Manning Valley on the NSW mid north coast.
“In these areas, if they have even very mild symptoms, (patients are advised to) present to their GP or to one of the COVID-19 clinics or to a hospital and seek testing,” she said.
The general advice has been for people to only seek a COVID-19 test if they have returned from overseas, have been in contact with someone who has travelled or if they have been in contact with someone who tested positive.
However, residents in these areas can now ask for a test simply if they are feeling unwell with similar symptoms to coronavirus.
NSW Health has set up a number of mobile COVID-19 testing stations in known hot spots including at Bondi. The iconic Sydney beach is in the Waverley council area, one of the LGAs where all unwell residents can now ask for a test.
“We’re testing in those areas because we want to make sure that if community transmission is happening, that we are able to know that and that people with COVID-19 are identified early and their contacts traced to interrupt any more spread of the virus in those areas,” Dr Selvey said.
Most people who have tested positive for coronavirus have brought it into Australia from overseas in some form, including on cruises.
These cases are now relatively easy to manage through quarantining overseas arrivals and cruise passengers and testing close contacts.
The big concern is local community transmission where there is no known source for the infection.
If coronavirus spreads unnoticed within local communities it could lead to a surge of new cases just as the Government is looking to contain numbers.
Local transmission now accounts for half of all new cases, although total infection numbers, including those of local transmission, are falling.

A new 45 minute coronavirus test has arrived in Australia, but global demand for the test is high and it remains in short supply locally.
A rapid coronavirus test is now being used at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney allowing patients to receive results within an hour.
The new COVID-19 test is available to critically ill patients and returns results within about 45 minutes. The test was only made available last week in the US and is difficult to source due to high global demand.
The test still requires an uncomfortable nasal swab and searches for genetic evidence of the virus using molecular technology.
Patients with severe respiratory problems can now be quickly assessed at the hospital and can be quickly triaged if they return a positive result.

RELATED: Coronavirus Australia live updates
Dr Paul Preisz, the Medical Director of Emergency Medicine at St Vincent’s, said the hospital only has a limited supply of the new tests.
“It’s not a test we can do on every single patient. We only have a limited number of tests that we can do,” he told reporters today.
The rapid result tests are in short supply and are being reserved for patients with serious symptoms, but will be rolled out to other hospital in regional areas, AAP reported today.
St Vincent’s Hospital is processing the results using a repurposed GeneXpert machine in its emergency department and will also begin trialling another molecular test in the coming days.
Regional NSW towns will soon have access to the same rapid coronavirus tests, which means samples won’t have to be sent to Sydney for analysis.
Broken Hill health workers will repurpose a machine used to rapidly test flu samples over the Easter break, so it can detect the novel coronavirus. More regional areas are expected to follow as specific hardware is imported.
“That is really important, particularly for the more distant sites,” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Friday.

RELATED:  What are your chances of dying from coronavirus?
“Having that point-of-care testing, or testing that comes back in about an hour, is very useful because it gives us more rapid identification of cases.”
Of the 137,000 people tested for coronavirus in NSW since January, 70 per cent have been in Sydney or on the Central Coast.
Dr Chant defended the current turnaround time for testing – which can see results for Sydney-based cases returned within 24 hours.
“The issue for rural and remote areas is the time it takes for specimens to come down to Sydney,” she said.
“As we get more (novel coronavirus) cartridges for our GeneXperts, we will be looking at deploying this test across various sites.
“We’ll have a mind to supporting rural and regional communities so we can give them access to the testing that is much more prompt in the metropolitan area.”
NSW has so far recorded 2822 cases and 22 deaths from COVID-19.

The COVID-19-hit Ruby Princess cruise ship docked in Port Kembla, on the south coast of New South Wales, on April 6 as state police launched a criminal investigation into the disembarkation of its passengers when some were carrying the coronavirus. New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the investigation would determine if national biosecurity laws or state laws were broken when the passengers were released. The Ruby Princess was the biggest single largest source of COVID-19 cases in the Australian state as of April 7, with more than 620 cases and 11 deaths linked to the vessel, according to local media. The ship was still carrying more than 1,000 crew — one-fifth of whom were exhibiting coronavirus symptoms — when it docked at Port Kembla to take on fresh supplies, reports said. It was not clear how the crew would be repatriated to their home countries. Credit: @kaylahlenhart via Storyful

South Australia has recorded its first coronavirus death, SA Health has announced.
South Australia has recorded its first coronavirus death, SA Health has announced.
The man, 75, from Adelaide’s north-east suburbs, died in the Royal Adelaide Hospital last night after fighting for life in its intensive care unit.
His family have been left devastated.
The Advertiser has been told the man had recently attended a wedding in Melbourne, in which some attendees had travelled from Italy.
This story is no longer being updated. Please go here to see the latest SA coronavirus updates for April 7.
“Sadly, SA Health can confirm a 75-year-old man from metropolitan Adelaide passed away last night from COVID-19 in the Royal Adelaide Hospital,” a department spokeswoman said on Tuesday morning.
“The man acquired COVID-19 interstate. His passing is the first death in South Australia from COVID-19. Our condolences are with the family and friends of the man.”
It is expected that Premier Steven Marshall will speak publicly about the death after national cabinet this morning.
There are also grave fears for a Riverland grandfather who is also fighting for life in ICU. His family have been told to expect the worst.
An emergency Central Adelaide Local Health Network board meeting last night discussed whether to change rules around allowing the man’s wife to travel down to see her sick husband.
SA Health had no immediate details on the board outcome.
Police Commissioner Grant Stevens told ABC Radio this morning that the state’s first coronavirus death was a sombre reminder to the community.
“We’ve seen some really good results in terms of the number of positive COVID-19 cases in South Australia over the last few days (but) this does serve as a stark reminder that we are dealing with a treacherous enemy that we can’t see, and sadly I don’t think this gentleman will be the last person who will die as a result of COVID-19,” he said.
“The work that the emergency services and health workers are doing to enforce these restrictions and support those people who are testing positive along with the amazing contribution of the community in terms of complying with these restrictions I think is still important today and it will be important for many days to come, maybe even months.”
Mr Stevens said police had issued nine fines and formally cautioned 13 people for not complying with social distancing or self-isolation rules.
Individuals flouting the rules face on-the-spot fines of $1000 while businesses face expiations notices of up to $5000.
Mr Stevens said almost 2900 compliance checks had been carried out in relation to individuals and about 15,000 checks had been conducted on businesses.
“I think that’s a real indicator that there’s a general sense of goodwill within the community that they need to be on board with this and people are trying to do the right thing,” he said.
Only two new cases yesterday
The news comes as concerted community efforts to contain coronavirus are paying dividends with just two new cases recorded in South Australia, for a total of 411, as drastic measures continue to “flatten the curve”.
One patient is aged in their 20s, the other is in their 60s. Nineteen people are in hospital and there are nine in the Royal Adelaide Hospital intensive care unit, six of them critical, three stable. Seven are men and two are women, aged from 44 to 77.
No extra cases have been recorded from the Ruby Princess cruise ship or airport baggage handlers clusters. Cruise ships account for 120 cases and the airport cluster stands at 28, with more expected.
SA Pathology has completed 33,000 tests and officials said demand was quiet over the weekend with just 28 tests at the RAH clinic on Sunday.
Chief Public Health Officer Associate Professor Nicola Spurrier said: “I’d like to extend a big thank you to all South Australians. It is fantastic to have low numbers over the last couple of days and I hope it will continue.”
She stressed it was vital to continue to maintain good hygiene and social distancing.
Today marks 14 days – and the last to check for symptoms – since the last of 41 planes landed at Adelaide with passengers who had the disease before mandatory self-isolation of arrivals came into force.
SA Health officials had gone to great lengths to track fellow passengers sitting near the confirmed cases on each flight but it appears few, if any, were infected in-flight.
While she did not have a figure, Dr Spurrier said flights appeared to be far different to cruise ships, where the disease appeared to spread easily.
Preparing for the peak
New efforts to prepare for the expected peak of patients include training 80 nurses to work in high-level care at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital as an extra 10 intensive care beds and three high-dependency beds are added.
The extra beds will double the WCH’s critical care capacity and, for the first time, the ICU beds will be available for adult women if needed.
Premier Steven Marshall said the beds were part of the plan to be ready for rising numbers of patients.
“The Women’s and Children’s Hospital will be on the frontline of dealing with the most severe cases of this insidious disease,” he said.
“The battle to control the coronavirus pandemic needs to be fought by all of us in changing the way we live.”
Mr Marshall said the strict measures now in place were delivering encouraging results but emphasised: “We cannot take our foot off the brake.”
He said while efforts to “flatten the curve” continue, the state was working to double ICU capacity “so when the peak does hit we have maximum capacity to treat as many people as needed”.
Health and Wellbeing Minister Stephen Wade said: “We know when the COVID-19 pandemic reaches its peak our hospitals need to be ready for any scenario.”
WCH chief executive Lindsey Gough said the 13 extra beds would allow the hospital to continue to deliver high-quality care while dealing with the extra demand.
“We already have enough beds and provisions in place for COVID-19 patients, however we need to ensure we still have enough beds available to care for other patients in need,” she said.
“These three extra HDU beds have been placed in close proximity to the current Paediatric Intensive Care Unit in the event we require them.
“The 10 ICU beds will be on standby to care for both women and children who don’t have the virus.”
Other developments:
• Modelling showed distancing can save 12,000 lives in SA over the next 90 days
• Supermarkets say they are struggling to fill empty shelves in SA
• The US recorded 1200 deaths in a single day, and was told to brace for a shocking week
• Nearly 100 new paramedics were fast-tracked to the frontline in SA
• A historic deal was signed with SA’s private hospitals for more beds and increased ICU capabilities
New anti-virus measures rushed through
A skeleton crew of State Parliament MPs will meet again on Tuesday, as Premier Steven Marshall seeks to push through anti-coronavirus measures.
They include “better protections for landlords and tenants”, and a suite of measures to protect South Australian jobs amid the crisis.
Attorney-General Vickie Chapman said: “We have a strong plan to stop the spread of COVID-19 and minimise the impact on our state”.
Measures include speeding up infrastructure approvals by removing some normal parliamentary oversight, exempting JobKeeper payments from payroll tax and restricting rental evictions in cases of extreme financial hardship.
The Government also wants to allow authorised to use “reasonable force” to detain people under orders by the Chief Public Medical Officer or directions made by the State Coordinator, SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens.
Recycling depots will also be able to pay via EFTPOS as well as cash.
Government officials acting under the direction of emergency powers would also be protected from liability, a move Ms Chapman says will sunsure “they can go about their duties freely, at an especially important time”.
Spike in calls to Lifeline
Counselling service Lifeline experienced its busiest-ever month in March as people struggled to cope with the anxiety prompted by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Lifeline received 88,870 calls from around Australia in March to its 13 11 14 service, 25 per cent more than normal. Last Sunday, 3175 calls were taken, one every 30 seconds, with almost 40 per cent related to COVID-19 concern. The service is expecting April to be even busier.
Numbers for South Australia were not available but it was estimated demand at the local Lifeline service had also jumped by around a quarter,
Lifeline Adelaide practice co-ordinator Kat Wallace said most of the anxiety being felt was not about potentially becoming sick with the virus, but about the sudden social isolation that had been forced on many.
“The lives and the homes of Australians now look completely different to what they did this time last month,’’ Ms Wallace said. “It happened really quickly.’’
“It can leave anyone feeling like they don’t have control over a situation and leave them feeling overwhelmed and unsure. It’s a really unsettling time.’’
She said COVID-19 had also followed other events that had caused distress such as the bushfires and the murder of Brisbane mum Hannah Clarke and her three children.
“There have been really huge things happening that have sent people reeling and now we have this and we are all feeling really isolated.’’
Ms Wallace said this feeling of anxiety and being overwhelmed could happen to anyone, regardless of their station in society.
“We know that a crisis can hit anyone at any point in time,’’ she said. “It doesn’t matter who you are, no one is immune to crisis.
“Even people you would imagine would have the strength and the resources to be able to know what their triggers are and now how to cope can also be confronted by some of this stuff.’’
She said it was important that those under pressure feel comfortable about asking for help.
“Be kind to yourself, be patient and if you recognise you need help, reach out,’’ she said. “It’s normal to feel this level of anxiety, it’s normal to feel unsettled.’’
Call Lifeline on 13 11 14.
Best Easter gift is your blood
Officials are urging an extra 500 South Australians to donate blood as an Easter gift.
Australian Red Cross Lifeblood says patients are currently receiving the blood they need, but an extra 7500 blood and plasma donors are needed by Easter across Australia.
Donations have been drying up as people heed the advice to stay home, with more than 900 appointments a day cancelled nationwide.
“While there could be a number of reasons for this, we know people are changing their routines,” Lifeblood spokeswoman Jennifer Salter said. “We need 29,000 blood donations around Australia each and every week … there is no substitute for blood and we can’t stockpile it.”
Ms Salter stressed that donor centres were safe to visit and excluded from the current advice against non-essential travel, the exceptions being people aged over 70 and anyone who is feeling unwell.
Donor centres have increased disinfecting and use social distancing.
There is no evidence of coronavirus being transmissible via blood transfusion.

SA testing for virus in all respiratory samples
South Australia’s coronavirus testing regime captures people who fall outside strict normal guidelines, a unique move aimed at detecting community transmission to save more lives.
SA Health has now passed the 30,000 mark for coronavirus tests, and is using a stockpile of critical chemicals that it banked up for years but are now in short supply around the globe.
The so-called “background testing” policy means that all respiratory samples sent to SA Pathology for other conditions are also scanned for the presence of coronavirus.
The aim is to see if the virus is loose among people who don’t meet the strict standard coronavirus testing criteria, so officials can stop outbreaks that would otherwise go undetected.
According to the prestigious University of Oxford’s Our World in Data project, SA has been tracking among the places in the world for the highest number of tests per person.
Premier Steven Marshall said that having the best data available, which was becoming the envy of other states and countries, helped him to make right calls on SA’s local situation.
“Every time we take a respiratory specimen, nasal or oral, we also do the coronavirus test. These are not people that have been authorised to have the COVID-19 test,” he said.
“We have chosen a cohort that will give some indication of what the underlying condition in our population is. Those are background checks that are world-leading practice.
“That is why we know with confidence where we are, and the strength of our data.”
He said that SA Health had moved hard and early to comprehend the challenge.
“This early effort is now paying dividends for SA.
“Our strong plan is to flatten the curve.
“Having accurate data is a critical part of our plan to stop the spread of coronavirus.”
Oxford researchers Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Joe Hasell say good testing is “one of the most important things that countries need to be doing to help understand and stop the spread”.
They say there is significant concern that many countries still have poor testing regimes, making it difficult to know what is happening in their regions and respond in the right way.
“Testing allows infected people to know,” the pair write in a recent article.
“People who don’t know they are infected might not stay at home and thereby risk infecting others.
“Testing is also crucial for an appropriate response to the pandemic. It allows us to understand the spread of the disease and to take evidence-based measures to slow down the spread.”
Individuals who qualify for a coronavirus test in SA are those with the common symptoms and have also travelled overseas in the past 14 days or interstate in the past week.
Those who have been in contact with known cases and have symptoms also qualify, as do healthcare workers with a fever and an acute respiratory infection.
Common indications of acute respirator infections are shortness of breath, cough and sore throat.
Testing has been expanded to deal with particular SA outbreaks, like people who have been at Adelaide Airport since a cluster was found in baggage handlers, and a special Barossa clinic.
No shortage in flu shots, Premier says
Premier Steven Marshall says an apparent shortage of flu shots is possibly because people are getting them earlier this year.
He said he would speak to Health Minister Stephen Wade about the shortage, after reports emerged of pharmacies cancelling appointments at the weekend.
At the weekend, SA had 13 news cases – 11 on Saturday and two on Sunday, the smallest rise in COVID-19 in weeks.
The Premier told ABC News this morning SA had ordered “more flu vaccines than even last year”.
“I think there’s a general high level of anxiety for people who are jumping in early to get those earlier,” he said.
“The pattern of people going to get the flu vaccine has completely changed this year, but my understanding is that we’ve got plenty of flu vaccines. We’ll have more to say about that later today.”
Mr Marshall also said SA’s COVID-19 numbers had been increased by cruise ships.
The Ruby Princess docks in NSW today, with about 200 crew members suffering coronavirus-like symptoms.
Cruise ships have resulted in 120 of SA’s cases, the majority from the Ruby Princess when it docked in Sydney last month.
“It’s a disaster, let’s be quite clear,” he said.
“The reality is that South Australia was disproportionately affected. I think now we’re over 125 infections that come off of cruise ships.
”I don’t know what it is about South Australians and cruising, but we have been disproportionately affected with well over a quarter, heading towards a third, of all of our cases from cruise (ships), and that’s really skewing our figures on the national stage.”
A criminal investigation has begun into how the Ruby Princess was allowed to disembark hundreds of passengers that brought COVID-19 into the community.
SA had two new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, as the State Government said nearly 100 new paramedics would be fast-tracked into frontline service.
It also announced a deal with the state’s private hospitals at the weekend, underwriting them to open 1700 beds, increase SA’s intensive care unit capabilities by 40 per cent and keep medical staff in jobs.
Senior Government sources also revealed concerns about how the public system would cope if private hospitals closed after all non-elective surgeries were cancelled last week to shore up beds.
The partnership would include public-sector use of wards and theatres, essential equipment such as ventilators, as well as personal protective equipment supplies from all private hospitals.
SA virus cases by day
Calls to expanded MedSTAR
Seriously ill or injured country patients may die waiting for a retrieval to a city intensive care unit as coronavirus threatens to overwhelm retrieval services, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia warns.
SA Ambulance Service’s MedSTAR retrieval service is already facing changes to deal with the looming surge in demand.
Rural Doctors Association of Australia president Dr John Hall said retrieval capacity needs to be drastically increased to deal with the transfer of infectious and seriously ill patients.
“Looking at the numbers that are coming in from overseas, we know we are going to need two to three times the retrieval capacity currently available,” Dr Hall said.
“With the expected surge in seriously unwell COVID-19 cases presenting in rural areas, we are concerned there will be significant delays in retrieval, leaving these patients ventilated for days in rural hospitals that are not equipped or staffed for this type of care.
“It is entirely possible we will see coronavirus patients dying while waiting for transfer.
“We also need to ensure that beds are made available in regional and city hospitals to admit rural patients.”
Health and Wellbeing Minister Stephen Wade said “significant discussions” are now underway to manage retrievals as COVID fuels demand.
“One of the particular goals being pursued is to have more centralised co-ordination of retrievals and bed placements — one of the of the great frustrations of rural doctors and health professionals for many years has been the challenge from time to time of getting a bed,” he said.
“Particularly in the COVID environment we want to improve our performance there.”

After 12 years at the helm of the Rural Fire Service leading New South Wales through some of its worst bushfires seasons, Shane Fitzsimmons will step down and move into a new, broader role. 

He will now use his expertise to head a new disaster recovery agency - Resilience NSW - helping the state deal with bushfires, drought and the worsening coronavirus crisis. 

Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday, Mr Fitzsimmons said stepping down from his position with the Rural Fire Service was not easy, but he was passionate about the new position. 

After a horror 2019 and start to 2020, Mr Fitzsimmons assured there was a lot of work to be done in his new disaster recovery role. 

“In NSW we’ve seen this compounding effect of disasters impacting communities, often the same communities,” he said. 

“We’ve had extraordinary drought conditions, water deficits right across the landscape, that were really impacting regional NSW, on top of that, we had the worst bushfire season in NSW history, with 25 lives lost, and now we’ve seen floods and storms. 

“And now everybody is the subject of the awful effects of this COVID-19 pandemic.”

The husband of a woman who died after they travelled on the Ruby Princess has slammed the decision to allow passengers to disembark.
A man whose wife died from coronavirus after they were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship has said the pair should never have been allowed to board the vessel.
Jerry and Janet Lieben were two of 2700 passengers who travelled on the Princess Cruises ship on a round trip from Sydney to New Zealand.
There is now a criminal investigation taking place into why the Ruby Princess was allowed to offload its passengers on its return to Sydney’s Circular Quay despite many of them displaying flu-like symptoms. One woman was met by an ambulance.

RELATED: Follow the latest coronavirus updates
The passengers were allowed to return to their homes, across Australia and beyond. More than 600 have now tested positive for COVID-19, making up some 10 per cent of Australia’s total number of infections.
Several of those passengers have now died from the virus.
Talking to Channel 9’s A Current Affair last night, Mr Lieben said he wanted “justice” for his wife who didn’t deserve to die.
“In the beginning I felt sorrow and everything else, but now I feel a bit angry and after what happened. I just thought, 'I need justice for my beautiful wife because none of this should have happened',” Mr Lieben said.
“We should not have been allowed to board that ship.”
The Vietnam War veteran said he was initially reluctant to take the cruise but was persuaded to go because there was to be an army reunion on-board.
However, he said became wary when their boarding time kept being pushed back.
“That whole day we were getting text messages from the ship saying that boarding was delayed from half past one to five, and then they said it is still delayed because New South Wales Health has got control of the ship and they were doing a check because there was some people crook on-board,” Mr Lieben said.
But he insisted no mention was made of COVID-19. That’s despite it later emerging that several sick passengers left the Ruby Princess on the previous cruise.
Their holiday was curtailed when the coronavirus crisis deepened, which Mr Lieben imagined would lead to the thousands on-board being checked for signs of infection prior to leaving the ship.
“But nothing happened … we collected our luggage, but nothing got checked. It was just bang and we were off,” he said.
LAST WORDS He said they were told to self-isolate at home for 12 days, but that was it, and passengers were allowed to board trains, buses and planes.
Within a day of returning to their home in Orange, in the NSW central west, the Liebens began to show symptoms, with both returning a positive result.
Mrs Lieben wife was later admitted to hospital.
Mr Lieben said he told his wife he loved her the last time he saw her while she was struggling for life in a hospital bed.
“She was really getting upset, I combed her hair and told her I loved her and left the room and that's the last I seen her,” he said.
“She was the love of my life … we had a tremendous life together.”
A criminal investigation, led by the NSW Police’s homicide squad, will look into the circumstances behind why the Ruby Princess was allowed to dock and decant its passengers despite probable cases of coronavirus on-board.
The ship is now docked at Port Kembla, near Wollongong, with several members of its crew also having tested positive for the virus.

Fitzgibbons is holed up down at Gerroa, about a hundred clicks south of Sydney, training for a world title race that may not happen.
Preparing for an Olympic Games barely visible on the horizon. She wants to keep surfing, but she wants to do it in the right way.
She will forever need and crave and seek the daily flush of salt water and early-morning beams of sunlight that have always fed her spirit but now the world is tucked in bed, either feeling crook or trying to avoid the big cough, she knows she has to ride alone.
“What we’re all going through is wild,” she says. “I want to be super-respectful to everyone out there who’s in a hectic situation, but I’m pretty blessed to be back where I’ve grown up. It’s just this tiny little headland, where we are. It’s its own isolation bubble at the best of times. I’ve got everything I need to be really self-sufficient.
“I’ve got my Rocky gym set up in the garage. I’ve got a pool for recovery sessions. I’ve got a handful of waves I can walk to.
“I feel like it’s still OK to be outdoors and free and open to roam — because there’s no one around. I’m very conscious of following all the rules, I really am.
“I’m lucky enough for all this to be my job, so I feel like I’m still working at my job — when there’s absolutely no chance of contact with anyone else.”

BRING ON THE GAMES: SALLY’S SHOT AT TOKYO OLYMPICS
The World Surf League is meant to be having its Easter pilgrimage to Bells Beach this week. For the first time since 1971, there may be no surfing world champions this year. Fitzgibbons’s normal schedule would be mapped out for her travels from Australia to Brazil to Indonesia to South Africa to California to France to Portugal to Hawaii. Now? Not one flight is booked. Not one hotel room.
“The first week of no tour was a bit like, that can’t possibly happen!” she says. “I was thinking, can that happen? I can’t believe that can happen! You can’t hop on a plane. You can’t go where you normally go. That was disbelief.
“I was thinking, OK, the goalposts are moving. But how far are they moving? Then there was the acceptance of, no one knows. We’re all in the same boat. I think now it’s a very neutral space. I don’t know where that story leads.
“I’ve had 15 years on tour so I can feel a bit anxious about not knowing what’s coming up. I think that’s understandable. I think all I can do is wait and be patient.
“Keep training for that pure reason of just wanting to keep developing. This gives you the time and space to do it.
“You’re achieving on your time, time without the validation of contests. You’re training like you’re a kid again, just because you enjoy it.”
Any word from the WSL? One event for the world title? One wave? No events? No world title? What? Bells has been postponed. Will it be on later in the year?
“It’s going to be a pretty wild finish to whatever happens this year,” she says.
“The biggest issue with our sport is that it’s so far-reaching. It’s truly a global sport in terms of the travel but also the athletes. Even if Australia is getting back on track but if America and Europe are not, it’s still difficult to bring everyone together.
“We may see the likes of domestic footy starting back up. You never know with surfing. We might be back on our feet at the end of the year.
“I’ve had 15 years of competing at a certain pace, a fast pace, boom-boom-boom, it’s almost nice to be able to sit and digest everything and contemplate the way I’m doing things.
“We don’t normally have the time. You can get more in-depth now in your development and growth.
“We just have to watch this space about when and if the tour can start again but where I’m lucky enough to be now, I’m still steered every day by the tides and the winds and the different places we still have access to surf.”
Gerroa is about as far removed as you can get from Bondi Beach, now closed because of the madding crowds.
“That’s probably the light-and-shade of what’s going on,” Fitzgibbons says.
“In the densely populated areas, you probably can’t walk out of your apartment block without bumping into people.
“Life is a lot different here. It’s a very small community. You look at some of the bigger beaches — if Snapper up on the Gold Coast is pumping, there will be 400 people out there.
“How does that fit in with social distancing? I don’t know.
“But I have sympathy for anyone who can’t surf. If we stay in our own lanes and respect other people … surfing is our form of biking and running, it’s our form of joyful exercise, so hopefully that can continue for all of us. Fingers crossed!”

The number of COVID-19 cases has climbed to 2389 in NSW, after 91 new cases were confirmed on Thursday. 

Ten people have died from the coronavirus in the state, and 42 people are being treated in ICU, 22 of whom require ventilation. 

NSW health authorities said on Friday 336 cases of locally acquired infection were of particular concern because “we’re not sure of the source”. 

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Friday that shutdown restrictions would likely continue for at least six months. 

“As far as the crisis itself, I don’t care what the Prime Minister said, we’re in it for at least six months. Until there is a cure, a vaccine, this crisis is something we need to deal with and all of us need to come to terms with that,” she said. 

Meanwhile, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said “after a positive day with border force and cruise liners”, two cruise ships were now out of NSW waters. 
Eight cruise ships were anchored of the NSW coast on Thursday, refusing to leave for fear their crew would require NSW health services. 

Mr Fuller said one man was taken off the Ruby Princess cruise ship on Thursday because he required medical assistance and confirmed “we’ll continue to take anyone off those ships who requires NSW Health assistance”. 

He said five other ships with healthy crew on board would now be refueled, restocked and would return to their port of origin.

There’s nothing like that feeling of returning to home soil after a dramatic episode overseas … except when you’re then detained in an Ibis hotel for two weeks, it seems.
A week or so ago a video came out where a bunch of Hollywood celebs marked the global COVID-19 pandemic by forlornly singing John Lennon’s “Imagine”.
As they crooned the lyrics “imagine no possessions” from their Beverly Hills mansions, temperatures around the world shot up, and it wasn’t because we were infected with coronavirus. We were infected with seething jealousy that these sad-faced A-listers were seeming to bemoan their quarantine days in the lap of luxury, while many of us were bouncing off the walls in a dwelling smaller than Natalie Portman’s bathroom.

Yesterday a similar strain of envy reared its head when thousands of international travellers returning to Australia by plane and ship were escorted to see out their compulsory 14-day quarantine in a “makeshift quarantine facility” – otherwise known as a randomly allocated hotel, with the room tab picked up by the Government and a military dude standing near your door.
But as the weary travellers soon discovered, not all makeshift quarantine facilities are created equal.
Some people were sent to the five-star Intercontinental hotel to drink in sparkling views of Sydney Harbour. Others were allocated the budget Ibis Darling Harbour (which let’s face it, is in Pyrmont). The latter began to wonder how they had managed to upset the quarantine gods and cop the Ibis over the InterCon.
The ABC news had snippets of an older gent quarantined in the Ibis saying “these conditions are so basic”, which makes him sound like a moody Millennial if you read it in the right tone.
Another chap posted on Facebook that he “got the short end of the straw”.
We like to think the Reddit video below shows someone who hasn’t been able to cop 12 hours at the Ibis and has made a run for it only to be tackled by police. It’s like The Shawshank Redemption but less moving … and set in Pyrmont.
Army Soldiers and Police arrest outside quarantine hotel Ibis Pyrmont https://t.co/yGdkw5pube #Sydney
But is it really all that bad?
Let’s go to TripAdvisor, where all disgruntled boomers go to let off steam.
On March 15, Manuel C from Canada wrote that the Ibis Pyrmont “is not a hotel for normal people Dis is a DISGUTING Hotel” (sic). But to be fair, the vast majority of recent complaints are about the hotel’s price, which is not something the quarantine guests have to concern themselves with.
It’s worth noting that it’s not only Ibis residents getting snippy.
Lara Worthington tweeted images of a hotel bedroom in Sydney’s inner west that her 63-year-old mother has been sent to isolate in, saying it was “unacceptable”.
People who had been sent to the more up-market Swissotel in Sydney’s CBD were having a grizzle too, and they quickly copped backlash on social media.
Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, who has been tasked with handling the New South Wales coronavirus response, has had just about enough of listening to the complaints. He acknowledged that being in lockdown for two weeks was a bit of a bummer but dismissed the gripes about the hotel accommodation, saying “there are people after the bushfires still living in tents and caravans” … which is a stunningly strong point. But it also reminds us of when mum used to tell you “there are people starving in Africa” when you wouldn’t finish your dinner.
Speaking of dinner, the three free meals being provided each day has also been a source of dismay for many.
This tweet from a lady complaining about the care pack she was given on arrival also got a lot of attention (to be fair, she’s been out of the country and may be unaware that she could possibly exchange those rolls of toilet paper for 900 squeezy yoghurts on the black market).
Self care isolation pack? Doesnât really help feed my toddler. The only food he has been given all day was from a generous cop who shared snacks from his car. It is 5pm and we got off our plane in Sydney at 8am #nswcovidquarantine #notgoodenough ping â¦@ScottMorrisonMPâ© pic.twitter.com/AebWWBSN4p
On Facebook, a returned traveller said her Deliveroo delivery had been rejected by the hotel as it had been deemed a health risk.
“There are three security guards on each floor, police guarding the entrance to the hotel and NOW (sic) we are not allowed to have anything delivered,” she wrote on Friday.
“Prisoners get treated better than we do.”
Another returned traveller at the Swissotel said the arrivals were “prisoners and refugees within our own country” and had been stripped of their “human right and constitutional rights”. To which many people on social media responded “send them to Christmas Island for an undetermined time longer than 14 days so they can see how it compares”.
Finally, let’s take a look at this chap’s post about quarantine conditions in China, which really puts things into perspective. I would dearly love Manuel C from Canada to visit these particular digs and review on TripAdvisor.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/health/coronavirus-australia-covid19-cases-may-not-peak-until-november/news-story/f5648851e5f0285c0bfd0497a1804cbb
New modelling shows the peak of the coronavirus cases in Australia may not be until November, with 5000 ICU patients expected in NSW alone.
Increased social isolation to combat COVID-19 in NSW could shift the peak period of infection to early October, with intensive care units at their busiest in mid-November, expert modelling suggests.
But even if restrictions on movement reduce the reproduction rate to 1.6 – meaning each individual with the disease infects 1.6 others – the state’s ICU capacity could still be overwhelmed, an article published in the ﻿Medical Journal of Australia on Monday finds.
“Under the scenario of increased social isolation, the peak infection will shift to early October and peak ICU utilisation will shift to mid-November and would be around one-third the size of the business-as-usual peak,” the authors from the University of Sydney, Monash University and James Cook University write.
﻿RELATED: Follow the latest coronavirus updates
At that point, some 5 per cent of the population could be symptomatic, with more than 14,000 people in hospital across NSW and 5100 patients in intensive care.
“This represents 585 per cent of the state’s baseline ICU capacity prior to the epidemic,” the authors state.
The infectious diseases modellers note that prior to the coronavirus epidemic there were 874 intensive care beds in NSW.
They argue that even with a doubling of existing services “the available supply is estimated to be substantially less than the peak requirement”. Hospitals and ICU facilities “are likely to be overwhelmed unless transmission can be reduced significantly”, the authors suggest.
Without social distancing measures, peak transmission would be much earlier, in late June, with peak hospitalisation in early July.
Sixteen per cent of the population could be symptomatic, with more than 35,000 people hospitalised and close to 11,800 ICU beds needed, the modelling suggests. That’s 1349 per cent of baseline capacity.
﻿RELATED: All your questions about coronavirus answered
The authors admit, however, that their “compartmental model” approach has several limitations.
It depends upon assumptions including the current reproduction rate, which remains uncertain.
The authors acknowledge the trajectory of the epidemic will be highly dependent upon the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
“The present report does not estimate the effect of more intensive suppression strategies which would be likely to reduce to the peak ICU requirement,” they write.
NSW is enforcing new rules that limit gatherings to two people unless you are with immediate family.
Students are encouraged to stay home from school, and employees are working from home wherever possible.
Those over 70 or with chronic illnesses are advised to stay home unless they require medical care.

IT IS time to think outside the box and look at the solution staring us in the face to help limit the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales.
Twelve kilometres southeast of Grafton, NSW, the Clarence Correctional Centre is sitting empty, a ready-made quarantine facility if ever there was one.
There quite possibly might not be another location on earth so well equipped to deal with an influx of patients required to be isolated from the general population, and the timing is perfect.
As if by fate, just this week many of the contractors finished packing up their tools after three years of construction to hand the finished product over to Serco. Job done, leaving behind a highly secure, state-of-the art facility with unused medical, catering and general community services available at the ready, and, by the sounds of things, an enviable amount of comfort afforded to the criminals who will one day call the 1700-bed facility home.
Clarence Correctional Centre could potentially house all COVID-19 patients from the Northern NSW Local Health District at the peak of this outbreak, and possibly further afield - and such measures are well overdue.
Our nation is now paying for the disastrous decision to let people pour freely through the airport gates, sending those who test positive home in the trust that they will have the common sense to self-isolate and to do it properly.
The effects of this pandemic have already been catastrophic to our economy and will be long-lasting, but the longer it goes the more damaging that impact will be.
FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK: Our commitment as strong as ever
Our nation is sophisticated enough for most sectors to have a safety net of welfare and employee entitlements to fall back on for a period. But like the brain eventually shuts down when oxygen is cut off for long enough, our society as we know it can only survive on life support and no genuine cashflow for so long. It won't take long for the cash splash pool to dry up.
So let's flatten that damn curve and quarantine victims properly - short term pain for long term gain.
The only downside is that the prospect of being sent to a facility like this might make some people hesitant to be tested, and the dangerous ones are not those who are very sick and dying under strict supervision in hospitals - it's those with mild symptoms told to go home and are trusted to do the right thing, or worse still, that don't get tested at all.
<< Follow this link to stay up to date with the latest coronavirus information specific to the Clarence Valley >>
Grafton will soon become home to the largest jail population in Australia when it opens to 1700 inmates later in the year - or whenever the time is right.
But in the meantime, why not gain the more palatable notoriety of being home to the largest and best quarantine facility in the world in the fight against a global pandemic? The time IS right for that.
And what a story to tell on the other side for all the sick law-abiding folk who would otherwise never have set afoot inside a jail in their lives.
We're all having to make a few adjustments. So if we're truly a global community in this fight together, then surely Serco can come to the party.
I think we can safely assume the grip of this pandemic will remain tight when the prisoners are scheduled to arrive at a date yet to be announced between June and August, and surely under these conditions it's not the time to be working out the logistics of transporting 1700 new inmates to this brand new facility.
For Serco it's a never-before opportunity to test run their systems before the real deal - to make sure they get THIS jail right.
In truth, Serco's done a fantastic job thus far bringing employment to the Clarence Valley, and developing and supporting several community engagement projects. But hell, outside this forgotten enclave on the North Coast, they could do with a good news story, right?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Countless Aussies are now holed up at home as the coronavirus rages on – but the world’s elites are waiting out the pandemic in lavish style.
The unprecedented coronavirus crisis has battered the wider travel industry – but one area at least is booming.
As the pandemic escalates, Australian and global elites are choosing to self-isolate in style – and it has been a huge win for Australian luxury “home hotel” service Luxico.
According to co-founder and CEO Alexandra Ormerod, foreign travellers had been spending upwards of $200,000 to self-isolate in remote Australian properties – complete with their own helipad to fly in and out of – for the outbreak’s duration.

“We noticed when things really hit a couple of weeks ago (before borders closed), we started getting calls from international travel agents and clients directly – some who were pretty well known and well established businesspeople with celebrity status – from the US in particular who wanted to fly in on private jets and were looking for properties in regional areas, but which still had reasonable access to major cities via helicopter,” she said.
Ms Ormerod said some were isolating because they had family members in the high-risk category while others were simply after a “safe haven” to wait out the pandemic.
She said she had also received many similar inquiries from wealthy Australians who wanted to escape the cities either during the Easter break or for longer periods of time.

“We’ve even had guests who were booked in to stay in apartments in Sydney contact us to see if they can upgrade to a larger property, because they don’t want to share communal spaces or having to touch lift buttons – it’s on everyone’s mind,” she said.
“Obviously the travel industry has been hit really hard, but it has been surprising to see some people are still willing to pay to have a ‘holiday’ outside of the city so they can self-isolate away from people and still have a nice time with their family, as well as some cases where people are trying to protect everyone by moving their immediate family to a remote location.”
Ms Ormerod said clients had been looking for luxurious properties with lavish amenities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, horse riding facilities, helipads to ensure quick access to medical support if needed and separate accommodation on site for support staff like housekeepers or cooks.
“One of our guests had a $200,000 budget for two months, so $5000 a night was not a deterrent,” she said.
“Some people are thinking, ‘if we have to do this, we’ve got to make the most of it’.”
She said the regions that had been particularly in-demand were the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, the Hawkesbury and south coast regions of NSW and areas around Byron Bay and the Gold Coast in Queensland.
But unfortunately, the broader travel industry has not fared so well.
Aviation companies especially have taken a massive hit, with around 20,000 Qantas and Jetstar staff stood down amid the crisis.
There has also been a devastating flow-on effect for Australia’s tourist regions – many of which had already been battered by the summer’s brutal bushfires.
Meanwhile, Airbnb has announcing a new initiative to help connect those responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with safe and convenient places to stay while they carry out their critical work.
The company’s goal is to help house 100,000 healthcare professionals, relief workers, and first responders around the world. Airbnb will waive all fees for stays arranged through this initiative.

Josie Smith, who lost her husband to the summer’s bushfires, is calling on the community to co-operate with public health messages so others don’t suffer the same fate.
The widow of man who died at his Bodalla farmhouse during the December bushfires has called for the public to not underestimate the coronavirus pandemic.
On the day Josie Smith received a package from the NSW Government, containing the candle and flower used during the state memorial service for bushfire victims, she expressed her fears that other people may experience the grief she has felt since losing her husband, and father of her daughter, John Smith.
“We underestimated the bushfire and I lost my husband, the father of my lovely daughter. I can see how other people underestimate the virus outbreak this time, and I am scared that they might experience what I had been through,” she said in a heartfelt message to a South Coast community support group on Facebook.
It took almost a week for Mrs Smith to know what had happened to her late husband, who had stayed at the remote recluse to move the tools from the shed into the farmhouse to protect them from the oncoming New Year’s Eve bushfires.
The aged care worker outlined the struggle she faced to get support when resources were overstretched as the bushfires threatened numerous lives and communities along the south coast.
“I felt so helpless because the impact of the bushfires were too much that the police and the firies couldn't help me because they don't have enough manpower and the roads were inaccessible,” she wrote.
“So for six days, I was trying to keep my sanity while begging for help, calling triple 0 multiple times in a day and they said they would do everything they could, but the ramification of the fire was so intense that made it impossible to help me.”
Mrs Smith fears people will become victims to COVID-19 if they don’t take public health precautions seriously.
She has spoken out as 18 people have tested positive to the highly contagious virus.
“If the cases would soar, it would be too much for the health care workers to help you and you would be helpless.
“I work in (the) aged care sector and knowing that there are already cases in Eurobodalla and also aware that there are risk takers that are still thinking that they're invincible and still out with the community when they might have the virus, I experience anxiety attacks.
“Do your part to take care of your love (sic) ones and the community, and that's to take care of yourself. Don't take risks and don't let yourself or your love ones feel what I felt.”
The summer’s bushfires destroyed more than 400 homes and damaged more than 200 others.

March 25, 2020. Head of the Australian Border Force, Michael Outram speaks to the media in Canberra about the protocols surrounding the docking of the Ruby Princess which had a number of passengers infected with COVID-19. "We in the Border Force do not have expertise in health or in biosecurity," Mr Outram says. "New South Wales Health requested that Ruby Princess send the 15 samples to New South Wales Health lab for COVID testing and attach lab forms as required. New South Wales Health stated to the Ruby Princess, and I quote again: you are free to disembark tomorrow," he states. "New South Wales Health had conducted a risk assessment, had rated the risk as low, and that health officials would not be attending the vessel. As a result of that information, all passengers were given a green light to disembark," he concludes. (AAP Video/Marc Tewksbury)

We gather today at a time of great challenge for our nation and ­indeed the world. We are a strong nation and a strong people, but in the months ahead this will put us all to the test like at no time since World War II. Read the Prime Minister’s address to Parliament on Monday.
We gather today at a time of great challenge for our nation and ­indeed the world. We are a strong nation and a strong people, but in the months ahead this will put us all to the test like at no time since World War II.
But together, Australia, we are up to this challenge.
The coronavirus that is sweeping the world will continue to change the way we live. But we must not allow it to change who we are as ­Australians. I know, we all know, that Australians are very concerned at this difficult time.
It is the understandable fear of the unknown. And there is much that is not known about the coronavirus.
But we must not let that fear ­overtake us. We must instead focus on what we do know, what we can control.
We know who we are as people and the legacy and inspiration that has been given to us from those who have come before and shown us the way through challenge and tests just like this.
So we summon the spirit of the Anzacs, of our Great Depression generation, of those who built the Snowy scheme. Of those who won the great peace of World War II and defended Australia. That is our legacy that we draw on at this time.
We also know the actions that we can take.
The care, compassion and respect we must show to one ­another.
While some must self-isolate — and they must — and we all must keep a healthy distance between us, it is important that we do all we can to ensure in the difficult months ahead, that no Australian goes through this alone.
The responsibility we know, we must take for our own actions and our own behaviours.
The tests, hardships and sacrifices that will be placed on all of us, on our national character, will undoubtedly break our hearts on many occasions in the months ahead.
With spirit and resolve
But we must resolve today, as Australians, to come together and to pledge to each other across our nation that this coronavirus will not break our Australian spirit.
So together, and with the rest of the world, we face this unprecedented challenge.
A once-in-a-100-year event. A ­global health pandemic that has fast become an economic crisis, the like of which we have not seen since the Great Depression.
Life is changing in Australia, for every Australian. And life is going to continue to change.
For many, young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives.
Meeting this challenge is bigger than any Australian. It’s obviously bigger than politics.
It requires every single Australian to do their duty as public citizens.
So again, in that spirit, I want to thank in particular all the nation’s premiers and chief ministers for ­coming together to form Australia’s first ever national Cabinet. A Cabinet of all Australian governments.
Five Labor leaders, four Coalition leaders.
And I want to thank the leader of the Opposition for the co-operation he and his colleagues have afforded us here in this parliament, as we battle this dual health and economic crisis.
Today, we have some very important work to do, importantly to cushion the blow on Australians from the economic whirlwind that has been reaped by this coronavirus.
In the months ahead, we will face more issues that none of us, now, can imagine.
Our job as the Australian government is to work night and day to ensure our great country — our beloved Australia — gets to the other side and emerges stronger, safer and united.
Mr Speaker, Australians will be living with this virus, is our advice, for at least the next six months.
It could be longer. There is no three or four-week shutdown that makes it all goes away. No short-term solution to all of this.
Together we can slow it
We have to steel ourselves for the next six months and work together to slow the spread in order to save lives. To protect the elderly and vulnerable Australians. They are counting on us. Every extra bit of time we save allows us to better prepare for the challenges that are ahead.
It will be absolutely vital that every Australian respects and follows the healthy social-distancing measures that all Australian governments have implemented in order to flatten this curve and save lives.
Limits on outdoor and indoor mass gatherings. Keeping non-essential ­indoor gatherings to less than one person per four square metres.
Where possible, keeping 1.5m between yourself and others. Avoiding non-essential travel.
Even simply following good hygiene is essential to slowing this virus — washing your hands thoroughly, cough and sneeze into your elbow, don’t touch your face. All practical measures that we can all observe to save lives.
And I’ll say this, while you may not be able to go to church, the synagogue, the temple or the mosque, I most certainly call on all people of faith for you to pray. I can assure you, my prayer knees are getting a good workout.
Mr Speaker, as Australia works to flatten the curve and slow this virus, we also face an immense economic challenge.
providing support
Across Australia today, many thousands of Australians will lose their jobs. They are lining up at Centrelink offices as we speak — something unimaginable at this scale, only weeks ago. They have lost their jobs, many. And many more will.
So, we supercharge our safety net, doubling, effectively, the JobSeeker Payment and allowing Australians to draw on those resources they have put aside for such a time as this.
Support the most vulnerable with additional payment to pensioners, and carers and the disabled.
To provide a lifeline to small and medium-sized businesses, working together with the banks, and I thank them also, to keep those businesses afloat wherever possible. To keep as many employees as they can, but with the pledge and our support to them that when we pass this virus, those businesses that have had to stand people down, will stand them back up again on the other side.
We will get through this.
That they give them that assurance, that they give them that encouragement as they have to stand staff down, that they commit to do all they can on the other side to stand them back up again.
This is the unwritten contract that is being undertaken between employers and employees as we speak.
To provide also a legal shield to protect both businesses from closures, and individuals, to preserve our economy and to boost our recovery on the other side.
To those who have lost their jobs already and will, to those whose incomes are collapsing, to those who are barely holding their businesses together or have already seen their dream taken from them by this virus. This is devastating and it is heartbreaking, and we will do all we can in this parliament to help see you through.
We will be doing everything we can to protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of this crisis and to ­preserve the businesses that employ them.
There will be more support to come.
And it will keep coming for as long as this challenge is before this nation.
And even more importantly, when this passes, we will be there to ensure that Australians get back on their feet, that the businesses rebuild, that our economy resurges and that we go on in the great national story of this amazing nation, Australia.
This is an edited transcript of remarks made by Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the federal parliament yesterday.

The coronavirus outbreak crisis has prompted a delay to the start of the Super Netball season, meaning Adelaide Thunderbirds won’t be in action until June 30 at the earliest.
The world’s premier domestic netball league has been put on hold and the Super Netball (SN) season will not start until at least June 30.The SN league commission has postponed the season by two months on the latest COVID-19 medical and government advice.
In a statement on Monday, the commission said it had decided to delay the start of the season because of the rapidly-evolving landscape and as part of wider efforts to protect the wellbeing of fans, athletes, staff and the broader community.
Adelaide Thunderbirds were programmed to meet Giants Netball in Mile End on May 3, but the situation will be reviewed at the end of that month to determine whether a further delay is necessary.

Training for the eight SN teams has been suspended and league management will work with clubs and the Australian Netball Players’ Association to enable international and interstate athletes to return home.
“It is entirely understandable that there are athletes who would like to return home to family at this time,” the statement said.
The SN pre-season Cup scheduled for Sydney this weekend had already been scrapped.
Netball Australia has also delayed the second-tier Australian Netball League until at least June 30 as well.
“Netball is committed to playing its role to ensure we slow the spread of the virus and to finding ways that we can keep our communities healthy and connected,” the league said.
Netball Australia is still optimistic the quad series and Constellation Cup matches against New Zealand will go ahead in September and October and is working with the nations involved.

Woolworths are creating a physical barrier at check-outs as they say it’s the only way to adhere to new social distancing rules.
Woolworths continues to step up its social distancing measures in stores by adding plastic screens at its supermarket check-outs.
The store today confirmed it would be rolling out the screens at all of its supermarkets over the coming weeks as the Federal Government takes steps to enforce social distancing measures.
The screens are already installed in Sydney's Town Hall and Kellyville North stores, creating a physical barrier between staff operating check-outs and customers.
In a statement, Woolworths Supermarket's managing director Claire Peters said the chain would do "everything necessary to uphold public health and safety in our stores".
"We know it’s not always easy to maintain social distancing at our check-outs, so we’ve started installing plexiglass screens as an additional safeguard for our team members and customers," she said.
RELATED:  Follow the latest coronavirus updates
"We thank our customers for their understanding as we work through these challenging times together."
It comes after Woolworths on Friday introduced strict social distancing measures to combat the spread of coronavirus.
Customers have been asked to wash or sanitise their hands before shopping and maintain an appropriate distance from other people, using their trolleys as guide.
When lining up at check-outs, customers must follow floor markings on where to stand in order to stand apart from other shoppers.
Woolworths has also taken drastic steps to combat aggressive behaviour from shoppers in stores.
On Friday it told staff it was working to provide a security guard in every one of its stores, with the "vast majority" of Woolworths supermarkets having security over the weekend.
Supermarkets across the country have been turned into battlegrounds this month as anxious shoppers buy up big on essential items amid fears the coronavirus pandemic could impact store supplies.
Toilet paper was the first to be stripped from shelves, followed by rice, pasta, frozen vegetables and mince, forcing Coles, Woolworths and Aldi to introduce strict buying limits.
RELATED: Science behind toilet paper frenzy
Stoushes have also broken out in supermarkets, with two women charged with affray after a fight over toilet paper over a fight in Woolworths in the Sydney suburb of Chullora.
Footage of a Coles employee pushed to breaking point after being verbally abused by a customer while handing toilet paper has also circulated on social media.
In response to rising tensions inside supermarkets police have also stepped up their presence in stores and have even helped distribute toilet paper to customers.

While the coronavirus pandemic has forced the cancellations of a dozens of relief concerts, Cobargo residents remain upbeat and confident they will reach their fundraising target of $1 million for bushfire recovery.
Strict rules on mass gatherings due to COVID-19 has forced the closure of dozens of South Coast events aimed at lifting the spirit of bushfire-affected residents and inviting visitors to the regions.
Last week, organisers of the Cobargo Unites! benefit concert had to cancel the event because of COVID-19 restrictions on mass gatherings.
Concert producers Cobargo Folk Festival and Yuin Folk Club hoped to bring 5000 people to the town and raise $200,000 for the Cobargo Bushfire Recovery Fund.
The line-up was headlined by Australian country music superstar and 2008 Australian of the Year Lee Kernaghan, who was instrumental in raising funds for drought-affected communities.
Cobargo Folk Festival director Zena Armstrong said she received a phone call from Kernaghan’s manager Stephen White who was concerned the festival would be affected by the virus.
“I got a call when South By Southwest (music festival in Texas) was cancelled and Steve was saying ‘it was only a matter of time’.”
Following the cancellation of Tasmania’s Dark Mofo, Ms Armstrong suspected their bushfire relief concert would suffer the same fate.
And on March 16, the benefit gig to be held in May, was cancelled.
It is another blow for a community as it begins its rebuild after the devastating bushfires on New Year’s Eve, which destroyed more than 100 homes in Cobargo and neighbouring districts and killed four people.
But, organisers understood the importance of protecting the health of community as the pandemic evolves.
“It is with sadness that the Yuin Folk Club Cobargo and the Cobargo Folk Festival announce the cancellation of our Cobargo Unites! benefit concert because of coronavirus restrictions on mass gatherings,” Ms Armstrong said in a statement.
Following warnings about the length of time COVID-19 may impact Australia, Ms Armstrong said there were discussions about how to prevent further isolation for fire-affected residents of Cobargo and surrounding districts.
“Our primary focus is focusing on (minimising) social isolation for people. Many of these people are facing physical isolation.”
Despite the cancellation of the benefit concert, the Cobargo Bushfire Recovery fund has eclipsed the $500,000 mark with fundraising, musicians and a GoFundMe page contributing.
The goal is $1 million which will be used to regenerate the wider community and restore morale in residents.
“We’ve got some big supporters,” Ms Armstrong said.
“Lots of musicians are coming out to us, but now of course musicians are doing it tough.”

Bushfire recovery centres remain open amid the caronavirus pandemic and councils are now finding new ways to run town meetings while keeping everyone safe.
As restrictions begin to tighten in relation to thwarting the spread of COVID-19 and mass gatherings of people, South Coast councils are implementing new ways to continue the bushfire recovery response.
Bega Valley Shire Council hosted its first live Bushfire Recovery Community meeting through its Facebook page on Thursday, March 19.
Given the advice around coronavirus and people keeping a necessary social distance from each other, community meetings in Merimbula and Bemboka were being cancelled, host and BVSC media manager Ian Campbell said during the introduction of the broadcast.
Since the devastating fires about a dozen meetings have been held in the various districts, connecting agencies and officials with bushfire-affected residents.
And with the new restrictions, viewers are now being asked to submit questions to the panel including mayor Kristy McBain, council directors and managers and representatives of NSW Health and Public Works.
Weekly Facebook Live Recovery meetings will be held on Thursdays from 5.30pm, running for about 30 to 45 minutes. For those who miss the live recording, footage will also remain on the council’s Facebook page and distributed from its website.
The recovery centre at the Bega Valley Commemorative Civic Centre remains open Monday to Friday from 10am to 4pm. Fire-affected residents can also still access the mobile recovery outreach service.
The service is open between 10am and 2pm on Tuesdays (Quaama and Towamba halls), Wednesdays (Bemboka Hall and Wonboyn RFS shed), Thursdays and Saturdays (Eden Log Cabin and Cobargo Hall), and Fridays (Bermagui Community Centre and Wyndham Hall.
Further north, Shoalhaven Council advises residents that recovery centres will remain operational in response to Commonwealth Government COVID-19 public health measures, limiting non-essential public gatherings of 100 or less.
The council’s acting director of finance, corporate and community Jane Lewis said recovery centres were considered an “essential” service and it was important support was still available for those working towards recovery,
Numbers of people in recovery centres will be monitored and planning is underway to continue supporting the community via different mediums should the COVID-19 situation change.
“Please appreciate that we are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation and will continue to provide updates on the changing conditions as we receive advice from federal and state government,” Ms Lewis said.
“Support is still available for those seeking recovery assistance and we encourage affected residents to continue to reach out and work towards recovery. It is important to remind those who attend the recovery centres to maintain good hygiene practice and observe social distancing as advised by health officials.”
The COVID-19 health situation is evolving daily, and the situation may change with short notice, Shoalhaven Council advises.

The number of coronavirus cases in Australia is now well over 1200, with multiple states seeing significant spikes in recent days.
The number of coronavirus cases in Australia is doubling every three to four days and is now well over 1000, while the death toll remains at seven.
The total number of confirmed cases, based on a tally of numbers provided by health authorities in each state and territory, now stands at 1316.
There are 533 in New South Wales, 296 in Victoria, 259 in Queensland, 67 in South Australia, 120 in Western Australia, 17 in Tasmania, 19 in the Australian Capital Territory and five in the Northern Territory.
Authorities had predicted these numbers were expected to rise as Australians returned from abroad.
Eight of the new cases confirmed in the ACT on Sunday were linked to overseas travel.
Ten cases identified in South Australia yesterday were from a group of American tourists. The state’s Premier Steven Marshall is considering shutting its borders.
DEATH TOLL
Seven people have died – one in Western Australia and six in New South Wales.
Australia’s first coronavirus fatality was on Sunday, March 1.
He was a 78-year-old Perth man who was among 163 Australians evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and quarantined at Howard Springs in the Northern Territory.
The second death came on Tuesday, March 3. The 95-year-old woman was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, in Sydney’s north.
Two other residents of the same nursing home later died — an 82-year-old man on Sunday, March 8, followed by a 90-year-old woman on Saturday, March 14.
On Friday, March 13, a 77-year-old woman died in a Sydney hospital after recently arriving from Queensland. She had developed symptoms on the plane, was taken to hospital and died the same day.
An 86-year-old man died in a Sydney hospital on Tuesday, March 17, making him the state’s fifth death and the country’s sixth.
On Thursday, March 19, an 81-year-old woman died in hospital, bringing the death toll to seven. NSW Health said she had close contact with another confirmed case at Ryde Hospital.
CORONAVIRUS IN AUSTRALIA
Nationally, the numbers passed 400 on March 17. By Friday, March 20 that figure had more than doubled to over 800, and on Saturday it surged over 1000.
A large number of people in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s have been confirmed to have the disease.
Far fewer people aged over 70 or under 20 have been diagnosed with the coronavirus.
Where authorities have been able to determine the source of the infection, three times as many cases came from overseas travel as local transmission. The US and Italy have now overtaken China as the most common source country.
The first case of COVID-19 was detected on January 25 in Victoria.
The patient was a man from Wuhan, Hubei province — where the Chinese virus emerged late last year — who flew to Melbourne from Guangdong on January 19.
Three more cases were detected the same day in NSW.
All three were men who had recently returned from China — two had been in Wuhan and one had direct contact with a confirmed case from the virus epicentre.
Since then, the number of cases has risen exponentially.
NSW quickly became ground zero for the Australian outbreak, and now makes up nearly half of all cases in the country.
Experts fear that if Australia follows the same trend as similar countries where infections have doubled around every six days, there could be as many as 6000 by early April.

Five more people have tested positive to COVID-19, bringing the state’s total to 42. It comes as decommissioned hospitals will be brought back into action to prepare for the expected surge of cases.
Five new cases have been confirmed in SA, on top of the five yesterday, bringing the total to 42. Nineteen people are being cared for in hospital or at home.
A mother and baby who had the virus have just been discharged from Flinders.
In other developments today:
The Catholic Church cancelled all Easter mass services
The PM banned all travel to Australia for non-residents
The State Government deregulated shopping hours to allow for 24-hour supermarkets (see below)
Two hospitals were reopened in SA (see below)
The RBA cut rates to a historic .25 per cent

Five new virus cases in SA
The new cases are:
– Man in his 20s who had contact with a known case
– Woman in her 20s who travelled to the Gold Coast recently
– Man in his 40s who arrived from the Czech Republic
– Man in his 60s who arrived from the US
– Woman in her 60s who arrived from the US.
It’s been a “relatively mild” disease in SA so far, the state’s Chief Public Health officer Dr Nicola Spurrier said, but she warned the eastern states would see a peak in cases before SA.
There have been no recorded “community transmissions”, she said.
No one has been in intensive care in SA due to complications from coronavirus, she said.
Some of Thursday’s cases are likely to be treated at home.
Currently, eight people are being treated in the RAH for coronavirus and 11 patients are in a “home hospital program”.
Gyms will remain open, but Dr Spurrier warned SA our lives would change and everyone “had a part to play”.
She pleaded with people panic-buying to stop, saying it could hurt more vulnerable people.
Two hospitals reopened to deal with surge
An unused CBD hospital will be reopened for coronavirus cases as South Australia prepares for the impact of the pandemic.
The old Wakefield Hospital in the CBD will be set up, hopefully by next month, to care for “mildly acute” cases and provide 130 new beds.
And the old ECH College Grove facility at Walkerville will be recommissioned to take an overflow of non-coronavirus cases, bringing the total of new beds in SA’s health system to 188.
Wakefield Hospital joins other dedicated COVID-19 clinics at the RAH, Flinders and Women’s and Children’s Hospital.
“Wakefield Hospital will be dedicated to caring for mildly acute COVID-19 patients in a 130-bed facility,” Premier Steven Marshall said.
Health Minister Stephen Wade said it was planned for the RAH to treat adult COVID-19 patients, Flinders high-risk pregnant women, and WCH children.
“We will continue to engage with the private sector and all elements of the health sector to make sure South Australians impacted by the virus can receive the care they need in the most appropriate surroundings,” he said.
“We thank the new owners of the properties for their willingness to make the facilities available. We are all in this together.
The College Grove and Wakefield hospitals were both in use until just a few months ago, and Mr Wade said the facilities were suitable for patients and no structural works were required.
Both are expected to be operational by April 2020.
24-hour shopping allowed to hold off virus panic
Shops will be legally able to trade around the clock Monday to Friday under new emergency measures, as a wave of unprecedented bans transform South Australia amid the mounting coronavirus pandemic.
In a state-first designed to ensure all South Australians have access to adequate supplies, deregulated trading will last for 30 days from Saturday.
But unions have struck back, saying supermarkets are already closing early just to restock and finding it difficult to get new stock in the first place.
The announcement came after Prime Minister Scott Morrison labelled supermarket hoarding unpatriotic.
Multibillion-dollar bailouts are being finalised for the hospitality, tourism and education sectors – and five new virus cases emerged in SA, including a Flinders University student, 20.
The student has not been on campus for eight days, nor in contact with any staff or other students in that time.
Mr Morrison and Mr Marshall also told parents to keep children at school.
Under the new rules, SA shops will be able to trade 24 hours a day Monday to Friday, 12am to 9pm on Saturday, and 9am to 9pm on Sunday.
The exemption will begin on Saturday and finish on Sunday, April 19.
Treasurer Rob Lucas will on Thursday order the partial deregulation using special ministerial powers that has allowed suburban shopping centres to open on Boxing Day and later during November’s so-called Black Friday retail frenzy.
Mr Lucas told The Advertiser no shops would be forced to open, but he was confident the deregulation would be welcomed by traders.
“The Government has been horrified by some of the scenes we have seen in the last couple of weeks,” Mr Lucas said.
“We hope this will reduce some of that mayhem.”
Mr Marshall said the move was part of the Government’s strong plan to support the public in “very challenging times”.
“We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure not only is the community protected and jobs sustained, but that we get through this stronger and more resilient,” Mr Marshall said.
He said it would help maintain supply chains by allowing retailers to restock shelves and enable shops to consider designated time periods for customers – in similar ways that big chain and other independent supermarkets have already adopted for senior and disabled customers.
“This will give traders the opportunity to spread their customer load over a longer number of hours,” he said.
“We also anticipate this will help with jobs with more people needed to stock shelves.”
The State Government will also temporarily scrap rules that dictate when and where trucks can deliver and travel through suburban streets, to help with the supply chain.
“What we are seeing in our supermarkets and grocery stores is unprecedented,” Mr Marshall said.
“Businesses and employees are working around the clock to keep our shelves stocked with food, and this is a small but practical decision to make their lives easier in these challenging times.”
Local Government Minister Stephan Knoll said: “We have lifted planning restrictions around loading docks and opening hours to allow delivery of crucial supplies to supermarkets and grocery stores around the clock.”
However, SDA secretary Josh Peak, who represents supermarket workers, said it did not make sense because supermarkets were closing early in order to get stock replenished.
“Supermarket and supermarket supply chain workers are working around the clock to get
stock on the shelves and serve our communities,” he said.
“Longer trading won’t make this easier – it won’t put stock back on shelves any faster.
“All it will do is add pressure to an already stressed supermarket sector.”
“Retailers are currently reducing their hours – not extending them. This decision doesn’t
make sense and could potentially expose workers and the community to greater risk.”
Existing trading restrictions for Easter, including Good Friday, will remain in place. Supermarket giant Woolworths closed stores early nationwide on Wednesday night to restock shelves stripped bare by coronavirus panic.
Both Coles and Woolworths have restricted the first hour of trading to the elderly or people with a disability.
Mr Morrison, who bluntly warned Australians to “stop hoarding”, flagged potential new laws to prevent stockpiling goods if necessary.
It followed an eventful day, which saw the new national Cabinet order schools to stay open, a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, restrictions on aged-care home visits and advice to all citizens not to travel overseas.
In a historic first, official travel advice was lifted to the highest Level 4: Do not travel.
Large pubs, clubs, cinemas and restaurants will be forced to limit customers or close, as all “non-essential” indoor gatherings are restricted.
Chief medical officer Dr Brendan Murphy also advised on Wednesday: “No more handshakes, no more hugging – except in your family.”
For aged-care homes, family members, close friends and supports staff will still be able to visit residents, but it will be restricted to two people at a time per day and only short visits inside residents’ rooms rather than communal areas.
South Australian Independent Retailers hit back at the Government’s decision to allow supermarkets to throw open their doors 24 hours a day on weekdays, describing the move as “absurdity of epic proportions”.
The association’s chief executive officer Colin Shearing told ABC Radio Adelaide Wednesday morning the move was bad news for stores.
“This is not a good move – This is absurdity of epic proportions,” he said.
“I was in a meeting with the Premier yesterday and this was not even mentioned at that meeting, not even hinted at that meeting,” he said.
“We have not been consulted about this.
“And this is a time when we need to be supporting and backing our local independents because we have got great independents in this state and to say that we’re going open up hours and say it will all be all right – it won’t be all right because the demand from the customers will not cease at this stage.”
Mr Shearing said shops were needing to close earlier to restock stripped shelves and extending opening hours would compound the problem.
“Two days ago industry, particularly Woolies, made a statement, they want to close their doors early, at 8 o’clock,” he said.
“We don’t need more (shopping) hours. We need more hours to fill our stores.
“We do not need this and it will not work and it will exacerbate and it will just compound the whole issue what we’ve got out there at the moment.”
Mr Marshall responded to Mr Shearing’s statement.
“I’ve known Colin’s position for a long period of time but we’re in extraordinary times at the moment – we can’t just sit idly by,” he said.
Mr Marshall said he believed the Government had consulted adequately on the move.
When asked if South Australia would follow NSW’s lead in having police officers in supermarkets to quell aggressive behaviour, Mr Marshall said: “We’ll take all measures that are required but again, on this, we’ll take the advice of SAPOL.”

‘Worried well’ told to avoid clinics
Hundreds of “worried well” patients are flocking to dedicated coronavirus clinics despite failing specific medical criteria, official figures show, prompting the Premier to yesterday warn “panicked” people against unnecessary visits.
SA Health figures obtained by The Advertiser show of 2593 visits to the four Adelaide COVID-19 clinics over the past fortnight, doctors turned away 1617 patients – or 38 per cent of total cases.
Officials said tests were not given because people may have had virus symptoms, especially a fever or cough, but did not fit criteria such as overseas travel or contact with a positive case.
Premier Steven Marshall said the unprecedented clinic demand posed a “very important issue”. “There are too many ‘worried well’ people going along and really using very finite services that we have,” he said. “But this is not an opportunity for somebody that says ‘Look I have just got a ticklish throat, I am going to go down and have myself tested’.
“We need to preserve, and reserve, all of these testing kits for the people, who are in the most vulnerable cohort.
“I am going to be very, very strict about this. This is not an opportunity for people who are panicked by this to go down and be tested. They can self isolate if they want to.
“And if their situation moves into a cohort that requires a test, they will be given that test. But we are not going to start having loads and hordes of people lining up for an unnecessary test.”
His comments came after The Advertiser told of “overwhelming” scenes at the major metropolitan clinics – the Royal Adelaide, Lyell McEwin and Women’s and Children’s Hospital as well as the Flinders Medical Centre – with security guards used in certain spots.
SA Health figures show wait times vary from 20 minutes to up to three hours. More clinics are planned for Adelaide and various country areas.
The mounting demand has forced changes at the world leading Repat drive-through clinic amid claims the backlog was more than a week long.
Booking systems, which require a GP referral, have been changed from 20 minute-long appointments to five minute blocks. This has slashed wait times to an average three days.
SA’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Mike Cusack, urged patients failing the criteria to visit their GP as any respiratory tests will include coronavirus. He said there was no community spread evidence.

Keep kids in school: PM
The State Government says it will contact parents who are keeping their children out of school as the Prime Minister and Premier joined forces in pleading with parents to “keep our heads”.
But many families are ignoring official advice with absentee levels soaring as high as a third of students.
“We all love our kids, there’s nothing we wouldn’t do for them,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.
“But, as a father, I’m telling you I’m happy for my kids to go to school.
“There’s only one reason your kids shouldn’t be going to school, and that is if they are unwell.”
He said the disruption caused by closing schools would be severe. “Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more. This would include 40 per cent of health workers being impacted. That would put people’s lives at risk,” Mr Morrison said. “So let’s keep our heads as parents, let’s do the right thing by the county and each other. There is a national public interest here in keeping schools open.”
Premier Steven Marshall said it was “absolutely ridiculous” to suggest schools close two weeks early, extending holidays.
“There is no logic in taking kids out for two or three weeks,” Mr Marshall said.
“Parents are really making a conscious decision that they are not at school for the next six months.”
He said the next step would be the Government contacting parents. “We will certainly be looking at children that are not attending school and contacting their parents about what they are doing about homeschooling,” he said.
SA Primary Principals Association SA president Angela Falkenberg said schools were experiencing absentee rates up to 32 per cent. Catholic Education SA assistant director Bruno Vieceli estimated an absenteeism increase of about 15 per cent.
Messaging service MGM Wireless, which works with one in every five SA schools, said texts sent to parents asking why a child was absent nearly doubled across Monday and Tuesday to a total of 9600.
It said that was the “tip of the iceberg” for absenteeism, as it did not include all the parents who notified schools they were keeping children at home due to coronavirus. Wilderness School will extend the holidays by closing three and a half days early.
It also has asked families to collect boarders by the end of next week, with all students working remotely for the final week of term. Walford will next week ensure all 50 boarders go home safely. After that, all learning for both day and boarding students will be remote. From Monday, Adelaide University will run all lectures online only, in line with Flinders and UniSA.

A female patient has tested positive for coronavirus, but NSW Health has reassured the public that measures were being taken to protect other patients and staff.
A seventh case of coronavirus has been confirmed for the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, with a female patient testing positive for the virus at a local hospital.
On Thursday, NSW Health announced a female patient currently being treated at Shoalhaven Hospital had tested positive for COVID-19.
“NSW Health public health and infection control officers are urgently working with hospital staff to ensure all patients, staff and others who may have had close contact with the female patient are identified,” a spokesman for NSW Health said.
“These people are being contacted and will be in self-isolation for 14 days after their last contact with the confirmed case.”
The department said several mitigation strategies had been put in place to ensure the continuity of service at Shoalhaven Hospital.
On Wednesday, NSW Health confirmed six people in the Illawarra had tested positive for coronavirus. Each of these cases had been diagnosed in the past four days, with the district announcing the first diagnosis on Monday morning.
On Thursday afternoon, NSW had 307 confirmed cases of the deadly virus. Forty more people tested positive to coronavirus in the past day – 17 fewer than the previous day where cases rose by 57.

Nova’s Fitzy and Wippa - and several members of their team - are off air today after being forced to undergo testing at a Sydney hospital.
Nova radio hosts Ryan “Fitzy” Fitzgerald and Michael “Wippa” Wipfli have been forced to undergo coronavirus testing at a Sydney hospital after coming into contact with Richard Wilkins before his diagnosis.
Nine’s entertainment editor confirmed he had tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, less than a week after spending time with Rita Wilson backstage at her Sydney show and again on the  Today Extra  set when she came in for an interview.

Wilson and husband Tom Hanks were diagnosed with coronavirus last week.
The Hollywood stars’ announcement prompted everyone they had come into close contact with to get tested - including Wilkins, who also self-isolated immediately upon hearing the news on Thursday afternoon.
However, just hours before the news broke, the Nine host appeared in studio on the Fitzy and Wippa show for a special entertainment segment with Ten presenter Angela Bishop.
ON TODAY'S PODCAST: @RichardWilkins and @AngelaBishop dish their best celeb stories, we revisit Wippa's birthday party edition of 'Best Story Ever', PLUS 'Tom Time' returns! â°Listen: https://t.co/UCcEMDICxf pic.twitter.com/5OYaXwvVBl
Wilkins’ diagnosis prompted Fitzy, Wippa, their co-host Sarah McGilvray, executive producer Tom Ivey and other members of their team who were in contact with him to undergo testing at Sydney’s Royal North Shore Hospital.
Bishop also confirmed in a live cross from her home to Studio 10 on Monday morning that she’d been told to get tested and self-isolate, although she is not currently displaying any symptoms of the virus.
Their absence from Nova airwaves on Monday morning was addressed by replacement host Kent “Smallzy” Small, who explained what had happened.
“We have the Fitzy and Wippa team in isolation this morning after the breaking news last night was that Richard Wilkins has tested positive for coronavirus,” Smallzy told listeners.
A short time later, Wippa called in to the show to give an update and express his sympathy for Wilkins.
“We’ve all now been tested and we’re at home, but I feel for (Wilkins), he was called out and didn’t want the knock-on, or flow-on effect of where everybody stands now,” Wippa explained, adding that Nova management had contacted him with the news on Sunday night.
“A call went around last night, and at the same time there was a doctor we could talk to as well, which was important for us because Lisa (Wipfli’s wife) is pregnant, there’s a baby on the way.”
Wippa described the bizarre experience of being tested along with the rest of his team at the Royal North Shore Hospital.
“It was certainly a different type of planning meeting than we’ve ever had before - when we had everybody last night at a special clinic that had been set up, and the whole team was there in face masks.”
Wippa added that they had been considered “borderline” for testing due to the amount of “time and contact” they’d had with Wilkins but were keen to avoid any possibility of carrying the infection.
“We didn’t want to be caught out like Dickie was, we just wanted to make sure we did the right thing and cover ourselves,” he said.
In a statement to news.com.au, Nova Entertainment’s chief programming and marketing officer Paul Jackson confirmed the team would now be self-isolated for 14 days, as per government health requirements, and the Nova studios and premises “will continue to be thoroughly cleaned and sterilised”.
“Nova 96.9’s breakfast team will be equipped with technology that will allow them to broadcast from their respective homes from tomorrow,” he said, adding that “most of our Sydney staff will work from home” until at least the end of the week.
Wilkins, who is now quarantined in his home on Sydney’s North Shore, also called in during the show.
“I’ve never felt better - it’s absolutely bizarre to find myself with this thing we’ve all been talking about, we’ve been covering. I’ve been interviewing people about it and, suddenly, you could have knocked me over with a feather last night when I got the call from the NSW Health people, who said, ‘You’ve tested positive’,” he told the radio host.
“I caught up with Rita Wilson a week ago when she played at the Opera House, I popped in there, spoke for no more than 90 seconds, two minutes, ‘Great show’, you know how it is, posted a selfie.
“Of course on Thursday when the news came out that she and her hubby Tom Hanks had tested positive, it was a bit of a trip-out in there at Channel 9, we didn’t know what to do. “So those of us who had contact with her went and got tested, seemed the responsible thing to do - even though I thought there was zero chance.
“That was Thursday afternoon, and of course on Thursday morning I was in there in that studio talking to our good friends Fitzy and Wippa and it’s so - I just feel so bad, it’s no one’s fault, I don’t even know if it was Rita, you don’t know.”
A Channel 9 spokesman confirmed Wilkins’ news on Sunday and said: “Richard is not showing any symptoms of the virus and has been self-isolating on his own at home since Thursday last week.
“Since he is still without symptoms the authorities advise that he has not knowingly put others at risk, although anyone he has been in contact with prior to Thursday afternoon has been notified and will be tested if they show any symptoms of the virus.”
Today Extra hosts David Campbell and Belinda Russell are also both in self-isolation because they also came in contact with Wilson at Nine, although both hosts have tested negative for the coronavirus.

Australian schools are preparing for extended closures in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

A second staff member at a Melbourne school became the second confirmed case of human-to-human transmission in Victoria after they contracted the virus. 

Several schools in New South Wales also closed briefly this week due to the virus. 

Education Minister Dan Tehan said the sector was working on a consistent response from schools affected by the virus.

Schools in NSW and Victoria will be closed today as education departments implement new procedures to deal with the spread of coronavirus. 

Two Year 10 students at St Patrick’s Marist College in Dundas, Sydney, along with their fathers were diagnosed with COVID-19 this week. 

A Year 7 student from Willoughby Girls High School and her mother have also been confirmed to have the virus. 

New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard said if a student or teacher contracted the virus, their school would be shut for at least one day. 

He warned school closures would become the "new norm" as the state worked to contain the virus. 

Meanwhile, The Carey Baptist School has become Victoria's first school hit by COVID-19 and will also be shut on Tuesday while the grounds are cleaned. 

Authorities have told parents if their child is showing signs of respiratory illness, they must be kept at home.

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/breaking-news/australians-charged-up-to-1400-for-balcony-access-in-hotel-quarantine/news-story/aa672da4f32f4d5da35dbdb426791562
A woman who endured hotel quarantine says charging extra for rooms with balconies and access to fresh air is ‘outrageous’ and ‘cruel’.
Australians stuck in hotel quarantine are being slugged up to $1400 for the privilege of fresh air during their quarantine stays, which already start at $3000.
Returned overseas travellers pay the NSW government a standard minimum fee of $3000 to stay at the hotels serving as quarantine facilities, such as the Meriton, Radisson Blu or Sheraton.
But rooms with balconies or access to fresh air are not among the conditions the hotels are obliged to provide.
Queenslander Eliza Kruger, who returned from the US in November, paid an extra $500 for a tiny balcony at the Radisson Blu in Sydney in November.
Ms Kruger, 34, said while she could afford it, she was troubled the extra charge would lock out those less fortunate.
“It is outrageous that access to fresh air is only available to those who can afford it,” Ms Kruger told NCA NewsWire.
“For many, the cost to return home is financially catastrophic, charging even more for access to fresh air is cruel.
“I estimated my flight and hotel quarantine cost $8600 for one person. For families or those coming from places with fewer flights, the cost can be many times higher.”
Ms Kruger even emailed her local member in Queensland, Ted O’Brien, to express her concerns.
“The Australian government needs to balance protecting Australia from COVID-19 with the health and safety of returning Australians,” Ms Kruger said.
“The current system of 14 days of hotel quarantine for every returning traveller, despite testing negative many times, is not the solution.”
Radha Govil, a lawyer in Switzerland for the United Nations, told the ABC she paid $1,400 for a room with a balcony during her quarantine at the Meriton Suites on Sussex Street in Sydney in November.
Ms Govil and her husband had already paid $4000 (the charge for two adults) but needed fresh air for their seven-month-old baby. Ms Govil was later given a $400 discount from Meriton.
Professional golfer Travis Smyth is currently in quarantine in Sydney’s Sheraton hotel after returning from playing in the US for upcoming Australian tournaments.
He is unable to open the windows in his room and has no access to fresh air.
Smyth does not think it is unfair to charge extra for a room with a balcony.
“I don’t think so; the rate works out to be $215 a night and I wouldn’t normally get a balcony for that price anyway,” he told NCA NewsWire.
However he pointed out it was not always available even for those willing to pay. “Nothing is available until my last four days in here and I’m not sure if I’ll switch rooms,” he said.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has warned against complacency as the state again recorded no new cases of COVID-19.
The death of a pregnant woman, her partner and a motorcycle rider is forcing the Queensland government to change its youth bail laws.

Health authorities have issued an alert after being notified of NSW residents who’d been in the Qld hotel linked to six cases of the UK mutant virus.
Health authorities are scrambling to identify NSW residents who had recently been at the Hotel Grand Chancellor in Brisbane amid fears they could spread a highly contagious strain of COVID-19.
Returned travellers or staff who have been at the hotel since December 30 should immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days after they were last at the hotel regardless of their test result.
They should also call 1300 066 055 for further advice, NSW Health said in a statement on Wednesday evening.
Six cases of the concerning coronavirus variant have been linked to the hotel.
“This variant is known to spread more easily from person to person than other strains of the COVID-19 virus,” NSW Health said.
“The Queensland government has notified NSW Health there were NSW people staying at the hotel who have since returned to NSW.”
The hotel is believed to have been used for returned travellers only.
“NSW Health is working with Queensland Health to identify these people, so our contact tracers can provide public health advice and updated information as it becomes available,” NSW Health said.
An earlier alert from NSW Health said anyone who went to the Groomsmen Barber Shop inside Warriewood Square between 11.30am and 12pm on January 6 must get tested and isolate until they get their result.
Two new cases on the northern beaches were revealed on Tuesday, and are yet to be linked to the current outbreak which has put tracers on edge.
“This highlights the importance for everyone in the northern beaches to maintain vigilance because we’ve seen now a couple of cases or so in the last several days of people in the area being diagnosed with COVID-19,” deputy chief health officer Jeremy McAnulty said.
“Particularly in that community, be very vigilant, come forward for testing if you have even the mildest of symptoms.”
Several other businesses in Warriewood were also listed as exposure sites on Tuesday, including major supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths.

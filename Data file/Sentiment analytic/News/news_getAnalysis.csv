['Police said 70 lives were saved when officers in Delhi towed a broken-down truck carting medical oxygen to a hospital on May 3. Police said the truck was headed for Sonia Hospital Nangloi when it broke down. Hospitals across the country are struggling to meet the demand for oxygen from COVID-19 patients. Footage released on Twitter shows officers attaching their white police van to the truck. Rather than wait for the towing crane, officers took it upon themselves to tow the truck 3.5 km (2.2 mi) to the hospital, likely saving the lives of 70 coronavirus patients, Delhi Police wrote. On May 5, India reported 382,315 new cases of coronavirus and 226,188 total deaths.
